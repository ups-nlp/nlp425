fp	2 utt3	A	and I'm calling from Garland, Texas.
	b	3 utt1	B	Yeah,

co^t	4 utt4	A	so. anyway, let me press one.
	aa	5 utt1	B	Okay .

sd	8 utt5	A	and, it was an experience that I won't do again .
	qw	9 utt1	B	How big a family do you have?

sd	10 utt10	A	We saw people we hadn't see in a while
	qy	11 utt1	B	Did you have people coming from far away?

sd(^q)	14 utt2	A	and we're going, my gosh.
	sv	15 utt1	B	Well you have

b	18 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	19 utt1	B	And if, they come from far away, they take it more seriously

aa	22 utt2	A	I think you're right.
	b	23 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	24 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	25 utt1	B	My family's not very big

qw^d	26 utt1	A	Your family's from where?
	sd	27 utt1	B	Well, I have a, a brother lives in Indianapolis, a sister lives in Chicago, and my folks live back in Buffalo, New York.

ba	28 utt1	A	no.
	sd	29 utt1	B	I guess we have reunions about once a year or so.

b	30 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	31 utt1	B	We got together over Christmas.

ba	32 utt1	A	those are nice.
	aa	33 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	34 utt1	A	And I'm sure they're a lot more organized too, because they've done it before.
	aa	35 utt1	B	Yeah,

ba	36 utt1	A	That's great.
	sd	37 utt2	B	and every year everyone asks when is it happening and where is it happening

b	40 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	41 utt1	B	and they just plan on being here.

ba	42 utt4	A	well that's great.
	b	43 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	46 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	47 utt1	B	So it was good, it, it worked out very well.

b	48 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	49 utt2	B	One interesting thing that they did at the time is they videotaped the whole shebang it made a nice remembrance of the entire party.

bf	52 utt2	A	more people want to come back again.
	aa	53 utt1	B	Yeah,

ba	54 utt2	A	that's good.
	sd	55 utt1	B	So, so that works pretty well that way.

sd	56 utt7	A	and, it sounds really neat, it really does.
	aa	57 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	62 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	63 utt1	B	I don't know how you would go about, getting them together,

sd	64 utt6	A	and they have a really good for the whole weekend.
	b	65 utt1	B	Yeah,

qy	1 utt2	A	so, do you own a P C?
	nn	2 utt1	B	no,

qy^d	3 utt1	A	But you have one at work.
	ny	4 utt1	B	Yes,

sd	5 utt3	A	see I'm doing my, Master's in Computer Science and Computer Engineering.
	b	6 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	7 utt2	A	but I have to use them, like especially during my undergrad.
	b	8 utt1	B	Right.

sv	11 utt3	A	You know, like it's easier for you to go to and run a program, you know, through the disk, because, the grader can do it at home.
	b	12 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	17 utt2	A	and you have to have so many people sharing the same data, that you can't use personal computers, so you have to use, you know, a main frame.
	b	18 utt1	B	Uh huh.

bk	21 utt1	A	okay.
	sd	22 utt1	B	And, that's been my situation, is that, that way I can get in, access our, computers that I have up here and, you know, do work from home.

qy	23 utt1	A	But does it have, like, a disk drive?
	ny	24 utt1	B	yeah.

sd	25 utt2	A	because, the ones that we use, you know, are like UNIX base systems.
	b	26 utt1	B	Right.

sd	27 utt1	A	And, so they don't have a disk drive.
	b	28 utt1	B	Right.

sd	29 utt2	A	the only way that you can do it is through a modem.
	b	30 utt1	B	Right.

sd	31 utt1	A	And, you know, you just do it that way.
	b	32 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	33 utt2	A	you can't store it anywhere.
	aa	34 utt1	B	Right.

bk	35 utt1	A	okay.
	b	36 utt1	B	Uh huh,

bf	37 utt1	A	And then you also have to do all your grading on the P C.
	sd	38 utt1	B	Well, that's the really neat thing, I teach in the continuing education classes, so I don't have to have any grades, no grade books, so that's great .

bk	39 utt1	A	okay.
	o	40 utt1	B	But, no,

b	43 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	44 utt1	B	so I think it's extremely helpful and very useful.

sd	45 utt1	A	Well, for us you know, it's like for doing like, you know, like resumes, and, presentations.
	b	46 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	49 utt1	A	We use like for example, a Mackintosh, which is a lot easier for graphics, than you know, the I B M P C's or anything compatible with that.
	b	50 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	53 utt1	A	due to the fact that, well, you know, I haven't tested the P S two yet.
	b	54 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	55 utt1	A	but I don't know if the software is as easily, you know, like you can manage it a lot easier than the old one.
	b	56 utt1	B	Right.

sd	57 utt1	A	The old one you had to go pick a line, use little arrows to go onto the screen and check where you wanted to start, and where, you know, with the mouse you do it, you know, like, a hundred times faster.
	b	58 utt1	B	Right.

sd	61 utt5	A	and that's the way it's going to print out.
	b	62 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	63 utt1	A	And, especially if you have a laser printer, it's going to print out the same way as it's on the screen.
	b	64 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	65 utt1	A	And, so, you know, with the I B M what would happen is, since the software that I had was, it was basically, you know, you only see part of the page.
	b	66 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	67 utt1	A	And, so, the whole page you never can actually see it,
	b	68 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	69 utt3	A	and, you know, it's like, every time that you have to do something it's really a pain.
	ba	70 utt1	B	What a hassle,

sd	71 utt2	A	it's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a P C.
	b	72 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	73 utt2	A	You know, like years back when you didn't have that you would have to map out all these numbers.
	b	74 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	75 utt1	A	and get a graph which you weren't sure if it was okay or not, you know.
	b	76 utt1	B	Right.

sd	77 utt1	A	But, with a new system I can calculate everything so fast, you know, like for spread sheets.
	b	78 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	81 utt1	A	You can see what the trend is over the years.
	b	82 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	83 utt1	A	Yeah,
	sv	84 utt1	B	they have really simplified things.

sd	85 utt4	A	and the other one I had the program running. so if there was ever a mistake, I could easily check, you know,
	b	86 utt1	B	Right.

sd(^q)	87 utt2	A	I could look at the program and say, this is where I made the error.
	b	88 utt1	B	Right.

sd(^q)	89 utt1	A	Instead of saying, where did I make the error?
	b	90 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	91 utt3	A	the old ones you had to go out of your program, well load up the program again, in this case.
	b	92 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	93 utt2	A	After you load it up change it, hope that's right, get out of that, run the program, run, uh huh, as long as it took, and then go back and see if that worked or not.
	b	96 utt1	B	Yes.

sd	101 utt2	A	and say it messed up in line fifty four.
	b	102 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	103 utt3	A	and you can see where it messed up, because, you know it's like in the old computers, the ones that, we're using here a couple of years ago, you would always have to have a printout, every time that you ran your program, * end of slash unit? you would need a printout because everything else was erased in the background. / * should have been new slash unit
	b	104 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy	109 utt1	A	did, did you learn it in computer science?
	ny	110 utt1	B	yeah,

qw	111 utt1	A	And, when was this.
	sd	112 utt1	B	I graduated in eighty six.

bk	113 utt1	A	okay.
	b	114 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	115 utt2	A	I know because, all I know is that when I came here in eighty seven, it was the last year to put all your punch cards in.
	^2	116 utt1	B	The cards.

sd(^q)	119 utt4	A	and they go, my God, they're still using this.
	b	120 utt1	B	Yes.

sd	121 utt2	A	and, you know , You can get a hard copy of it,
	ba	122 utt1	B	Wow,

sd	123 utt2	A	and that's about it.
	b	124 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	125 utt2	A	They said that, if the auto industry would have kept the same trend as the computer industry has ever since, you know, it started, they said that, cars would cost two dollars
	b	126 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	127 utt2	A	and they would run forever.
	sv	128 utt1	B	that would be great.

sd(^q)	131 utt2	A	it's like, yeah, you know, when your, car runs out of gas just throw it away.
	b	132 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	133 utt1	A	And, that's the way it would be.
	ba	134 utt1	B	Wow.

sd	137 utt4	A	an I B M P C in like in nineteen eighty one it would cost you five thousand dollars,
	aa	138 utt1	B	sure,

sd	139 utt1	A	and now you can get it, you know, like for, one thousand dollars, you know, because of the parts basically.
	aa	140 utt1	B	Right.

sd(^q)	141 utt3	A	they're not charging you, you know, over pricing, it because it's like, if we sell it for less, you know, it's like we're losing money, you know.
	b	142 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd(^q)	145 utt1	A	It's like we want to sell it to break even at least.
	b	146 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	147 utt1	A	And, I think they stopped producing the I B M P C.
	b	148 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	149 utt1	A	and the, P C Junior was a total failure, to them.
	b	150 utt1	B	Oh.

sd(^q)	155 utt2	A	it's like, sure bring out. N , into the market something that's smaller when nobody uses anything that's smaller than, you know, this, you know.
	b	156 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	161 utt3	A	and, Mackintosh took a lot of the market from a lot of schools.
	b	162 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	163 utt2	A	you can work with it a lot easier.
	aa	164 utt1	B	Yeah.

ad	165 utt2	A	well, I'll leave you back to your work.
	aa	168 utt1	B	Okay.

fx	169 utt1	A	And, have a good lunch.
	ft	170 utt1	B	Thanks.

qo	2 utt7	A	How about yourself?
	b	3 utt1	B	Yeah.

aa	4 utt2	A	True.
	sd	5 utt2	B	we have a one year old in the house

b*	6 utt1	A	Huh uh.
	sv	7 utt2	B	I have to say, during the war the American public was probably flooded with too much information

sv	8 utt3	A	my personal opinion is that the various network news medias were trying to interpret the news to the best of their abilities since they were not very well informed by the military.
	aa	9 utt1	B	True.

sd	10 utt1	A	Now, I can appreciate that, especially after what happened in Vietnam.
	aa	11 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	12 utt2	A	today's, means of communication, a newscaster could very well giveaway a piece of top secret information. And, pat himself on the back for, making a good scoop.
	b*	13 utt1	B	Huh uh.

sd	18 utt2	A	I find T News very enlightening, too.
	b	19 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	20 utt2	A	Of course, with that goes along with the stock price of T I.
	aa	21 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	22 utt1	A	Of course, T NEWS is more or less headlines,
	b*	23 utt1	B	Huh uh.

sd	24 utt1	A	I don't think much of their sports coverage.
	aa	25 utt1	B	Yeah

sd	26 utt1	A	Only give the scores.
	b	27 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	28 utt2	A	outside of pro football, I'm not too interested in other games, other sports, anyway.
	aa	29 utt1	B	Huh uh.

sv	30 utt2	A	I think they do a pretty good job of selecting the most important items.
	aa	31 utt1	B	Yeah.

b*	32 utt1	A	Huh uh.
	sv	33 utt1	B	but you need to continue to read, so you people learn to read, you know .

sd	34 utt2	A	and I know what it takes to get some of those little bits and pieces of news on the air,
	b*	35 utt1	B	Huh uh.

sd	36 utt4	A	One of the fellows got mixed up in a riot that was going on down there,
	b*	37 utt1	B	Huh uh.

sd	38 utt3	A	they left him alone.
	fe	39 utt1	B	Ouch.

aa*	40 utt1	A	Huh uh.
	sv	41 utt1	B	That's tough.

nn	44 utt1	A	No.
	sd^t	45 utt1	B	Really I just got mine in the mail

sd^t	46 utt2	A	Well I'll be looking for it then.
	sv*	47 utt1	B	There not to shabby. / * Correction "They're not too shabby"

bh	48 utt1	A	Is that right?
	ny	49 utt1	B	Yeah.

o@	50 utt1	A	Well, good. * slash error You, too.
	fc	51 utt1	B	Have a great day.

sd	2 utt1	A	I was thinking about whether or not we should have people, be required to do public service for a year or two.
	b	3 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	4 utt3	A	I mean, you can't make it everybody.
	aa	5 utt1	B	Right,

sv	6 utt1	A	But then you need to make it sure that the rich people can't buy somebody off and maybe send them in their places or get out of it some other way too.
	aa	7 utt1	B	Uh huh,

^g	10 utt2	A	right.
	br	11 utt1	B	What did you say?

sv	12 utt2	A	and they all had to pass.
	aa	13 utt1	B	yeah.

sv	16 utt1	A	I thought it a good idea too, though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money.
	aa	17 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sv	18 utt3	A	so they could subsist.
	aa	19 utt1	B	Well that's true.

b	20 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	21 utt1	B	Because, actually, when you do, service overseas you end up learning something, usually that's really useful, plumbing, or farming, or something like that,

sv	22 utt4	A	So what we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country.
	br	23 utt1	B	What did you say?

sd	24 utt1	A	I'm just teasing .
	b	25 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	26 utt2	A	and children from their countries came over to ours too, a trade off.
	aa	27 utt1	B	Yeah,

aa	28 utt1	A	Yeah.
	b	29 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	30 utt1	A	And other than that, I can't think of any other ideas.
	b	31 utt1	B	Yeah,

bf	32 utt1	A	with W P A.
	aa	33 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	34 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	35 utt2	B	the work program and all the make work jobs.

sd	36 utt1	A	And we're still using those things too.
	br	37 utt1	B	What did you say?

sd^r	38 utt1	A	We're still using those things.
	aa	39 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	42 utt1	A	They built lodges before too, like at Caddo Lake.
	br^m	43 utt1	B	Lake what?

sd^r	44 utt1	A	Caddo Lake.
	b^m	45 utt1	B	Caddo Lake.

sd	46 utt2	A	it crosses into both of them.
	o	47 utt1	B	No,

sd	48 utt2	A	it's like a swamp.
	b	49 utt1	B	Oh .

sd	50 utt1	A	You know with all the Spanish moss on the trees, it's eerie.
	bk	51 utt1	B	okay,

qw	54 utt2	A	where are you from?
	sd	55 utt1	B	Virginia.

sd^t	56 utt3	A	I talked to somebody from Ohio the other night.
	aa	57 utt1	B	yeah,

sd	58 utt5	A	I can't remember.
	bf	59 utt1	B	Politicians pushing it, or, or Mitch Snider. Or Mitch Snider.

sd	64 utt1	A	Mitch Snider, I don't know who Mitch Snider is.
	bk	65 utt1	B	okay,

b	66 utt1	A	Yeah.
	b	67 utt1	B	Yeah,

qw^t	68 utt1	A	What have your other topics been?
	sd^t	69 utt2	B	the other topic was, like I said, something about politicians.

sd(^q)^t	70 utt2	A	It was what meal would you cook for, special dinner .
	ba	71 utt1	B	Gee whiz ,

qh	72 utt1	A	How far can you go with that one,
	b	73 utt1	B	Yeah.

^q^t	74 utt2	A	and what do you think has caused some of the social problems.
	b	75 utt1	B	Uh huh,

^q^t	76 utt4	A	and what should we do about it?
	b	77 utt1	B	Uh huh.

aa	78 utt2	A	right.
	^q	79 utt1	B	Cleaner ways of burning coal

^2	80 utt1	A	Because we don't have much coal.
	ar	81 utt1	B	we have a lot of coal .

sd	82 utt1	A	In Virginia.
	sv	83 utt1	B	But, it's a dirty fuel, that's for sure.

qw^t	84 utt2	A	well how did you get into this program.
	b^m^t	85 utt1	B	Excuse me. How did I get into it,

qy^d	86 utt1	A	For T I.
	nn	87 utt1	B	No.

b^m	88 utt1	A	No.
	nn^r	89 utt1	B	no,

qy^t	90 utt1	A	So does your company have something to do with T I.
	ng	91 utt1	B	not really,

b	92 utt1	A	Huh,
	sd(^q)^t	93 utt1	B	they just sent out a letter to everybody they do business with saying, that you know, if you're interested we're doing a study

qy^t	94 utt1	A	And do you know how long this is supposed to go on.
	no	95 utt1	B	I don't know,

sd^t	96 utt5	A	but then it seems like it might be longer than a week.
	b	97 utt1	B	Right.

qw^t	98 utt1	A	So what do you think we're going to get?
	br^m	99 utt1	B	What do you think,

qw^r^t	100 utt1	A	What do you think we're going to get for this?
	br^m	101 utt1	B	Get.

qy^d^t	102 utt2	A	prizes.
	no	103 utt1	B	I don't know.

qy^t	104 utt1	A	Do you know anybody that's ever done this?
	sd^t	105 utt1	B	you're going to get you own T I seven thirty two or something.

sd^t	106 utt1	A	I know T I gets prizes.
	sd	107 utt1	B	I didn't hear about that.

sd	108 utt2	A	I'm not T I.
	bf*	109 utt1	B	your not, / * typo your > you're

aa	110 utt1	A	Huh uh.
	bk	111 utt1	B	okay.

sd^t	112 utt2	A	and she saw this on her computer and thought it might be neat,
	b	113 utt1	B	Oh.

sd^t	114 utt2	A	so she ran off copies of the thing.
	b	115 utt1	B	Oh.

sd^t	116 utt1	A	And I just signed up for it.
	ba	117 utt1	B	that's a neat idea.

b	118 utt1	A	Yeah.
	b	119 utt1	B	Uh huh,

b	120 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv^t	121 utt1	B	That's good, especially since you call that one eight hundred number

sv	122 utt1	A	And it shouldn't be too good right now anyway, because they've been laying off so many people.
	aa	123 utt1	B	Yeah

sv^t	124 utt3	A	so we're footing the bill on our taxes.
	b	125 utt1	B	Okay.

fc	126 utt4	A	bye.
	sd	127 utt1	B	I'm going to save my two year old from the pile of grapes she's diving into.

sd	128 utt1	A	Well I'm going to try to clean up the house after my two children for about an hour see if we can walk around.
	b	129 utt1	B	Okay

fc	130 utt1	A	Bye.
	fc	131 utt1	B	Bye bye.

sd	1 utt3	A	and so I really don't receive any benefits right now .
	b	2 utt1	B	Right .

sd	3 utt6	A	and and, right now we have probably some excellent benefits right now.
	aa	4 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	5 utt4	A	but we're real happy with them.
	b	6 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	7 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	8 utt2	B	I'd say health care is way up there, especially anybody with kids.

b	9 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	10 utt2	B	and does the company pay for it. You know, all or partially

b	11 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	12 utt1	B	And, also, vacation time too is a big one for me. and I guess support for whatever other, you know, kinds of professional activities you have at, you know, work.

b	17 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	18 utt1	B	cause I've been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer any and sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though,

b	21 utt1	A	Right.
	sv	22 utt2	B	so that's not so bad, you know.

b	23 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	24 utt1	B	You know, it's kind of a give and take kind of thing, I think.

b	25 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	26 utt1	B	I say that health care is probably definitely number one though.

sv	31 utt2	A	and, and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices on who to go with.
	b	32 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	33 utt4	A	and it's worked out really good for us too.
	b	34 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	37 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	38 utt1	B	cause that makes a big difference.

b	39 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	40 utt1	B	And she works, as a assistant manager in a fabric store.

b	41 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	42 utt1	B	And so she works a lot of evenings and weekends

ba^r	43 utt2	A	That's really good.
	aa	44 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	45 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	46 utt1	B	And I think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too.

b	47 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	48 utt1	B	I mean usually, you know, you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting, up for school

b	49 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	50 utt1	B	And especially in the winter. I mean, you get up in the dark and come home in the dark you know.

sd	53 utt1	A	Worked out really well for us too.
	b	54 utt1	B	Yeah.

qy	55 utt1	A	Well is there anything else that you look for
	sd	56 utt1	B	a lot of I guess is.

sv	57 utt2	A	you've put a lot of the main points in.
	aa	58 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	59 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	60 utt2	B	especially in large corporations. You can really, you know, wind up having, you know, real problems I've found out.

b	63 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	64 utt4	B	I work with, computer systems a lot.

b	65 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	66 utt2	B	It's real hard to rate something like that.

b	67 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	68 utt1	B	It's like get a painter, you know, or something, a artist.

ad^t	1 utt2	A	Tell me about your ideas on this, the U S government supporting health insurance and so forth.
	sv	2 utt1	B	Well, I think it's inevitable that we are going to see national health care

qw	3 utt1	A	Well what is this going to do the insurance companies who are supporting this work now and hopefully are doing, a good job?
	sv	4 utt1	B	Well, it's going to make it tough for them

aa	5 utt1	A	Yes.
	sv	6 utt1	B	And, as a society we are paying a staggering price for this.

sv	9 utt4	A	matter of fact, in some respects their life might depend on it.
	b	10 utt1	B	Right.

sv	11 utt1	A	But, by the same token some of these charges they make for well, minor endeavors, shall we say on the parts the doctors are really out of line.
	b	12 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	17 utt5	A	and they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it.
	aa	18 utt1	B	Right.

sd	21 utt2	A	My wife and I both have had that recently.
	sd	22 utt1	B	I've had one myself

b	23 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	24 utt1	B	So, I think the evolution will be interesting.

sd	25 utt1	A	See, that bothers me about the government see,
	sv	26 utt1	B	Well that's the problem with government, administration of these programs

qr	27 utt1	A	Do you think that that these insurance things should be covered on a State basis or U S government basis?
	^h	28 utt1	B	You know, that is really a tough one for me to answer.

sd^t	1 utt2	A	there we go.
	b	2 utt1	B	Okay,

qy	3 utt1	A	So, do you play golf at all?
	ny	4 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	5 utt1	A	Actually, I don't.
	bh	6 utt1	B	really.

sd	7 utt4	A	so I just stopped playing.
	sd	8 utt1	B	well, my husband is a very good golfer.

sv	9 utt2	A	that is real good.
	sd	10 utt2	B	and he has been playing since we have been married for twenty two years.

bf	11 utt2	A	so you have been playing,
	sd	12 utt1	B	but, I really enjoy it.

sd^e	13 utt2	A	actually, I don't even know if I checked that or not, to be perfectly honest. .
	b	14 utt1	B	Oh .

h	15 utt2	A	I don't know.
	bd	16 utt1	B	that's okay.

sd	17 utt6	A	I forget which one it was.
	b	18 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	19 utt1	A	It wound up tossing the ball into the trees, virtually every time.
	b	20 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	23 utt2	A	I was slicing, actually.
	b	24 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	25 utt1	A	And, as it turns out, I went and took some lessons for awhile, because I just, would lose so many balls, and, make it a horrible time for everybody.
	b	26 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	29 utt5	A	And I, And I still have this slice ,
	b	30 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	33 utt1	A	I'm a graduate student,
	bk	34 utt1	B	okay,

ny	35 utt1	A	Yes.
	ba	36 utt1	B	great.

sd	37 utt1	A	As a matter of fact, I don't have time to do much else, except for graduate work.
	b	38 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	39 utt2	A	so I hang around this way,
	b	40 utt1	B	Sure.

sd	41 utt2	A	a bunch of us were pretty avid golfers. Golfers, so we will go out
	b	42 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	43 utt2	A	and we will, we will play, you know.
	qy^d	44 utt1	B	And you don't, you don't have the length of the playing time that we do.

sd	47 utt3	A	when I go on vacation, my father and I, play a little bit.
	b	48 utt1	B	Yes.

sd	49 utt3	A	we play a par three, nine hole course.
	sd	50 utt1	B	that's my favorite kind to play.

b	53 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	54 utt2	B	and, in fact, I don't even like to use a driver,

b	57 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	58 utt1	B	And, I can just have better contact with the ball that way.

qy^g	63 utt1	A	But, those are, still not you favorite,
	nn	64 utt1	B	No,

ba	67 utt1	A	wow, .
	sd	68 utt1	B	One is,

sv	69 utt1	A	You must be very busy.
	aa	70 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	73 utt1	A	Miniature golf, there's my game.
	sv	74 utt1	B	Miniature golf is great,

sd	75 utt1	A	Miniature golf, there you go, putt, putt.
	sd	76 utt1	B	Well, that's the thing my kids like to do that you know, on dates and stuff.

sd	79 utt3	A	I don't recall anymore.
	b	80 utt1	B	Well, yeah,

sd	81 utt4	A	we had the,
	b	82 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	83 utt3	A	We have a very good one called Locust Hill though.
	br^m	84 utt1	B	Locust Hill?

sd	85 utt2	A	the L P G A comes here every year the Rochester International.
	b	86 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	87 utt2	A	And then we had a P G A, actually, a very big P G A, tour stop here, last year.
	ba	88 utt1	B	great.

sd	89 utt3	A	but, they say the course is, is, is pretty tough, pretty challenging.
	b	90 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	91 utt2	A	but, it's exceedingly well kept, apparently.
	ba	92 utt1	B	yeah.

sd	93 utt7	A	the grounds keepers were absolutely wonderful about, getting things back up again.
	ba	94 utt1	B	yeah.

sd	95 utt3	A	actually, when the, when the L P G A came here I guess that was about a week and a half ago, it, it takes over the whole town.
	b	96 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	99 utt2	A	and lots and lots of people take off work, to go to go an watch the, ladies , play.
	b	100 utt1	B	Yes.

sd	107 utt2	A	So, I mean, I think it's absolutely wonderful to see.
	aa	108 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	109 utt1	A	Yeah,
	sv	110 utt1	B	People are just cra ,

sd	111 utt4	A	and you sort of stink, like me,
	sv	112 utt1	B	Well, it's just such a difficult thing.

sv	113 utt1	A	and you sort of play every now and then.
	sd	114 utt2	B	I mean I just, I watch my husband

sd	117 utt3	A	And, And, and I can not, and I can not hit a golf ball .
	ba	118 utt1	B	my, really!

sd(^q)	125 utt1	A	That's because he's probably doing what I do, worrying about, is my head straight, is my arm right, is this correct, am I holding correctly, stuff like that. * slash error Yeah, / * slash error
	b	126 utt1	B	Yeah.

aa	131 utt2	A	yeah.
	sd	132 utt1	B	And I worry about that.

aa	133 utt1	A	yeah.
	sd	134 utt1	B	I have just got to get this drive, you know, really far,

b	137 utt1	A	Yeah.
	b	138 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	139 utt1	A	I have this nasty habit of turning my head at the last second, or, or just keeping my arm wrong.
	b	140 utt1	B	Yep,

qy	143 utt1	A	Is it?
	sv	144 utt2	B	And you are always so anxious to see where it goes.

aa	145 utt2	A	exactly.
	b	146 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	147 utt4	A	It took me a long time to learn to wait until the ball was in the air before I looked up.
	aa	148 utt1	B	Yeah,

^2	149 utt1	A	driver.
	sv	150 utt2	B	Because, those short irons, it's just, you want to look up cause you are getting close to the green

b	151 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	152 utt2	B	and you want to see it hit the green.

bf	153 utt1	A	Watch where it's going.
	b	154 utt1	B	Yeah,

bd	157 utt3	A	it's no big deal.
	sd	158 utt1	B	Well, when I,

sd^t	159 utt1	A	Both.
	b^m^t	160 utt1	B	Both.

sd^t	161 utt1	A	I believe so.
	b	162 utt1	B	Okay,

sd^t	163 utt2	A	I get a random reimbursement every now and then and don't really don't really figure it out, until afterward .
	b	164 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	169 utt1	A	really.
	sd^t	170 utt2	B	I just started yesterday.

sd^t	171 utt1	A	I have been doing this for awhile, actually.
	bh	172 utt1	B	Have you?

na	173 utt1	A	It seems like it's been a while.
	b	174 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd^t	175 utt1	A	And I just, get these random checks in the mail every now and then
	sd	176 utt1	B	I had a ,

sd^t	179 utt1	A	My wife and I both do it, as a matter of fact.
	bk	180 utt1	B	I see.

sd^t	181 utt2	A	and, To be honest, I really have not been accounting,
	b	182 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd^t	183 utt2	A	I just sort of figured, well, it's going to work.
	b	184 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	1 utt1	A	an interesting topic.
	aa	2 utt1	B	Yes.

b	5 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	6 utt2	B	I'm very much a fan of sports cars.

sv	7 utt2	A	Boy, you and my husband would have a whole lot in common .
	sd	12 utt4	B	I've avoided buying a new car for quite some time.

b	15 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	16 utt2	B	but if I was to buy one, probably something like a Miata.

bh	17 utt1	A	really.
	ny	18 utt1	B	Yeah

qw	19 utt2	A	how old is your car?
	sd	20 utt1	B	well I have a nineteen eighty five C R X.

b	21 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	22 utt1	B	which is, you know, it's,

b	23 utt2	A	Right.
	sd	24 utt1	B	But it's actually, it's kind of annoying cause I've got no reason to replace it .

qw	27 utt2	A	So what do the Miatas run?
	sd	28 utt2	B	they're about, thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and, you know, a bit more if you add some some options and so on

sv	29 utt1	A	Well, that's not too bad.
	aa	30 utt2	B	yeah,

sd	33 utt2	A	I've never driven one.
	sd	34 utt1	B	it's, it's nice.

br	35 utt1	A	Huh?
	sd	36 utt1	B	you know, about a minute or so. And, very twisty stuff.

b	37 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	38 utt2	B	And it handles so nicely.

qy^d	39 utt1	A	And so you've done this?
	ny	40 utt1	B	Yeah.

bk	41 utt2	A	Okay.
	b	42 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	43 utt1	A	Oh .
	sd	44 utt2	B	it's just so smooth

bh	45 utt1	A	Really?
	aa	46 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	47 utt1	A	Whatever my husband buys .
	b	48 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd^r	53 utt2	A	so it just, wasn't me, you know.
	b	54 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	55 utt1	A	And then, I'd want a minivan .
	o@	58 utt1	B	Okay, / * slash error should be bk

sd	59 utt1	A	Because I'm with the kids all the time.
	aa	60 utt1	B	yeah.

b	63 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	64 utt2	B	it's small enough that it's easy to drive.

sd	65 utt2	A	You pick up I pick up my little one from preschool
	sv	66 utt1	B	Holds a lot.

sd	67 utt2	A	and the whole parking lot's full of minivans.
	b	68 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	69 utt1	A	But, you know, I drive a little Subaru.
	b	70 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	71 utt4	A	but I just wanted to hold on to it cause I just really enjoy that.
	b	72 utt1	B	Right.

sd	73 utt1	A	And, that's really all I needed was for something just to go here and there and back.
	b	74 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	75 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	76 utt1	B	And, I've driven it a few times

b	79 utt1	A	really.
	sd	82 utt2	B	he used it,

sd	85 utt3	A	We went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan. And pulled the little trailer behind.
	b	86 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy	89 utt1	A	The pop up trailer?
	ny	90 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv^r	91 utt2	A	so it's really amazing how much a minivan can do.
	aa	92 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	93 utt2	A	they're not.
	b	94 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	97 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	98 utt1	B	You can take your choice of how expensive you want it to be.

sd	99 utt3	A	We do a lot of traveling. By car.
	b	100 utt1	B	Uh huh

sd	101 utt3	A	But it really didn't cause our kids are still little.
	b	102 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	103 utt2	A	Other than that, it got terrible mileage
	b	104 utt1	B	Yeah

b	107 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	108 utt1	B	Some of them probably even do thirty.

b	109 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	110 utt3	B	there's some other cars I'd like

sd^t	1 utt1	A	Here we go.
	aa	2 utt1	B	Okay,

sd^e	3 utt2	A	Two years ago I spent some Fourth of July to Labor Day on a jury that was, a change of venue from Columbus, Ohio for aggravated, murder and kidnapping.
	ba	4 utt1	B	Wow.

sd	5 utt2	A	it was quite a session that disrupted my whole summer, of course, five days a week,
	ba	6 utt1	B	Sounds like it.

sd	7 utt2	A	but it was an absolutely fascinating experience.
	ba	8 utt1	B	it sounds like it.

b	9 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	10 utt2	B	I think that the, trial by jury is a great idea at it's inception back two hundred years ago.

b	11 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv*	12 utt1	B	and it's just that I think they're just tieing up the, whole judicial process. / * typo > tying

sd	13 utt4	A	it was the first time in the state of Ohio that, D N A testing was entered as evidence.
	b	14 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	15 utt2	A	the judge was being especially careful that everything was done correctly so there couldn't be a mistrial of any kind.
	b	16 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	17 utt4	A	Actually it was fourteen because we had two alternates.
	ba	18 utt1	B	Jeez.

sd	19 utt1	A	And the judge was extremely concerned for our welfare, if we were comfortable, and, things of that nature which made us feel good.
	b	20 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	21 utt2	A	but the makeup of the jury, was truly you might say a cross section of a country.
	b	22 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	23 utt2	A	one was a former student of mine a few years before who was out of work.
	ba	24 utt1	B	Gee.

sd	25 utt5	A	So, we had quite a cross section of black, white and women and men.
	b	26 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	27 utt4	A	and I thought that that was a failing because, from the standpoint that it was difficult to try to remember everything,
	b	28 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	29 utt2	A	and he was right, there also.
	b	30 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv,o@	31 utt3	A	I think it depends upon how the judge handles the case, and if the criminal chooses to have a a three judge panel I should say, I think he can, * Seems that a 2nd slash unit should begin at "and if the criminal . . ." have that rather than trial by jury.
	b	32 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	35 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	36 utt1	B	And, I went to court

qy^d	37 utt1	A	You're kidding.
	nn	38 utt1	B	No.

sv	39 utt2	A	and money.
	aa	40 utt1	B	Yes,

sv	43 utt4	A	but I also feel, as you said, that the original concept of the jury as it was originally setup, back, a hundred years ago was fine but that it needs to be more refined for today's standard of living and the, level of education of so many people now,
	b	44 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	45 utt4	A	and then he wasn't selected on the jury.
	ba	46 utt1	B	my God.

sd	47 utt3	A	And, you know, some of it just seemed rather extreme.
	aa	48 utt1	B	Yes.

b	51 utt1	A	Right.
	sv	52 utt1	B	I mean, some things are just so cut and dry.

sv	55 utt2	A	well, I guess he'd have to be careful with entrapment or some of those things,
	aa	56 utt1	B	Yes.

sd	57 utt2	A	I assume you have seen on television recently, as probably the whole country has, the beating of the man in Los Angeles.
	sv	58 utt1	B	that was horrible.

sv	61 utt3	A	and it's just a stroke of luck, that someone was able to get it on tape and then, to listen to the tape recording, at the police station of the whole conversation afterwards.
	b	62 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	65 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	66 utt2	B	And, you know, if you beat a dog like that, they'll put you, in jail, you know.

sd	69 utt1	A	Well, we get a few other case, like up at the end of last year where one police officer, it was on a drug raid, was trying to extricate, a confession or information from a drug dealer and did so by placing a hot iron on his bare chest, burned him.
	ba	72 utt1	B	Jeez.

sd	73 utt4	A	and then last week someone shot and killed the former policeman.
	b	74 utt1	B	Huh.

sv	75 utt4	A	and we just need more discipline country wide.
	aa	76 utt1	B	Yes,

fc^t	81 utt2	A	and, good luck on calls.
	fc	82 utt1	B	Okay,

fc	83 utt2	A	Bye bye.
	fc	84 utt1	B	Bye bye.

qw	1 utt1	A	What are your favorite T V shows?
	sd	2 utt1	B	I guess one of my favorite ones is CHEERS.

b	3 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	4 utt1	B	I always liked that one.

b	7 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	8 utt1	B	Those are probably my two favorites.

sd	9 utt3	A	My wife and I both like COMMISH.
	sd	10 utt1	B	You know, I've watched that one time

sd	13 utt3	A	around here at least.
	b	14 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	15 utt1	A	I guess it depends on what channel you're getting. You know, what system you're getting it through.
	b	18 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	21 utt2	A	it seems to be kind of halfway between, something like ALL IN THE FAMILY and, HILL STREET BLUES.
	b	22 utt1	B	Yeah

sv	23 utt2	A	it's a good show.
	aa	24 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	29 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	30 utt1	B	And he seems to do that sometimes .

sv	31 utt2	A	he's tender hearted fellow.
	aa	32 utt1	B	Yeah

sd	33 utt2	A	I think that's what first drew us to him, the, the relationship between he and his wife kind of looks a lot like ours.
	b	34 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	37 utt2	A	 Yeah,
	sd	38 utt1	B	I always like,

sd	39 utt2	A	I know we watch COMMISH any chance we get.
	b	40 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	41 utt3	A	it's gotten more and more to where they are so totally against, anything spiritual.
	b	42 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	45 utt2	A	I used to be a real big fan of STAR TREK.
	qy^g	46 utt1	B	Used to be a Trekie, huh ?

ny	47 utt1	A	pretty much, yeah.
	b	48 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	49 utt1	A	I always enjoyed the show anyway .
	b	50 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	51 utt1	A	And STAR TREK's in a s , or the, STAR WARS set
	b	52 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy^d	53 utt1	A	one of the first STAR WARS movie?
	ny	54 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	55 utt1	A	I think I watched it like nineteen times.
	ba	56 utt1	B	my goodness.

sd	59 utt1	A	Anyway, I was a pretty big fan of that sort of thing.
	ba	60 utt1	B	Wow .

sd	63 utt1	A	used to read a lot of science fiction work, too.
	b	64 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	65 utt4	A	but I don't know if you heard them or not, I got a twelve year old, twelve week old baby.
	b^m,sd,o@	66 utt1	B	Twelve week, I was going to say, I hear a baby in the background . / * B.66 and 68 2 slash units?

sd	69 utt3	A	between that and school it's not ,
	sv	70 utt1	B	I imagine that keeps you busy .

sd	73 utt1	A	Between him and school, there's not much time left for watching much T V.
	b	74 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	77 utt3	A	And we're both full time students
	ba	78 utt1	B	wow.

b	79 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	80 utt1	B	That must be tough.

qr	81 utt1	A	What are you hoping for, a boy or a girl?
	sd	82 utt1	B	It doesn't matter, just a healthy baby.

sv,qy^g@	83 utt1	A	that's, that's the best way, you haven't found out yet or anything, have you? / * Looks like this should be 2 slash units, with their respective labels shown here.
	na	84 utt1	B	Well, we had a sonogram,

sv^r	87 utt1	A	That's the best way.
	b	88 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	89 utt2	A	I mean, you know, It's not as much fun.
	aa	90 utt1	B	Yeah

sd	97 utt1	A	I'm about half kid at heart anyway.
	sd	98 utt1	B	I am, too.

sv	101 utt3	A	well, a couple of the, ones Disney's doing aren't too bad
	sv	102 utt1	B	Well, you know, it seems like a lot of them are a lot more violent than they used to be.

aa	103 utt1	A	yeah.
	sd	104 utt1	B	You know, I remember, like, the FLINTSTONES and the JETSONS

sv	107 utt1	A	the, the worst of the violence in the FLINTSTONES was when somebody gave Fred a poke in the snoot.
	b	108 utt1	B	Yeah

sv	109 utt1	A	But, shoot, I mean, blowing up galaxies and and putting a curse on the whole planet, or, or you know, on you know, everything of this species, you know, just all kinds of crud .
	b	110 utt1	B	Yep.

sv	113 utt2	A	everything's mutations and and killing
	b	114 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	115 utt2	A	and, Gone are the days of those things they use ,
	b	116 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	117 utt2	A	what was it T N, Turner Broadcasting Network used to, do the Saturday morning and Sunday morning cartoons, the old cartoons. They used to put between the first and second feature at the theatre.
	b	118 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	119 utt1	A	Those old little ten minute jobs where, the real ballooned looking art work, you know
	b	120 utt1	B	Uh huh.

fa	1 utt2	A	I'm sorry,
	sd	2 utt1	B	Ready to go.

sd	3 utt3	A	We take, you know, the DALLAS MORNING NEWS daily, and the Plano paper daily
	b	4 utt1	B	Right.

sd	5 utt2	A	and, you know, after a month of that you got a ton, of newspapers.
	sd	8 utt1	B	I know it builds up really fast.

aa	9 utt1	A	It really does,
	b	10 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	11 utt1	A	I do recycle, newspapers and, glass.
	b	12 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	15 utt4	A	so we don't have, you know, six thousand plastic milk jugs, a month, you know.
	b	16 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	19 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	20 utt2	B	and, so it really builds up with us.

sd	23 utt1	A	But you know there is a place you can take those also you know at the same place just put them in a different, container.
	b	24 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	25 utt3	A	the city is going to leave, receptacles at people's home.
	b	26 utt1	B	yeah,

aa	29 utt1	A	It, certainly would
	b	30 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	31 utt3	A	and then the, you know, trash guys will pick it up. Which would really be handy, you know, for people like shut ins, or, people who can't or don't drive, you know,
	b	32 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	37 utt1	A	they can't get to the these centers.
	aa	38 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	39 utt1	A	And I'm sure rather than try to, ask someone to take them for them they probably just pitch them, you know?
	b	40 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	41 utt1	A	But I think that's probably a good idea.
	sd	42 utt1	B	They used to have several places, that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all,

b	43 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	44 utt1	B	and they stopped doing it because they said it wasn't profitable.

b	45 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	46 utt1	B	So finally, the people put so much pressure on the city,

b	47 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	48 utt1	B	they did a survey of everybody,

b	49 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	50 utt1	B	and they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic, and put it in front of the Wal Mart store in town,

b	53 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	54 utt1	B	and they, it just really,

aa	55 utt1	A	That's right.
	sd	56 utt1	B	and so Wal Mart complained ,

b	57 utt2	A	yes.
	sd	58 utt1	B	so they moved it behind the store

b	59 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	60 utt1	B	and so people kept piling stuff in the same place, where it used to be.

ba	63 utt1	A	Great .
	sd	64 utt1	B	it was just like a dump there,

ba	65 utt1	A	I bet it was.
	sd	66 utt1	B	and so finally, you know, I called

b	67 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	68 utt1	B	So we do that because we have milk cartons, you know, constantly, with two little kids, and the paper,

b	71 utt1	A	Sure.
	sd	72 utt2	B	but it just builds up,

b	73 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	74 utt1	B	it would be so nice if they had it, you know at your home, where you could just turn it in so they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area , in one neighborhood,

b	79 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	80 utt1	B	and they have pickup there,

b	81 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	82 utt1	B	And the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out

b	83 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	84 utt1	B	but then finally people started getting the message.

sv	85 utt2	A	It's just a matter of education, I think.
	aa	86 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	87 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	88 utt3	B	I think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this,

b	89 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	90 utt1	B	and it's not going to be,

b	91 utt1	A	Yeah,
	sv	92 utt1	B	I don't think .

aa	93 utt2	A	that's right.
	b	94 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	95 utt2	A	I hope it works.
	aa	96 utt1	B	Yeah,

aa^r	99 utt1	A	absolutely.
	sd	100 utt1	B	I know this year we took our Christmas tree

b	101 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	102 utt2	B	and they gave you a little, seedling to plant, you know ,

b	105 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	106 utt1	B	you could take the mulch home with you, you know, and take buckets of that home,

b	107 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	108 utt1	B	so that was really good idea,

b	109 utt1	A	Sure.
	sd	110 utt1	B	I thought.

sd	111 utt3	A	and it's amazing how much stuff just the two of us generate,
	b	112 utt1	B	Yeah

sd	113 utt1	A	you know, I can imagine a family of, you know, four or five.
	aa	114 utt1	B	yeah

aa	115 utt1	A	It really does.
	b	116 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	117 utt2	A	I really hadn't thought about it to tell you the truth.
	b	118 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	121 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	122 utt1	B	I've read so many different things about diapers

b	123 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	124 utt1	B	but now their saying that they're, really not that much in comparison to the others because you don't have to use the water to wash them, and, you know, all different kinds of things too,

aa	125 utt1	A	That's right.
	sd	126 utt2	B	so the diaper service, trucks

b	129 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	130 utt1	B	So I don't know what's the, you know, right thing to do

b	131 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	132 utt1	B	but the landfill have to do something special, you know, for those,

b	133 utt1	A	I see.
	sd	134 utt1	B	but that just generates a tremendous of volume of trash too,

sd	135 utt3	A	you know I'm not personally involved because you know, I don't have any children that wear diapers,
	b	136 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	137 utt1	A	but I'm sure it creates a large amount of, you know, refuse.
	aa	138 utt1	B	It does,

aa	143 utt1	A	That's right.
	sv	144 utt1	B	because you hate to contribute to the problem,

aa	145 utt1	A	Absolutely.
	sv	146 utt1	B	but on the on the other hand the alternatives aren't to great either .

aa^r	149 utt1	A	absolutely.
	b	150 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	151 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	152 utt2	B	I don't know if those are recyclable

sd	155 utt2	A	there is a receptacle, you know, at the centers also for aluminum,
	b	156 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	157 utt1	A	but again we don't generate that much
	b	158 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	159 utt1	A	we don't,
	sd	160 utt1	B	we don't either,

b	161 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	162 utt1	B	we usually use frozen vegetables and things

sd	165 utt2	A	ninety nine percent of ours is newspaper and, you know, glass.
	b	166 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	173 utt1	A	Car batteries.
	b	174 utt1	B	Yeah

b	175 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	b	176 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	179 utt1	A	so I don't, don't have that problem.
	b	180 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	181 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	182 utt1	B	we try to recycle old clothes .

sd*	183 utt3	A	well we do to as a matter of fact. / * typo too
	sd	184 utt1	B	Our church has a place, where you can take them

b	185 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	186 utt2	B	and they, you know, pass them on to, other families,

sd	189 utt2	A	we have one of those in town.
	b	190 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	191 utt2	A	one of their major fund raisers is, you know, a garage sale.
	b	192 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	193 utt3	A	it's called the Clothes Closet,
	b	194 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	195 utt1	A	that's what it's called here in Plano.
	bf@	196 utt1	B	Kind of like a Goodwill, / * should this really be the end of a slash unit? B's next utterance is left hanging as a result

aa	197 utt1	A	Right.
	bf@	198 utt1	B	kind of place. / *' if previous B utterance is "de slashed"

aa	199 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	b	200 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	201 utt1	A	And they distribute them to the people, that need them.
	b	202 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	207 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	208 utt1	B	Well, I'm not sure I can't really think of anything else that we could recycle.

sd	209 utt2	A	I can't either ,
	b	210 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd^r	211 utt3	A	I really can't either.
	b	212 utt1	B	Okay.

fc	213 utt2	A	well, it was nice talking to you.
	fc	214 utt1	B	You to.

fc	217 utt2	A	Bye bye.
	fc	218 utt1	B	Bye bye. .

sd	1 utt4	A	since living in Dallas it's always so hot, in the summertime, I just, wear lots of shorts, because I don't work during the day.
	b	2 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy	3 utt1	A	So, do you work?
	ny	4 utt1	B	Yes,

b	5 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	6 utt2	B	but I work at a manufacturing plant,

b	9 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	10 utt1	B	But occasionally I have to get dressed up and wear panty hose and a dress, and high heel shoes

b	11 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	12 utt2	B	and I feel really uncomfortable doing that

b	15 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	16 utt1	B	But, normally I just wear blue jeans and a T shirt.

b	17 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	18 utt1	B	Very, very, comfortable.

sd	19 utt5	A	so, you know, I just wear you know, my shorts and stuff like that.
	b	20 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	21 utt2	A	I don't go out and spend lots of money on, different, you know, suits and stuff, you know.
	b	22 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	23 utt3	A	so you know, I had more suits and stuff then
	b	24 utt1	B	Right .

sd	25 utt1	A	Worry about all that kind of stuff .
	sd	26 utt1	B	Well, I have plenty of suits and dress clothes because I'm like you, when I first started working, I have all these suits and blouses and skirts and mix and match, and that kind of stuff ,

b	29 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	30 utt1	B	but now that I, you know, work in the manufacturing plant, then it's just, so much more difficult for me to actually get dressed up to come in to work like that.

b	31 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	32 utt1	B	but occasionally I have to because, part of my job is teaching, and training,

b	33 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	34 utt2	B	and, so you have to look just a little bit nicer than your normal, garb .

b	37 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd^r	38 utt1	B	Than your normal garb .

bf	39 utt2	A	moved from, Winter.
	sd	40 utt1	B	and I had mostly polyesters and, wools and winter clothes and buying all these cotton clothes,

b	43 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	44 utt2	B	and then, of course, you have to iron them all the time.

b	45 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	46 utt2	B	that's been a problem for me.

sd	47 utt4	A	and, You know, I've got all these clothes that I never wear, because you can't wear them here.
	aa	50 utt1	B	Right.

sd	53 utt2	A	You have so much summer.
	b	54 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	55 utt1	A	And, so then when you know, I finally get a chance to go out with my husband it's like a real chore to find something nice to wear .
	aa	56 utt1	B	That's true, that's true.

b	57 utt1	A	Yeah .
	sd	58 utt1	B	Well, I know, I was just now, putting away a lot of my winter clothes,

b	59 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	60 utt1	B	and I was going through here

b	61 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	62 utt1	B	And, because it's a wool skirt

b	63 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	64 utt1	B	And I have five or six wool skirts,

b	65 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	66 utt1	B	so I was thinking well, maybe, you know, I need to think about getting rid of them,

bf	67 utt2	A	You hate to get rid of it, because you know how much you spent on them.
	aa	68 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	69 utt1	A	And it's real hard to get rid of some of that stuff, I know.
	aa,o@	70 utt1	B	I know, I agree with you . / * 2 slash units?

b	73 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	74 utt1	B	But the previous winter we had more, cold weather where I was able to actually wear, your double and triple layerings of, clothes yeah, like you would when you're up north.

b	77 utt2	A	yeah.
	sv	78 utt2	B	So , that's really interesting.

sd	81 utt4	A	right now my clothes come from Target, you know .
	aa	82 utt1	B	Yes,

sd	83 utt4	A	and they're wadded up in a ball.
	aa	84 utt1	B	Yes,

sd	87 utt1	A	I'm so glad to meet somebody that their iron board is their permanent fixture in their house.
	sd	88 utt1	B	It is, it is.

sd	91 utt1	A	but my ironing board is part of my decor
	aa	92 utt1	B	That's true,

b	93 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	94 utt2	B	and then you can actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall, you know, to have it, permanently attached,

b	95 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	96 utt2	B	and that's what I'm thinking I'm going to have to do because mine's sitting right out in front of my bedroom

sd(^q)	99 utt3	A	but it's like, I just don't want to do it ,
	aa	100 utt1	B	Uh uh,

b	101 utt1	A	Yeah.
	o	102 utt1	B	No.

b	103 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	104 utt2	B	and I wouldn't have to have that eyesore .

ba	105 utt2	A	, that's an idea.
	b	106 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	107 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	108 utt1	B	So, I have a big closet.

sd	109 utt4	A	if I know I'm having somebody come over to the house and there's a possibility they might be going back into my room, I will put it away,
	b	110 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	113 utt1	A	but I iron our clothes as we go along,
	b	114 utt1	B	Uh huh.

aa	117 utt2	A	no.
	sd	118 utt2	B	and I'm like you, the night before or that day, I will iron whatever it is that we need

b	119 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	120 utt2	B	and that's it.

b	121 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	122 utt1	B	Because it's too many,

bf	123 utt2	A	You can't iron it all
	b	124 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	125 utt3	A	they can't decide what they want to wear so they, change their minds, you know, I know, I mean my oldest is only four,
	b	126 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	127 utt2	A	but she's still changes her mind two or three times, before she figures out what she's going to wear
	b	128 utt1	B	Right.

sd	131 utt1	A	And then they never put anything back.
	aa	132 utt1	B	No,

sv(^q)@	135 utt2	A	that, that's called smart, you know, we don't do that kind of stuff, you know. * Seems this should end in a slash That's called too easy on mom. / * See note above; this would seem to be an indep. slash unit

sd	89 utt2	A	or we'll, you know, put it out on the grill so that, the bulk of the tallow will dribble off of it.
	b	90 utt1	B	Uh huh,

b	95 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	96 utt1	B	Chili.

sv^r	99 utt1	A	Deer spaghetti is real good.
	aa	100 utt1	B	Uh huh

sd	101 utt2	A	I think if I was going to have a dinner party, I'd probably have, sandwiches or something along those lines and then, you know, just something light finger food sort of something or, Or maybe have something roasting out on the fire.
	b	102 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	111 utt1	A	Usually it's, one other couple come over for a dinner.
	b	114 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	115 utt3	A	we had a turkey loaf.
	b	116 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	121 utt1	A	scalloped potatoes.
	b	122 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	123 utt2	A	mashed potatoes.
	b	124 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	125 utt1	A	Mashed potatoes with, cheese melted over the top of them.
	o@	126 utt1	B	* slash error sounds good. / * slash error

aa	129 utt1	A	Yeah,
	sd	130 utt1	B	This isn't a good topic for me right now.

sd	135 utt1	A	I've been fighting my weight since I was about ten years old.
	aa	136 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	1 utt7	A	but I just feel that ,
	sd	2 utt1	B	Well I don't know how much publicity it's gotten outside of the state

b	3 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	4 utt2	B	to be honest, I didn't pay that much attention, to the details of it.

b	7 utt1	A	Uh huh
	sd	8 utt1	B	the big disagreement I have is that in California, the appeals process, is so extensive and takes so long that you end up spending a huge amount of money in like ten to fifteen years before you can actually, you know, put somebody to death for, for a crime.

sv	9 utt3	A	that is a consequence,
	sv	10 utt1	B	And, I mean, that's ridiculous.

b	15 utt1	A	Right.
	sv	16 utt2	B	and you should be able to either put the guy to death

sv	21 utt1	A	Well maybe that's something that needs to be worked on.
	b	22 utt1	B	Yeah.

qy	23 utt4	A	was that the man that claimed he was abused
	ny	24 utt1	B	Yeah,

ba	29 utt1	A	yeah.
	sd	30 utt2	B	and so he wasn't, you know, mentally competent or anything else. Which is ridiculous,

b	31 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	34 utt1	B	and the court found him competent,

qw	37 utt2	A	How long was that?
	sd	38 utt1	B	I forget.

ba	39 utt2	A	Boy.
	sv	40 utt1	B	it was something really outrageous.

sd	41 utt4	A	You know, it's not used that often you know. At least here in Texas
	b	42 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	43 utt3	A	I really do .
	sv	44 utt1	B	I think in general, punishment in the United States is a lot weaker than it should be.

b	45 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	46 utt2	B	I mean there's no connection between the two.

aa^r	47 utt2	A	right.
	sd	48 utt1	B	I mean you take you know, most of the people who are committing violent crimes, most of them, not all by any means,

b	49 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	50 utt1	B	they don't really see past next week much less next year.

b	51 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd(^q)	52 utt1	B	And to say, you know, well if I kill somebody then a decade from now, I might face the punishment.

b	53 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	54 utt1	B	That's not real.

sd	55 utt1	A	My sister and I were wondering about this recently because an old friend of ours in California, this happened about a week ago.
	b	58 utt1	B	Uh huh.

h	59 utt4	A	I don't know .
	qy	60 utt1	B	you mean, would he be put to death for that?

na	61 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	62 utt1	B	largely depends on the circumstances

aa	63 utt1	A	I think you're right.
	sd	64 utt1	B	if they can say things like, you know, well he was just, you know, temporarily insane because of, some domestic squabble then you know, they'll give him, you know, twenty years with parole in twelve or something like that .

aa	2 utt1	A	Yes.
	sd	3 utt1	B	that's, that's the state that was famous when they executed somebody.

sd	4 utt1	A	Gary Gilmore.
	b^m	5 utt1	B	Gary Gilmore.

b	6 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	7 utt1	B	By firing squad, as I recall.

sd	8 utt2	A	and we still have a death penalty.
	b	9 utt1	B	Uh huh

sd	10 utt3	A	I guess we have the longest, running inmates for death row too.
	b	11 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	12 utt1	A	And then we had another guy, Ronald Lafferty, that thought God told him to kill his sister in law.
	b	13 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	14 utt1	A	He just got a new trial because, the judge felt that he was incompetent.
	b	17 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qo	18 utt1	A	how do you feel about the death penalty?
	sd	19 utt2	B	until recently I've been sort of,

b	20 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	21 utt2	B	I assume they're doing it for that reason .

sv	22 utt1	A	Well, I'm sure that's .
	sv(^q)	23 utt1	B	by by saying well, doing th , this particular crime in this particular way is a capital crime now.

sv	28 utt2	A	but, terrorism definitely. And selling out your country.
	b	31 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	34 utt2	A	it's got to be something that is going to cost them, because we never lock anybody up forever.
	aap	35 utt1	B	Not often.

sd	36 utt2	A	We've got these guys in New York that, I'm sure you heard about, the ones that killed, the gentleman that came from Utah to watch the tennis people.
	b	37 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	40 utt1	A	And I guess they got convicted, the four, of murder.
	b	41 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy^d	44 utt1	A	So you've come to a definite opinion on it now?
	sv	45 utt3	B	it seems like it's gotten carried away,

bf	46 utt2	A	You kind of hate to,
	o	47 utt1	B	No,

qy	48 utt1	A	You mean violence?
	qy	51 utt2	B	yeah, I mean, doesn't this encourage murder, in order to wipe out the the witnesses?

sv	54 utt3	A	I think that people who, infringe on other people's rights, and screw up their whole lives with rape, child molesting, terrorism, just
	b	55 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	56 utt2	A	but I'm for it for certain reasons.
	b	57 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	58 utt1	A	And I think that things like rape, you can't get over, it takes a lifetime.
	b	59 utt1	B	I see,

nd	60 utt1	A	if it was, Yeah.
	sd	61 utt1	B	A six person jury could have decided either way, of course .

sv	62 utt4	A	and, if they're habitual, like three times caught for rape or child molesting then snuff them.
	b	63 utt1	B	Uh huh.

br	66 utt1	A	Pardon?
	sv^r	67 utt1	B	The problem there is that they've been let out jail.

sv	68 utt4	A	That isn't a place of rehabilitation.
	b	69 utt1	B	Yeah,

qy^g	72 utt2	A	it's a tough question, isn't it, on whether, at what point do they become so detrimental to society that society can't afford to keep them around to keep giving them chances.
	ny	73 utt1	B	Uh huh.

o	1 utt1	A	Set.
	b	2 utt1	B	Okay.

qy^g^t	3 utt1	A	you got the topic, right?
	ny	4 utt1	B	Yeah.

qw	5 utt2	A	well, where in Dallas are you?
	sd	6 utt1	B	I'm in Richardson.

qy	7 utt2	A	So you do recycling there?
	ny	8 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	9 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	10 utt1	B	And they also have a couple of areas where you can take, cans, plastic and paper, to, you know, dump them off there if you don't, want to wait and have a pick up, least of paper,

qy	13 utt2	A	do you know?
	no	14 utt1	B	I'm not sure.

b	15 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	qo	18 utt1	B	What about you?

sd	19 utt1	A	Well, I'm in Dallas proper in the city of Dallas
	b	20 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	23 utt1	A	So they're not picking up anything .
	b	24 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	25 utt2	A	We've got all these boxes in our garage for, you know, green glass and clear glass and plastic and everything.
	qw	26 utt1	B	Where do you take them?

sd	29 utt1	A	there's a lot of places to take, like the plastic, shopping bags like most of the grocery stores.
	b	30 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	39 utt4	A	You know, it would still be more convenient than what we have now.
	sd	40 utt1	B	One of the people from my department, I think used to take a lot of the stuff to a recycling center that was for the benefit of the Dallas Shelter.

qw	43 utt1	A	Where is that?
	sd	44 utt2	B	she's not here anymore

sd	47 utt2	A	I'm, I'm, I'm just, I'm north of Addison actually.
	b	48 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	49 utt1	A	So I'm really
	b	50 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	51 utt1	A	s , I'm in Dallas, but only technically .
	sd	52 utt1	B	Well, sometimes we always keep our aluminum cans.

b	55 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	56 utt1	B	And a lot of times they take them over to one of these can banks.

sd	57 utt2	A	I've seen those.
	sd	58 utt1	B	You don't get too much money back.

b	59 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	60 utt1	B	But normally I collect, like three trash bags full

b	61 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	62 utt1	B	and I take them over to that can bank

sv	65 utt1	A	Well, you get something .
	b	68 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	69 utt2	A	but, again, that's another stop
	b	70 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	71 utt3	A	and so hopefully they'll do it soon.
	b	72 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	73 utt2	A	That would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week
	b	74 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	75 utt6	A	that would be great.
	b	76 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	79 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	80 utt2	B	and like sometimes they come by,

b	81 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	82 utt1	B	I'm not really sure why they're not always consistent in that.

b	85 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	86 utt2	B	That would be easy.

qrr	87 utt3	A	or do they take the whole thing?
	sd	88 utt1	B	You're not supposed to have, like the coupons in there.

bk	89 utt1	A	okay.
	sd	90 utt1	B	or you're not supposed to put magazines in there

b	91 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	92 utt1	B	and you can't take newspapers.

^g	95 utt2	A	right?
	ny	96 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	99 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	100 utt1	B	You know, well, that's stupid

b	103 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	104 utt1	B	There was like a lot of paper coming out of our department that wasn't recyclable.

b	105 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	106 utt1	B	So I thought that was pretty good to expand upon it,

sd	107 utt1	A	Well, and they take cans, now, too. Which is great.
	b	108 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	111 utt2	A	And, In fact this past year, we got all of our money for the Christmas tree because we saved cans for the entire year.
	b	112 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	115 utt1	A	And it worked out really well.
	sd	116 utt1	B	Well, we had the one person who used to take things to the Dallas Shelter.

b	117 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	118 utt1	B	I think that's what that was called.

b	119 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	120 utt1	B	she used to collect from the whole department,

b	121 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	122 utt1	B	I wish I could remember the whole name of that place,

b	123 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	124 utt2	B	she used to collect them from everybody in the department.

b	125 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	126 utt1	B	She'd go up and down with her little bag collecting from everybody.

qy	1 utt2	A	you got any hobbies that you want to talk about?
	sd	2 utt1	B	Well, I, don't seem to have as much spare time as I used to,

qw	3 utt1	A	What in the world do you do with your computer that takes so much time?
	sd	4 utt1	B	Well, I sit and design cards

bh	5 utt1	A	really?
	sd	6 utt1	B	and, I'm really into graphics,

b	11 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	12 utt1	B	and, it's just getting going.

ba	17 utt1	A	that's good.
	bd	18 utt1	B	Well, I guess .

b	21 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	22 utt1	B	and, it's really a challenge,

sd	23 utt1	A	Well, I, play trombone in the Plano Community Band.
	ba	24 utt1	B	neat.

sd	25 utt1	A	And I, like to do a lot of bicycling when the weather allows, and during summer when there's daylight savings time's when I get out and bike.
	sd	26 utt1	B	Well, I hope you all had as pretty a day today as we did.

sd	27 utt1	A	Well, it wasn't too bad, other than the Cowboys didn't do so hot.
	aa	28 utt1	B	well now, yes .

sv	31 utt3	A	the Lions are pretty good, I'm afraid, a lot better team than the Cowboys were today.
	o	32 utt1	B	On any given day, they say.

sd	35 utt5	A	but I always go back to it .
	sd	36 utt1	B	I take spells,

ba	37 utt1	A	I understand that.
	sd	38 utt1	B	and then I get burned out on it.

sv	39 utt1	A	Well, you do lots of stuff.
	sd	40 utt1	B	Well, it doesn't seem like I get anything done,

sd	45 utt4	A	I cover Texas and Oklahoma.
	bk	46 utt1	B	okay.

sd	47 utt2	A	I got customers in Oklahoma City and Tulsa and Perry, Oklahoma and Eda and all that way.
	ba	48 utt1	B	how neat.

sd	51 utt4	A	about thirty three thousand miles a year.
	sv	52 utt1	B	well that doesn't leave a lot of time for hobbies,

sd	53 utt7	A	so that isn't too bad.
	qw	54 utt1	B	How big is your band?

sd	55 utt4	A	but we only average about forty to fifty people you know, usually.
	ba	56 utt1	B	Ooh.

aa	59 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	60 utt1	B	It's not like there are four or five of you there.

sd	61 utt14	A	It's fun.
	sd	62 utt1	B	I have absolutely no musical ability whatsoever,

sd	63 utt3	A	I sing in a church choir on Wednesday nights when I'm around, and play in the band on Monday nights, and keeps you out of trouble that way.
	sd	64 utt1	B	Well, I'm probably one of the few people that the,

sd^t	1 utt2	A	Jerry, the topic was favorite T V shows, and what kind are you interested in, and how they, and do they differ from like mine.
	b	2 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	5 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	6 utt2	B	Now I do watch the Discover channel and some on channel thirteen

sd	9 utt3	A	I'm sort of a movie buff.
	b	10 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	11 utt3	A	and a lot of times I will, go out and take a lunch hour, go to lunch from like twelve to two, go to a movie and just come back to my office.
	ba	12 utt1	B	I don't blame you.

sd	13 utt3	A	and I'm pretty much of a junk movie watcher by myself.
	b	14 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	15 utt1	A	If I take my wife, then we see something a little nicer, you know.
	b	16 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	17 utt9	A	and I'll turn on the tube set there and have my coffee or Coke or whatever and a little T V
	b	18 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	19 utt2	A	and sometimes I set there all evening.
	b	20 utt1	B	Yeah

ba^r	21 utt2	A	you bet.
	sd	22 utt1	B	And, because they're, they're, you know, they're documentaries and they're.

sv	23 utt1	A	Well, that's an interesting channel.
	aa	24 utt1	B	you bet,

sd	27 utt2	A	and, you know I like my sports and everything
	b	28 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	33 utt3	A	and I left at halftime
	sd	34 utt1	B	Well, they, who , they whooped up on them.

sv	37 utt2	A	They just did an excellent job.
	b	38 utt1	B	Uh huh,

b^m	39 utt2	A	the Eagles
	sd	40 utt1	B	I did.

sv	41 utt2	A	luck into it now, I think.
	aa	42 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	43 utt1	A	Cowboys, they earned it on their own merit.
	sd	44 utt1	B	Did you know, everybody, or not everybody but quite a few of the folks were kind of down on Mister Johnson,

sd	45 utt2	A	as much as everyone, you know, used the word, love Tom Landry, I'm glad that Jimmy Johnson's there.
	b	46 utt1	B	Uh huh,

aa	47 utt1	A	It was.
	sv	48 utt1	B	And I think Tom knew it.

sv	51 utt2	A	I think he would have stayed there four or five more years until he could have gone out
	aa	52 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	53 utt2	A	it's, you know he earned his stripes.
	b	56 utt1	B	yeah,

sv	61 utt2	A	he's a winner in anyone's book
	b	62 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	63 utt1	A	and I hope he's a winner in his own book, you know because that's the key there.
	sv	64 utt1	B	he is,

sv	69 utt3	A	but, you know, this ring of honor thing, you know, he needs to be there because he's earned it.
	b	70 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	71 utt4	A	and he won't do that yet.
	b	72 utt1	B	Yes.

sd	73 utt2	A	So. I hope he makes up his mind to do it, because he needs to be remembered.
	sv	74 utt1	B	he will.

aa^r	77 utt3	A	no.
	o	78 utt1	B	Shoot, come now .

h	81 utt2	A	let's put it that way.
	aa	82 utt1	B	you betcha.

sd	83 utt3	A	and I feel like a native.
	^h	84 utt1	B	Well, let's see,

bh	85 utt1	A	did you.
	ny	86 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	87 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	88 utt1	B	So, I haven't looked back yet either,

sd	89 utt1	A	we came down from New York state in seventy four, and never had any regrets at all.
	aa	90 utt1	B	Right.

sd	91 utt2	A	It's been.
	ad	92 utt1	B	and then look at the weather we have down here.

sd	93 utt2	A	and I've got my last kid graduating from college this next December
	b	94 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	95 utt1	A	she's getting married the month before in November,
	ba	96 utt1	B	goodness.

sd	97 utt1	A	I will be finished with that.
	sd	98 utt1	B	Well, we're well, we're finished with all but the last one, and trying to get him through his technical school

b	101 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	102 utt1	B	and, he's over halfway,

ba	103 utt1	A	Well, good.
	sd^t	104 utt1	B	You know, we're not staying on the topic of television shows,

sd^e	105 utt2	A	not at all.
	aa	106 utt1	B	No,

sd^t	1 utt2	A	I guess tonight's subject is to discuss current events and how we keep up on current events, and if we're satisfied with the, coverage that we receive.
	aa	2 utt1	B	Right.

qo	7 utt4	A	how about yourself?
	sd	8 utt1	B	Well, I'm like you.

b	11 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	12 utt2	B	whatever I'm doing, I watch that.

b^r	13 utt2	A	right.
	sd	14 utt1	B	so I get it from T V a lot.

bk	15 utt2	A	Okay.
	sd	16 utt1	B	And, The thing about it, you know, now that I've found, is that we get such good coverage on T V, or at least such, I don't know, attempted thoroughness of coverage, by the time you get the TIME MAGAZINE, there's nothing in it you don't know.

qy^g	23 utt1	A	It's historic events, huh.
	na	24 utt1	B	Right.

bk	25 utt1	A	okay.
	sv	26 utt1	B	You know, it's, basically you've heard everything

aa	27 utt1	A	Yes.
	sv	28 utt1	B	and, you might get a little more thorough, account of something,

b	29 utt1	A	Yeah.
	h	30 utt1	B	I would say.

sv	31 utt8	A	And it'd be refreshing once in a while to hear some good news.
	b	32 utt1	B	Right

sv	35 utt2	A	we do.
	sv	36 utt2	B	I think our concept of news isn't necessarily events that happen.

aa^r	37 utt2	A	true.
	sv	38 utt1	B	But, on, on T V I think, they try to throw in good stuff,

sv	39 utt5	A	and quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing
	b	40 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	41 utt3	A	I guess the economy is effecting also the news media
	b	42 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	43 utt5	A	and I think that nowadays with communications the way they are also, that we can see global events happening as they occur all over the world, like the,
	b	44 utt1	B	Right.

sv	49 utt2	A	you know, twenty years ago, thirty years ago, we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege or luxury to view that.
	sd	50 utt1	B	I mean, you know, I remember, well, just the things that are covered.

ba	53 utt1	A	yes.
	sd	54 utt1	B	I mean, you know, that was just so phenomenal to see this stadium shake and the announcers, you know grabbing,

b	55 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	58 utt1	B	I mean, it's like, that was just something because that was like live and real like you said,

b	61 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	62 utt2	B	and then, of course, one thing I think, too, is with tele ,

qw	1 utt2	A	what did you buy?
	sd	2 utt1	B	A Ford Explorer.

br	3 utt1	A	I'm sorry, what?
	sd^r	4 utt1	B	A Ford Explorer.

bh	5 utt1	A	really.
	ny	6 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	7 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	8 utt1	B	And, I'd probably buy another, this is the first American vehicle I've owned.

b	9 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	10 utt1	B	So I would probably purchase another one, I would be more selective in the dealership that I purchased it from

bh	11 utt1	A	really?
	nn	12 utt1	B	No,

sd	13 utt1	A	if I had the money, I think I would love to own a, a B M W.
	qw	14 utt1	B	And why would that be?

sv	15 utt4	A	It seems like they last forever.
	qw	16 utt1	B	What's wrong with the Volvo.

sv	17 utt1	A	I don't know, they're not as nice looking.
	b	18 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	19 utt3	A	but everyone I've seen is kind of plain,
	qw	20 utt1	B	what city are you calling from?

sd	21 utt1	A	Sherman.
	b	22 utt1	B	Oh.

qw	23 utt1	A	Where are you?
	sd	24 utt1	B	Up in Dallas.

b	27 utt1	A	Yeah.
	b^m	28 utt1	B	B M W or Mercedes, yeah,

sd	29 utt4	A	my actual favorite cars were, like the Ford Thunderbirds of nineteen eighty five.
	b	30 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	31 utt3	A	but I don't own one of those either .
	qw	32 utt1	B	What do you presently drive?

sd	33 utt1	A	Mercury Topaz.
	ba	34 utt1	B	fun.

sd	35 utt1	A	cheap taste in cars, okay .
	sv	36 utt1	B	Well there nothing wrong with those, they're nice veh , they're nice vehicles, nothing wrong with those.

sd,o@	37 utt2	A	they're all right, it's, it's a good car, * Looks like A.37 and 39 should = 3 slash units I mean, I've never had any problem with it. / * See parsing note above
	sd	40 utt2	B	it's just everybody has their own taste,

fa	41 utt1	A	Sorry I roped on Volvos then .
	br	42 utt1	B	Huh?

fa^r	43 utt1	A	Sorry I roped on Volvos then.
	bd	44 utt1	B	no,

sd	47 utt1	A	See I don't much about them I guess.
	b	48 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	49 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	50 utt4	B	they're kind of low to the ground after driving the Explorer.

b	51 utt1	A	Really.
	sd	52 utt1	B	Because you can't see a car ahead of you,

b	53 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	qo	54 utt2	B	what are your feelings about American versus European cars?

sd	55 utt3	A	I don't like Japanese cars,
	qw	56 utt1	B	Why not.

h	57 utt9	A	so, I don't know.
	ba	58 utt1	B	That's the way it goes, I guess.

qy^d	59 utt2	A	I guess this is your first time to buy American,
	ny	60 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	61 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	62 utt1	B	I don't know, I mean, I think European cars are great, course you've got to have metric wrenches and stuff

b	63 utt1	A	Really.
	sd	64 utt1	B	excellent warranty, I mean, just, unbelievable warranty.

b	67 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	68 utt1	B	I wouldn't send my dog to buy a car from Middlekauff Ford.

br	69 utt1	A	Where?
	sd^r	70 utt2	B	Middlekauff Ford in Plano.

bk	71 utt1	A	Okay.
	sd	72 utt2	B	their attitude is just slimy.

sd	75 utt7	A	and the people, wouldn't reimburse them for anything.
	qy	76 utt1	B	Middlekauff wouldn't?

br	79 utt1	A	What.
	sd^t	80 utt2	B	I was asking you some questions about the telephone and how many have you been doing,

b	81 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd^t	82 utt1	B	they don't want to hear that.

sd^t	83 utt1	A	just about a week.
	qy^t	84 utt1	B	Is that all?

ny^r	85 utt2	A	yeah.
	ba	86 utt1	B	Good Lord,

b	87 utt1	A	Really.
	fe	88 utt1	B	God, I've,

ba	89 utt1	A	wow.
	sd^t	90 utt1	B	That's why I wasn't sure if this was the second time around or what.

fc	91 utt2	A	you too.
	ad	92 utt1	B	And keep smiling.

ft	93 utt2	A	thanks.
	fc	94 utt1	B	Bye, bye.

sd	2 utt2	A	Lucille, I'm on .
	b	3 utt1	B	All right,

qy^t	4 utt2	A	did you hear our topic?
	ny	5 utt1	B	Yes.

sd^t	6 utt2	A	basketball.
	b	7 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	8 utt2	A	I'm a Dallas Maverick fan.
	sd	9 utt1	B	Well, I certainly am too.

sv	12 utt3	A	It just seems like they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possibly be a final team playing for all of it.
	aa	13 utt1	B	Yes, sir.

sd	14 utt1	A	National championship or the world championship, and something like this happens.
	b	15 utt1	B	Oh.

sv	16 utt3	A	I think that probably be evident with the more and more young guys they draft.
	sv	17 utt1	B	Well, it just, it's so discouraging that they can't really,

sd	20 utt3	A	so being a transplanted Texan in the Dallas area, I have to stick with those Dallas Mavericks.
	sv	21 utt1	B	We certainly need to support them,

sd^e	22 utt2	A	we do. You know.
	qy	23 utt1	B	Do you go to the game?

sd	24 utt6	A	and when my kids got to a certain age and went off to school and college and doing their own thing, sort of gets boring going by yourself .
	aa	25 utt1	B	Yes,

aa	26 utt1	A	you bet.
	sv	27 utt1	B	But, maybe they can do some.

sv	28 utt8	A	they trade the nucleus of their power right now.
	aa	29 utt1	B	Yes, sir,

sv	30 utt6	A	Donald Carter, the owner, I think with all he's invested, he deserves a a healthy team for one year and a good break also.
	ba	33 utt1	B	Yes, sir.

sv	34 utt1	A	This thing with Roy Tarpley just upset everyone, I think. Fans, owners, management, everyone.
	sv	35 utt1	B	And they have just done as much as they can for that man,

sv	36 utt2	A	I think they're fools if they ever bring him back .
	aa	37 utt1	B	I do, too.

sd	38 utt2	A	I just would not believe him any more.
	sv	39 utt2	B	I mean, you can't give, anyone too many chances

aa	40 utt1	A	No.
	sv	41 utt1	B	and I think he has gone over the limit.

^q	42 utt2	A	but you can't make him drink.
	aa	43 utt1	B	That's right.

sv	46 utt1	A	But to be making a million dollars a year, that's pretty sad.
	aa	47 utt1	B	It is tragic.

sd	48 utt4	A	and now he's probably an old age of, twenty five or six and making all that money,
	ba	49 utt1	B	Yes, sir.

sv	50 utt2	A	well, that's quite a, that's a little more of a challenge for a young man than they need at that point in their life, I think.
	aa	51 utt1	B	I think you're right.

qy	1 utt1	A	Do you play?
	ny	2 utt1	B	Yeah,

na	3 utt2	A	Well, I'm into it.
	b	4 utt1	B	Yeah,

qy	5 utt1	A	Is anybody?
	nn	6 utt1	B	No

bh	9 utt1	A	Really?
	sd	10 utt2	B	And I'd go up there with friends after school a couple of times every week

b	13 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	14 utt2	B	and then I'd started picking it up again a couple of years back

sd	15 utt5	A	and then, I got on to a team in high school but wasn't very good still. and then quit for awhile
	b	16 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	17 utt3	A	and, I've been playing, you know, off and on when I can.
	b	18 utt1	B	Right.

sd	19 utt1	A	Up in Minneapolis it's not too easy to play in the winter of course
	b	20 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	21 utt2	A	so, I'll be going back down there in May and hopefully be picking it up a little more regularly.
	b	22 utt1	B	Uh huh.

aa	25 utt1	A	I was going to say .
	sv	26 utt1	B	I mean it's a great game

sv	27 utt2	A	that's true, all too many times.
	b	28 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	29 utt1	A	Fortunately, down where I live in Florida, there's some golf courses that are pretty reasonable if you know where to look.
	b	30 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	31 utt1	A	one of them is the University of Florida golf course which is open to the public
	b	32 utt1	B	Right.

sd	33 utt2	A	and that's pretty good.
	b	34 utt1	B	Yeah.

qy	37 utt1	A	Can you get like a student discount type of thing
	na	38 utt1	B	a little bit but not a whole lot.

qw	39 utt2	A	what, what are green fees run there?
	sd	40 utt1	B	well they range anywhere from about five bucks for your basic city type course up to fifty, sixty dollars for a really, really nice course.

sd	41 utt4	A	that's about the same I guess as it is in Florida.
	b	42 utt1	B	Uh huh.

ba	43 utt2	A	that's super.
	aa	44 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	45 utt2	A	uh huh.
	sd	46 utt1	B	Somebody's paying

ba	47 utt1	A	Well, that's the way to do it though.
	aa	48 utt1	B	Yeah

sv	49 utt1	A	That's the way to get in some good practice without having to pay for it all the time .
	aa	50 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	51 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	52 utt1	B	It's nice to see those , guys.

sv	57 utt1	A	Because once the guy hits the ball and they got to try to follow the ball that's a little difficult.
	aa	58 utt1	B	Right.

sv	59 utt3	A	but like you said, it's kind of boring actually.
	b	60 utt1	B	Uh huh.

bh	61 utt1	A	yeah?
	sd	62 utt1	B	and I was able to go and see one of the rounds of that

sv	63 utt2	A	I bet that would be .
	sd	64 utt1	B	I never really thought it would be that much fun to go to a big golf tournament and watch

sv(^q)	65 utt4	A	you know, looking at it on T V, you're thinking, man, what a boring thing, you know.
	aa	66 utt1	B	Right.

sd	67 utt2	A	I'll have to see if I can't get a chance to go,
	sd	70 utt1	B	I mean it's a lot more exciting than actually watching it on T V.

b	71 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	72 utt1	B	and then they go off to some other hole

qw	75 utt3	A	What do you do for a living?
	sd	76 utt1	B	I'm a student right now.

bh	77 utt1	A	you are?
	ny	78 utt1	B	Yeah.

qw	79 utt1	A	which university?
	sd	80 utt1	B	At, Indiana University.

qw	81 utt3	A	What are you going into?
	sd	82 utt1	B	I don't really know.

qy^g	83 utt2	A	Definitely not golf, right ?
	nn	84 utt1	B	No .

qw	85 utt4	A	what was what was that movie that they had out?
	b	86 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	87 utt4	A	and I can't remember.
	b	88 utt1	B	Huh.

sd	89 utt2	A	It was on network T V a couple of times.
	bh	90 utt1	B	yeah?

ny	91 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	92 utt1	B	Well, you know, it seems like, well you go to work every weekend. Play, maybe, one, two tournaments a month. You come in about tenth, you'd still be doing pretty well.

sv	97 utt2	A	that's a good thing.
	b	98 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	99 utt3	A	and, fortunately, I've been able to play some golf on a student budget which is real helpful, you know.
	b	100 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	101 utt3	A	You hear about Japan. I guess, you know, it's like two hundred fifty dollar minimum or three hundred dollar minimum just like to practice even .
	b	102 utt1	B	Right .

b	105 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	106 utt1	B	that is out of control.

sd	109 utt2	A	I guess they have those, driving ranges that are actually stacked one on top of the other.
	b	110 utt1	B	Yeah

sd	111 utt5	A	They were into it.
	b	112 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	2 utt1	A	I'm from Dallas.
	bk	3 utt1	B	Okay,

b	4 utt1	A	Okay.
	sd	5 utt1	B	Well, I'm in Dallas right now,

b	6 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	7 utt1	B	well, I don't know if you know,

b	10 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	11 utt1	B	So we're trying to promote that, because she thought we just put them in a special trash can and threw them away,

sd	12 utt2	A	Richardson does.
	bk	13 utt1	B	okay.

sd	14 utt1	A	they started with newspapers and, of course aluminum cans, and and bottles and plastic.
	b	15 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	16 utt2	A	I didn't know there were different types of plastic, though.
	aa	17 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	20 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	21 utt1	B	it's just different kinds of plastics, like the clear plastic is different from that milky looking plastic.

bk	22 utt1	A	okay.
	sd	23 utt1	B	And that's what the different types are.

b	24 utt1	A	Yeah.
	b	25 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	26 utt1	A	It seems to be made out of something different.
	b	27 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	28 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	29 utt1	B	I know there's a long scientific name

b	30 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	31 utt1	B	I don't know if they do it all over,

b	32 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	35 utt1	B	That's something since we all seem to have an abundance of those plastic grocery bags .

aa	36 utt2	A	Yeah.
	sv	37 utt1	B	I know we use them for trash can liners and a lot of other things.

bf	40 utt1	A	Lunch bags.
	aa	41 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	42 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	43 utt1	B	The only problem with those is sometimes they get holes in the bottom.

sd	44 utt2	A	they do.
	sd(^q)	45 utt1	B	It's like, whoops, there goes my chips

b	46 utt1	A	Yeah.
	^q	47 utt1	B	okay,

b	48 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	qy	49 utt2	B	in fact did you happen to see TWENTY TWENTY the other night?

nn	50 utt1	A	no.
	sd	51 utt1	B	They did a program,

b	54 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	55 utt1	B	They have built up one mountain.

b	56 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	57 utt1	B	They built up one mountain, covered it with grass, and put ski lifts on it,

ba	60 utt1	A	Wow.
	sd	61 utt3	B	it's, Riverview, Ohio or some place up there.

b	62 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	63 utt1	B	But I thought it was a pretty neat idea.

sv	66 utt2	A	they'll run out of space before long.
	aa	67 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	68 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	69 utt1	B	So, they're going to be called the Twin Peaks.

b	70 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd(^q)	71 utt1	B	So, it's like, well, no, Honey.

b	72 utt1	A	Right.
	^q	73 utt2	B	and you make them into new things,

b	74 utt2	A	yeah.
	qy	75 utt1	B	so do you all go ahead,

sv	76 utt1	A	They don't even know that paper comes from trees now,
	aa	77 utt1	B	Well, yeah,

b^m	78 utt1	A	How do you grow paper?
	sd(^q)	79 utt1	B	Was like, well, from trees That's why you have to cut down trees and why you have to plant more trees.

^q	82 utt1	A	And how do you grow aluminum?
	aa	83 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	88 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	89 utt1	B	But at least she knows that that is something that people need to be doing,

sd^t	1 utt3	A	And we are to just discuss what substances do you think that contribute most to air pollution, as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us.
	aa	2 utt1	B	Right.

qy	3 utt1	A	does your work entitle, anything of environmental along these lines?
	sd	4 utt1	B	I'm in the legal department

b	5 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	6 utt1	B	And I don't know too much about the air pollution thing.

b	7 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	8 utt2	B	And supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants from what I've heard, that everything would be in, you know, confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up.

sd	9 utt3	A	I work in environmentals, projects right now.
	bk	10 utt1	B	okay.

sd	11 utt1	A	And so the Sherman deal lost a lot of hair over that project.
	b	12 utt1	B	Oh .

sd	13 utt1	A	what we run into, is we have the Texas Air Control Board, T A C B, that send out, jurisdictions under which we have to, reply to.
	b	14 utt1	B	Uh huh.

ad	15 utt3	A	look what we've done here at T I.
	b	16 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	17 utt2	A	this is our side a , allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage.
	b	18 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	19 utt2	A	It's in, in, in tons per year.
	b	20 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	21 utt3	A	We, are very, aware of the opacity, which is the thickness of a stack emissions.
	b	22 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	27 utt1	A	So it's a full time, everybody has their home phone number type of job.
	qy	28 utt1	B	Now is that place built

sd	29 utt3	A	It's been pitched to the Sherman City Council with, open arms, as well as the public.
	b	30 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	31 utt3	A	and, Tom Jones, our corporate environmental guys handle the project.
	b	32 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	33 utt2	A	I think it's just a matter of fund, funds right now as I understand it.
	b	34 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	35 utt8	A	It will have something coming out of the stackhouse it was, it was human nature.
	b	36 utt1	B	Right.

sd	39 utt1	A	and, it's an interesting job.
	sd	40 utt1	B	Well, I know from some of the sites that we've had, quite a list of cites that have gone bad

am	41 utt1	A	Possibly.
	b	42 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	43 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	44 utt1	B	there was one site that they cleaned up

sd	47 utt3	A	we have duckwork and all those type of interesting pieces of equipment where, they have, that we sample
	sd	48 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	49 utt5	A	And we mix it with concrete and actually, potash, per se, and concrete and then actually put it in the ground. But not in a hazardous waste location because it's, basically, a concrete slab.
	b	50 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	55 utt6	A	I've enjoyed speaking with you,
	b	56 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	57 utt3	A	I was responsible for all the planning and engineering over the corporate, or in the north building .
	bh	58 utt1	B	you were?

ny	59 utt1	A	Yeah.
	bk	60 utt1	B	okay.

o	61 utt1	A	So, I hope you like your office.
	aa	62 utt1	B	Yes.

b	63 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd(^q)	64 utt2	B	People used to come and laugh and go, gee, I hadn't seen one of those ten, fifteen years.

sv	67 utt2	A	Well, I think what changed everything is, y'all were the only ones that make any money for TI, here in the last ten years, Ju ,
	sd	68 utt1	B	We, finally got a little respect.

sv	71 utt2	A	And that's, when you start, when you start paying your way, you know, Jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys.
	aa	72 utt1	B	Right.

fc	75 utt2	A	I've enjoyed speaking with you.
	fc	76 utt1	B	You too.

fc	77 utt2	A	Bye bye.
	fc	78 utt1	B	Bye.

sd^t	2 utt2	A	we're going to talk about lawn and garden today.
	aa	3 utt1	B	Right.

qrr	6 utt2	A	or do you wish to discuss that?
	nn	9 utt1	B	No,

sd	12 utt2	A	we're neighbors.
	b	13 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	14 utt1	A	Okay .
	sd	15 utt1	B	but grew up in, Iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of lawn and garden work.

ad	18 utt1	A	Can you hang on just a minute?
	aa	19 utt1	B	Yeah.

fa	20 utt6	A	I'm sorry.
	bd	21 utt1	B	No.

ad	22 utt1	A	Go ahead.
	sd	23 utt1	B	So, not growing up familiar with here, when I get a chance I listen to that Neil Sperry and do that .

sd	26 utt1	A	I get a lot of good tips from him.
	b	27 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	28 utt1	A	I have his book, too.
	bh	29 utt1	B	Yeah?

ny	30 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	31 utt1	B	Don't do any, any gardening in the sense of, vegetable gardening

sd	34 utt1	A	Not in Texas.
	sd	39 utt2	B	There was one when, we, when we bought the house

b	44 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	qo	45 utt2	B	What about you?

sd(^q)	46 utt4	A	and I said, huh uh ,
	b	47 utt1	B	Yeah.

^q	48 utt1	A	I can do it much cheaper and better.
	b	49 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	50 utt3	A	and it's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over the territory.
	b	51 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd(^q)	56 utt1	A	And, I thought, well, I'm going to do this all the time.
	ba	57 utt1	B	Well, good.

sd	58 utt3	A	and I took them to a certified, nurseryman the other day,
	b	59 utt1	B	Yeah.

qh	60 utt1	A	and do you know what he told me I needed to do?
	nn	61 utt1	B	No.

^q	64 utt2	A	this is unreal.
	b	65 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	66 utt1	A	So, I think I'll get my son in law to do that for me, if he will.
	b	67 utt1	B	Yeah

sd	68 utt3	A	and I don't know, what happened to it,
	qw	69 utt1	B	What, Well, what kind what kind of trees are they?

sd^r	74 utt2	A	one is, , a maple,
	b	75 utt1	B	Huh.

sd	76 utt3	A	I think it's not a native Texan tree.
	b	77 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	78 utt2	A	and they don't, get any care,
	b	81 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	82 utt2	A	and they're just beautiful.
	b	83 utt1	B	Uh huh

sd	84 utt3	A	and, you know, and, although I don't have too serious a problem,
	b	85 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	86 utt3	A	and you know, Sperry said, you know, that's what happened to the Crepe Myrtles, the last two years that, we are looking at all the freeze damage from the prior two years.
	b	87 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	90 utt1	A	So, I kind of think that maybe that, happened to these large trees that I have.
	b	91 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	92 utt2	A	but, that's one of the hazards I guess of, having a yard.
	b	93 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	96 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	97 utt1	B	but what trees were there when we moved in, had been put in by the developer when he built the house,

sv	100 utt2	A	the quick growing,
	sd	101 utt1	B	And, figured up last night,

b	102 utt1	A	uh huh
	sd	103 utt1	B	three we've lost to, to, freezes between, eighty three and then, a year ago we lost, another one.

sd	108 utt1	A	I don't know how to get rid of these big trees, because one has a circumference of about ten inches,
	b	109 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	110 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	111 utt2	B	two of them, the wind blew over in terms of getting them down.

sd	118 utt2	A	Because you still have to ,
	b	119 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	122 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	123 utt2	B	but what I just used a hand saw and sawed them off at, as close, close to ground level as I could, and then, got s , got some chemical that drill holes and pour in that helps , helps rot the,

bf	134 utt2	A	a stump killer.
	b^m	135 utt1	B	stump ki , yeah, stump killer, and stump rotter,

b	138 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	139 utt1	B	But, this last one had a fair sized root

sd	142 utt3	A	and I think it's some kind of a screwing thing that just rips it right out.
	b	143 utt1	B	yeah,

 %	144 utt2	A	yeah.
	sd	145 utt2	B	and, I took the,

b	148 utt1	A	Sure.
	sd	149 utt2	B	and, and it's filling in with grass, nicely this year, so that, that was worth it

bf	152 utt1	A	A blessing in disguise.
	aa	153 utt1	B	Yeah.

bf	154 utt1	A	I mean, two fold purpose.
	aa	155 utt1	B	Yeah

sd^e	158 utt2	A	I have a self propelled, Snapper.
	b	159 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	160 utt2	A	and it, and it's very difficult to address.
	aa	161 utt1	B	yeah.

sv	164 utt2	A	They're very expensive.
	b	165 utt1	B	But, yeah,

fe	168 utt1	A	booey
	sd	169 utt1	B	And I took it back home,

sv	170 utt2	A	they always try to give you a song and dance.
	sd	171 utt1	B	But, o , one of my sons and a couple of his friends this year have ,

sd^t	1 utt2	A	but, it's camping.
	b	2 utt1	B	Really.

qo	3 utt5	A	How about yourself?
	sd	4 utt1	B	Well, I haven't been in probably about three years.

b	5 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	6 utt1	B	And the last time we went was in, well, I guess it was like hunting season,

sv	11 utt2	A	I bet it's pretty over there.
	sd	12 utt1	B	It is real pretty.

qw	13 utt1	A	What do you think, what kind of camping, are you talking about?
	qy	14 utt1	B	Do you do a lot of fishing?

qrr	15 utt4	A	or do you actually put up a tent
	sd	16 utt1	B	One of the ones that you pull along

bf	17 utt2	A	so you have,
	qy	18 utt1	B	and is it pop up?

ny	19 utt1	A	Yeah.
	b^r	20 utt1	B	Pop up.

qy^g	21 utt1	A	A pop up trailer, huh.
	ny	22 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	23 utt1	A	We have a tent.
	br^m	24 utt1	B	A tent?

sd^e	25 utt2	A	So I guess we really rough it.
	b	26 utt1	B	Really.

sd	27 utt4	A	I've camped, basically almost anywhere, even to the point where we've had to backpack in and everything you carried in was what you had to use to sustain you for that camping trip and had to pack it back out.
	bf	28 utt1	B	So you're a serious camper.

sd	29 utt2	A	But since I've been married and with a family, we have to go where there's restrooms . And playgrounds, and so forth,
	ba	30 utt1	B	Well, that makes sense.

sd	31 utt11	A	We recently moved from the Rocky Mountain area up in, northern Utah down to here because of work, and, haven't been able to enjoy fishing like I used to up there, which is, clear water fishing and streams and rivers.
	qy	32 utt1	B	But when you all went camping is that what you normally, I mean,

sd	33 utt3	A	but mainly what we did was we did a lot of hiking and exploring and just going out and seeing what there was to see, in the area.
	sv	34 utt1	B	I guess probably just wherever you live at has a lot to do with what you're going to do when you go,

o@	35 utt4	A	And, * slash error No, / * slash error
	qy	36 utt1	B	Did you ever like travel around to what's that, the little K O A camps whenever

sd^e	37 utt2	A	we never did that.
	qy	38 utt1	B	ever done that?

sd	39 utt4	A	personally, when we were growing up and when we were going camping, I thought that was a little too structured of a camp ground.
	b	40 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	41 utt1	A	you know, that was mainly for people in motor homes or had trailers and so on and so forth, where, you know, we really wanted to go camping in a tent
	b	42 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	43 utt1	A	and, K O A is geared for the people that have a hookup.
	bf	44 utt1	B	That actually travel, what, city to city, state to state.

sd	45 utt6	A	and we camped in the snow, and in, snow caves,
	sd	46 utt1	B	That's probably where I first started, was in Girl Scouts.

qy^g	47 utt2	A	And you got a lot of that in, huh?
	ny	48 utt1	B	Yeah

qw	49 utt1	A	What do you like to do when you go camping?
	sd	50 utt1	B	well, let's see. I mean, I just like to go

b	51 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	52 utt1	B	and we just kind of go and hang out and just do fun stuff.

qy^g	53 utt1	A	Enjoy it, huh .
	sd	54 utt1	B	Roast marshmallows.

bf	55 utt1	A	Tell scary, or scary stories around the fire
	aa	56 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	57 utt4	A	but I've found out that actually we really enjoy getting away from the television, the telephone
	aa	58 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	59 utt4	A	getting out and enjoying nature and each other as company when we're out camping.
	sv	60 utt2	B	kind of makes you appreciate a lot of the things you take for granted.

aa	61 utt1	A	Yeah
	sd	62 utt1	B	Running water

b^m	63 utt1	A	Running water
	sd	64 utt1	B	your hair dryer

^2	65 utt1	A	and a private bathroom.
	sd	66 utt1	B	curling iron.

aa	67 utt1	A	Yes .
	qo	68 utt1	B	What about your family.

sd	5 utt1	A	I want a Rolls Royce and a Cadillac .
	ba	6 utt1	B	Hey,

sd	11 utt2	A	I like to work on cars too.
	b	12 utt1	B	Yeah,

ba	13 utt1	A	that's good.
	sd	14 utt2	B	I don't know if I'll ever want another new car again, you know.

sd(^q)	17 utt2	A	they didn't necessarily say buy it new they just said, what would you buy, you know.
	aap	18 utt1	B	Maybe not.

sv	23 utt1	A	a restored, vehicle is great, I think, certainly if it's an old Mercedes will be good.
	b	24 utt1	B	yeah,

ba	33 utt1	A	Well, that's great.
	sd	34 utt1	B	that's not quite authentic,

sv	35 utt2	A	you all, done a lot more,
	sd	36 utt1	B	I had to stop there.

sd	37 utt2	A	when I talk about working on cars I sure don't do that.
	b	38 utt1	B	Yeah,

bk	39 utt1	A	okay.
	sd	40 utt2	B	they just weren't really expensive,

ba	41 utt1	A	that is good, acknowledgeable people.
	aa	42 utt1	B	and, yeah, you know,

ba	45 utt1	A	That's amazing.
	aa	46 utt1	B	yeah,

sd	47 utt2	A	so, I have Chevies, mostly,
	b	48 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	49 utt2	A	well, that's all I've got right now
	b	50 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	53 utt2	A	I'm, a Chevy, I'm an American car person,
	b^m	54 utt1	B	You're an American car person.

sd	55 utt1	A	but I do like Mercedes.
	b	56 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	57 utt1	A	Yeah.
	h	58 utt1	B	and, I don't know,

b	59 utt1	A	Yeah.
	^q	60 utt2	B	we'll try something different

sd	61 utt1	A	Well, I'm not a Ford person and never have been as a kid,
	b	62 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	63 utt3	A	I went to the auto show with my daughter recently, down in Dallas
	b	64 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	65 utt2	A	and, to me the American cars are far superior to the Japanese in styling, engines, right now, I mean,
	b	66 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	71 utt1	A	I'm not saying that they were, a couple of years ago.
	b	72 utt1	B	yeah.

ba	75 utt1	A	yeah.
	sd	76 utt2	B	I'd, I would hate to see the American car industry suffering more than it already has you know, even though right now I'm not driving an American car,

sd	79 utt4	A	but I would like to, put it in that category, by a Cadillac
	b	80 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	81 utt2	A	but I wouldn't, buy a new one
	b	82 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	83 utt2	A	and, you know, of course, if I had the money I'd be happy to by a new one,
	b	84 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	85 utt1	A	but, I do look for a one year old vehicle, with twenty some odd miles or whatever twenty thousand miles, whatever.
	b	86 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	91 utt2	A	I remember those.
	sd	92 utt4	B	and it final just wore out

sv	93 utt1	A	That she may want to save, if she doesn't have it anymore.
	ar	94 utt1	B	No,

sv	95 utt2	A	since they don't make them anymore, that could be turned into a classic, in ten, fifteen years,
	b	96 utt1	B	Yeah.

b^r	101 utt5	A	yeah.
	aa	102 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	103 utt1	A	I'm still a full size person,
	b	104 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	105 utt4	A	but they're, certainly not,
	b	106 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	107 utt3	A	and, and they'll eventually phase them out
	b	108 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	109 utt2	A	and I sure would like one ever those, within the next five years, or so.
	b	110 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	113 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	114 utt1	B	they've scaled everything down so much

sd	115 utt1	A	Well, even the Japanese cars are bigger too
	b	116 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	117 utt1	A	I've never had a Jap ,
	sv	118 utt1	B	now the Lexus are very nice looking cars, you know.

sd	121 utt2	A	I've had friends who had them,
	b	122 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	123 utt3	A	you can't tell one Japanese car from the other, because they all a like,
	aa	124 utt1	B	That's true,

sd	127 utt2	A	I mean, they really all look a like,
	b	128 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	131 utt2	A	I don't have any idea which car it is, until I look at it to see what it is,
	bf	132 utt1	B	What is what,

sd	135 utt2	A	they do have sports cars
	b	136 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	137 utt2	A	you can get a Cadillac for, the same price as you can get a small Japanese, car,
	b	138 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sv	141 utt2	A	it's ridiculous now.
	aa	142 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	143 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	144 utt2	B	I guess it just, seems to me they're all the same shape.

sd	149 utt5	A	but they were, just styled so differently,
	b	150 utt1	B	Really.

sd	153 utt2	A	but they really looked beautiful.
	qy	154 utt1	B	Are they still,

sd^e	155 utt2	A	they have convertibles now in the Cadillac, field
	b	156 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	157 utt3	A	it's not the big, Fleetwood, the one I want, which is been the same in the last twenty years,
	b	158 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	161 utt2	A	the Seville is totally different,
	b	162 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	163 utt1	A	now at the auto show they had fantastic looking cars.
	qw	164 utt1	B	Now when was this,

sd^e	165 utt2	A	it was a month or so ago.
	bk	166 utt1	B	okay,

sd	167 utt1	A	Well, they have it every year.
	b	168 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	171 utt2	A	and, they had all the cars
	bk	172 utt1	B	I see.

sd	173 utt2	A	they had Japanese and German cars,
	b	174 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	175 utt3	A	they had, a new Chevy Suburban, truck, you know,
	b	176 utt1	B	really.

sd	177 utt3	A	they didn't have a price on it, nor did they know had a it would cost,
	b	178 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	179 utt2	A	it had a microwave in it and everything,
	ba	180 utt1	B	my word.

sd	181 utt2	A	they had several futuristic cars.
	ba	182 utt1	B	That's wild, you know,

b	183 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	184 utt2	B	you hear about things like that

sd	187 utt2	A	they had a lot of not broken down, I mean, you know, cut, displayed engines, you know.
	b	188 utt1	B	Uh huh.

aa	193 utt1	A	Yeah,
	b	194 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	195 utt3	A	but again yeah, the American cars were for superior in styling and, new engines,
	b	196 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	199 utt1	A	and, I thing so, because they've been making these four cylinder and six cylinder engines for a while / * spelling "think"?
	sv	200 utt1	B	somebody's finally woken up, you know.

sd	201 utt2	A	and, I think that, I would definitely buy,
	b	202 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd(^q)	203 utt2	A	again there's the question are we in the market,
	b	204 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	205 utt1	A	and I could buy anything, you know.
	aa	206 utt1	B	yeah,

b^r	207 utt2	A	Yeah.
	sv	208 utt2	B	and you really would have to be a dream car because the repair bills are supposedly just constant, you know.

sd	209 utt1	A	Well, I haven't work on them myself so you know, my cars don't go to the shop, you know,
	b	210 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	213 utt3	A	and, I've got three of them
	sv	214 utt1	B	Well, that's good that you can.

sd	215 utt3	A	I think I had one someone welded a muffler on for me, in a years time,
	b	216 utt1	B	really,

sd	219 utt2	A	like I said I don't do that you know.
	sv	220 utt1	B	I think it takes a talent to do that, you know,

b	221 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	222 utt2	B	He drives, drives a Honda.

sd	225 utt3	A	but I worked my way through college as a mechanic
	b	226 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	227 utt1	A	I learned early from, fifteen on, and dropped it for a long time when, when after I got out of college and, then picked it up again later on
	b	228 utt1	B	Right.

sd	235 utt3	A	and I never get in them and just go to the shop at you will, you know.
	sv	236 utt1	B	Well, that's one thing that when you would consider,

b	237 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	238 utt2	B	so, you're pretty lucky in that respect

sd	239 utt2	A	I'm keeping V eight Chevy engines, because that's what I know,
	b	240 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	243 utt3	A	if you, brought your Chevy to me I'd probably have some parts, for it right now, you knows .
	b	244 utt1	B	Uh huh.

ba	249 utt1	A	that's great,
	sd	250 utt1	B	and it's, it's really been so interesting the people you meet because, my husband Carl has called all over the country, you know,

sd	251 utt1	A	I've always wanted to that too.
	sd	252 utt2	B	he's gotten these catalogs try ,

sd^t	1 utt1	A	So, child care, your views.
	sd	2 utt1	B	well, we only have one child right now and another one on the way

qw	3 utt1	A	And what religious faith?
	sd	4 utt1	B	Latter Day Saints.

ba	5 utt1	A	 that's good.
	sd	6 utt1	B	So so that's what I would try to do.

qy^g	9 utt1	A	they do seem to be at the outside edge of both extremes don't they?
	ny	10 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sv	11 utt1	A	And, whenever they are they seem to regulate the good toward the bad instead of bad toward the good.
	aa	14 utt1	B	Right.

^2	15 utt1	A	Better situations.
	aa	16 utt1	B	Yeah.

qy	19 utt1	A	so, have you ever used outside child care?
	nn	20 utt1	B	No,

^2	21 utt1	A	Real day care.
	aa	22 utt1	B	Right.

sd	25 utt1	A	our step daughter's ten now
	b	26 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	27 utt1	A	and most of the day care has been provide for by Grandma.
	sd,o@	28 utt1	B	I like that situation, that's usually real good . / * 2 slash units?

sd	29 utt1	A	But, quite honestly what I believe to be the best day care situation was while we lived up, the Pass of Woodland Park there was, ex school teacher that, did a small amount of before school and after school, you know, kindergartners, or half dayers in her home
	b	30 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	33 utt2	A	and they would read and play,
	bf	34 utt1	B	Have structured, activities and not just, you know, stick them in a corner and say you're on your own.

sd	37 utt2	A	and, despite our beliefs, she was, one of the more, Charismatic Christian faiths
	b	38 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	39 utt1	A	and it worked out wonderfully.
	b	40 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	41 utt2	A	but I don't know that it would be state approved.
	aa	42 utt1	B	That's true.

sd	43 utt3	A	but I do know that the license doesn't seem to, guarantee quality.
	b	44 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	45 utt1	A	now here I believe that child care meets, by in large, certain standards for, balanced food, if they provide food, cleanliness, and levels of supervision levels being defined as number of working adults for number of children
	b	46 utt1	B	Uh huh.

o@	49 utt1	A	but, * I'd definitely call this an incomplete slash unit. Yeah, / * See note on A.49 above
	sv	50 utt1	B	That's, kind of a minimum there that you're getting.

sd	51 utt3	A	and I'm, a backsliding Presbyterian
	sd	52 utt1	B	I like that term .

sd	53 utt1	A	and, I really believe that this Charismatic care, or the Charismatic belief when emphasized on care, or semi Charismatic I might say was quite good.
	b	54 utt1	B	Uh huh.

aa	57 utt2	A	very
	ba	58 utt1	B	Well, that's good.

sv	59 utt1	A	and, the care is what I guess you should emphasize in the term child care instead of the child.
	aa	60 utt1	B	Uh huh.

^2	61 utt1	A	And not have any care.
	aa	62 utt1	B	Right.

qy	63 utt2	A	Do you know had a I'm saying?
	sv	64 utt1	B	Well, even educated play, supervised play, can teach without,

bf	65 utt1	A	Proper interface.
	aa	66 utt2	B	yeah,

sd	67 utt1	A	It's just correctness of social skills, if you will.
	aa	68 utt1	B	Right,

sv	73 utt2	A	it's a very broad issue.
	aa	74 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	75 utt4	A	the owner of the chi , of a, you know, a large child care facility now,
	b	76 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	77 utt1	A	we're not talking somebody that does six kids, in their home or three or whatever.
	b	78 utt1	B	Uh huh.

aa	81 utt1	A	Right.
	b	82 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	83 utt1	A	Their employees earn almost nothing.
	aa	84 utt1	B	Yeah.

qy	85 utt2	A	do you and your husband both work.
	nn	86 utt1	B	No,

ba	87 utt1	A	Well, that's wonderful if you can make it that way.
	sd	88 utt1	B	Well, we decided to,

sv	89 utt1	A	Well, like I said, that's grand if you can pull it off
	b	94 utt1	B	Right.

qy	1 utt1	A	So, do you have any credit cards?
	ny	2 utt1	B	Yes,

b	5 utt1	A	Okay.
	sd	6 utt1	B	But I've gotten rid of all of the credit cards, you know, that I possibly could,

b	7 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	8 utt2	B	credit cards run, what, anywhere from, up to eighteen, nineteen percent, I guess.

b	9 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	10 utt1	B	It's just a bad deal.

sd	11 utt2	A	I have one card.
	b	12 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	13 utt2	A	but right now, it's maxed out .
	aa	14 utt1	B	Absolutely.

b	17 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	18 utt1	B	It's so easy to pull out the plastic,

sd	19 utt3	A	the thing that bothers me worse than the credit cards, I think, is, you mentioned the gasoline credit card.
	b	20 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	21 utt2	A	but I've got, you know, one of the, the instant teller cards that you can use for point of sale purchases.
	b	22 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	25 utt2	A	and it's just it's really amazing how quickly that goes.
	b	26 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	29 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	b	30 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	31 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	32 utt1	B	But, you know, the instant thing may, may be the way of the future you know, to replace checks and every other thing.

sd	33 utt2	A	that's what they've talked about it.
	b	34 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	35 utt1	A	Course it eliminates any waiting period.
	aa	36 utt1	B	It certainly does.

sd	37 utt1	A	God help those people who have to float checks occasionally because you won't be able to with that.
	aa	38 utt1	B	Absolutely.

nn	41 utt1	A	No.
	bk	42 utt1	B	I see.

sd	43 utt2	A	they consider it to be the same as cash well, cause it actually is.
	bk	44 utt1	B	I see,

sv	47 utt2	A	It's better than cash .
	b	48 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	49 utt2	A	it just goes straight in there.
	aa	50 utt1	B	That's right.

aa	51 utt1	A	Right.
	b	52 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	53 utt1	A	Uh huh
	sd	54 utt1	B	But, I have in times past gotten into a bit of trouble with credit cards.

sd	55 utt2	A	but I'm so glad he told me that they, they got to such a point with their credit cards they didn't want to cut them up because they were afraid sometime they might actually need them.
	aa	56 utt1	B	That's right.

sv	59 utt2	A	I mean, that's funny.
	sv	60 utt1	B	Well, that's a novel idea.

sd	67 utt2	A	I want to still have just one just in case.
	b	68 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	69 utt2	A	But, I'd sure want to get it paid down and not use it for a while .
	b	70 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	75 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	76 utt1	B	we plan purchases, you know, pretty well, you know, watch for the best buys, things like that.

sd	77 utt2	A	Well, our limit is, you know, fairly low
	b	78 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	79 utt1	A	and, so that's one thing that's good.
	aa	80 utt1	B	Sure.

sd^t	81 utt1	A	I've got another call.
	by	82 utt1	B	I'm sorry.

fc	83 utt1	A	Okay.
	fc	84 utt1	B	Take care.

fc	85 utt2	A	Bye bye.
	fc	86 utt1	B	Bye bye.

sd	1 utt2	A	and then I also take the WALL STREET JOURNAL.
	qy	2 utt1	B	Do you get a chance to do it at home

sd	7 utt2	A	I'd rather sleep the extra thirty minutes in the morning.
	ba	8 utt1	B	I understand that.

b	9 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	10 utt1	B	and then during the week, I catch up, you know, on the radio on the way to work or if I'm traveling around at lunch or on the way home

sd	11 utt3	A	we're never in home in time to really watch the six o'clock news on television,
	aa	12 utt1	B	No .

sd	13 utt1	A	so we catch the ten o'clock news,
	b	14 utt1	B	Yeah

sv	15 utt2	A	but radio news is rather short.
	aa	16 utt1	B	It is.

sd	17 utt1	A	most of the stations here that are not all news stations you get about five minutes on the hour.
	b	18 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	19 utt1	A	And if you catch the news stations, you don't catch that much in the car.
	bk	20 utt1	B	I see.

b	21 utt1	A	Yeah
	sd	22 utt1	B	it's frustrating to me because I don't know, what do I want to say? I wish that I was around more news.

sd	23 utt3	A	I tried the news magazines like TIME, NEWSWEEK, U S NEWS and WORLD REPORT,
	b	24 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	25 utt4	A	or all of a sudden you look and there's three weeks worth laying on the coffee table
	b	26 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	27 utt2	A	and you wind up throwing them out without reading them.
	aa	28 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	29 utt2	A	so have to depend,
	aa	30 utt1	B	That's true,

sv	31 utt2	A	I guess we're becoming more of a television oriented nation in that I don't think that, my children even read newspapers, other than the T V guide section.
	ba	32 utt1	B	oh no .

sd	33 utt1	A	There's is all, strictly television news.
	sd	34 utt1	B	A little bit that worries me, because I feel like the news is so biased.

aa	35 utt1	A	yeah.
	sd	36 utt1	B	And yes,

b	37 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd(^q)	38 utt1	B	and I'm like, who are you to judge. You know,

sv	39 utt2	A	it's the same thing with, the news magazines, like TIME and the other magazines.
	^q	40 utt1	B	just report the facts.

sv	43 utt1	A	It's hard to celebrate, to separate the news from the comment, because, in the way it's presented their opinions is print, or presented as being the news.
	b	44 utt1	B	Yes.

sv	47 utt1	A	And so then you have to try and sort out what really is the news.
	sv	48 utt1	B	And I feel like they sensationalize things that shouldn't be sensationalized.

aa	49 utt1	A	That's right.
	sd	50 utt1	B	But they keep asking these questions

b	51 utt1	A	Right.
	sv	52 utt1	B	Stupid.

sv	53 utt3	A	and then they devote, an inordinate amount of time on the news cast to their personal ax to grind.
	aa	54 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sv	55 utt1	A	And, particularly the local television. I know the, the Wednesday's Child bit
	aa	56 utt1	B	I agree.

sd	57 utt3	A	I'm not saying that's not important,
	b	58 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	59 utt1	A	but they leave out a real news issue to devote to one of their local pet projects.
	aa	60 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	61 utt1	A	Yeah,
	sd	62 utt1	B	So I guess when I get to listen to the news, it's probably television or radio.

sd	63 utt4	A	and I'm reading it in the evening,
	b	64 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	65 utt1	A	I'm about a day behind most of the time anyway .
	aa	66 utt1	B	Exactly,

b	67 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	68 utt1	B	Well I'm glad tha ,

b	69 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd(^q)	70 utt2	B	and I'm like, how do they seem so together all the time.

b	71 utt1	A	Yeah,
	sd	72 utt1	B	So, I guess news is just part of that rat race for me.

sd	73 utt3	A	my wife and I feel that we never have a moment that we can call our own.
	b	74 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	75 utt2	A	you don't really have time to sit down and thoroughly read a newspaper.
	aa	76 utt1	B	Exactly.

sd	79 utt2	A	Didn't find time to even read it.
	b	80 utt1	B	Yeah,

ad^t	81 utt2	A	well that's about all then.
	fc	82 utt1	B	Well I appreciate talking to you.

fc	83 utt1	A	Nice talking with you.
	fc	84 utt1	B	Have a good evening.

fc	85 utt1	A	Same to you.
	fc	86 utt1	B	Bye bye.

qy^t	1 utt2	A	did you catch your explanation of that?
	ny	2 utt1	B	Yes,

b	3 utt1	A	Okay.
	sd	4 utt2	B	maybe I'm a hard liner

qy	5 utt1	A	You mean the crimes or the punishment should fit the crime?
	na	6 utt1	B	Right.

bk	7 utt1	A	Okay .
	sd	8 utt1	B	again, having participated in jury duty myself, I know , I know how such a diverse group of people get together, the different backgrounds, different ideas, that sometimes you can have one person or two, that can hold up what I consider the proper sentencing, of the person.

ad	17 utt1	A	Could you hang on one minute Jim?
	aa	18 utt1	B	Yes ma'am.

fa	21 utt1	A	I am so sorry to keep you on hold.
	bd	22 utt1	B	No problem.

qy	23 utt1	A	Are you at work?
	ny	24 utt1	B	Yes.

sd	25 utt2	A	I am too.
	b	26 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	27 utt1	A	it's insane.
	sv	28 utt1	B	So many things in their back,

sv^r	29 utt1	A	It's insane.
	aa	30 utt1	B	Yes.

b	43 utt1	A	yes.
	sd	44 utt1	B	And yet, the attorney, for the prosecution could not enter the good man's background into it.

b	49 utt1	A	Yes.
	sv	50 utt1	B	Whereas, I think that's,

sv	53 utt1	A	It seems like ,
	sv	54 utt1	B	Those that should be in jail should be in jail .

sv	55 utt3	A	there's too much, underhanded, things going on that the public are not aware of.
	b	56 utt1	B	Yeah

sv	57 utt2	A	The victim has been victimized twice, not only by the perpetrator of the crime but also, the courts that try to do the justice.
	sv	60 utt1	B	Well, I think this is one of the reasons that also that attorneys have such a, unsavory reputation,

sd	61 utt1	A	I don't have an ounce in my body of credibility toward the judicial system in the United States.
	b	62 utt1	B	Yeah

bh	65 utt1	A	Isn't that terrible?
	sv	66 utt1	B	And, that's not the idea.

sv	71 utt1	A	To get him out of that, criminal mind that he has and to direct, him into a more productive life.
	b	74 utt1	B	Yeah

ba	79 utt2	A	how sad.
	sd	80 utt1	B	And the person that killed him was a young woman who had left the house with full intent to commit crimes, carrying a gun in her purse.

b	81 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	82 utt1	B	And, anyway it'd get to the,

b	83 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	84 utt1	B	Of course it took eighteen months for the trial to happen.

b	85 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	86 utt1	B	So, then, there was a letter writing campaign that went in,

sd	93 utt3	A	I have found that out. That if enough people respond and rise up against the injustices being done, something is going to change.
	b	94 utt1	B	Right.

sv	95 utt1	A	People have to be involved.
	sv	96 utt1	B	This is it

b	97 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	98 utt1	B	and most people don't take the time.

aa	99 utt1	A	That's right.
	sd	100 utt1	B	Again the only reason I took the time is because I was personally acquainted with these people.

aa	101 utt1	A	That's right.
	sd	102 utt2	B	I'm just as guilty as the rest in that respect.

sv	105 utt3	A	but our priorities are a bit backward.
	aa	106 utt1	B	yes.

aa	115 utt1	A	That's correct.
	b	116 utt1	B	Yeah

b^r	117 utt2	A	Yeah.
	b	118 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	121 utt4	A	So if the person is not in the right mind, I mean they had to, put her away.
	b	122 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	125 utt1	A	And we just dismissed the case. You know,
	b	126 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	127 utt2	A	and, she was, taken care of by the proper facility.
	b	128 utt1	B	Yeah.

aa	129 utt2	A	that's true.
	sv	130 utt2	B	And then the amazing thing, of course, is how, some cases can come to trial in thirty days,

sd	1 utt3	A	I have mixed views on all three of them.
	b	2 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	3 utt2	A	what, what's, what's certainly drawn everyone's attention to that is the fact that, many of the inner city and, I guess what we'd call, ghetto or poorer districts, including rural districts, don't seem to be able to produce the students that, indeed many, manufacturing and other, enterprises want.
	b	4 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	7 utt2	A	they can't seem to read properly, do math, properly, and conform to what employers want.
	b	8 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	11 utt5	A	and also, I think that, a certain percentage of, the public colleges produce a fairly decent student, or fairly decent graduate, I should say.
	b	12 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	15 utt1	A	I didn't realize it was that high.
	aa	16 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	23 utt1	A	well that's what I was going to point out, I think it mostly is that technical,
	b	24 utt1	B	Yeah,

ba	27 utt1	A	Wow.
	sd	28 utt1	B	I think, I think I have similar views,

b	29 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	30 utt1	B	and she said that you know, they have to go through, they have to pat the kids down, because they bring guns to school.

sd	33 utt5	A	I just read an, amazing article, I guess, in this week's NEW YORKER about Baltimore, which, went on to talk about,
	b	34 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	39 utt4	A	I do, I do know a few people and have been, have done some business up in Baltimore,
	b	40 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	41 utt4	A	but it was very difficult.
	b	42 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	43 utt2	A	if I'm looking to carry on a conversation, that way, there's a couple of things that really bother me,
	b	44 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	45 utt2	A	I think when I learned the other day, that, the average American, now, watches seven point two hours of television a day,
	b	46 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	49 utt1	A	Now, I don't know what school children, what year that is.
	b	50 utt1	B	Right.

sv	51 utt1	A	I mean that's a hell of a lot time to be sitting in front of the tube.
	b	52 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	55 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	56 utt2	B	my wife teaches, middle school.

bh	57 utt1	A	Really?
	ny	58 utt1	B	Yeah,

bf	59 utt1	A	so you're close to the subject.
	aa	60 utt1	B	yeah,

sd	61 utt2	A	I have nine grandchildren in various parts of the country,
	b	62 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	63 utt1	A	and, of course, you know, I can't speak to the rural or poorer inner city schools,
	b	64 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	65 utt2	A	they live in a fairly nice upper scale neighborhood,
	b	66 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	67 utt1	A	and they seem to be doing extraordinarily well.
	b	68 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	69 utt5	A	But I, I mean, I think that's part of the environment.
	aa	70 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	71 utt2	A	that, that, that could be very well true.
	sd	72 utt1	B	she's, yeah, she can tell, she can tell, you know, when they have kids come in for,

b	75 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	76 utt1	B	they meet with all of the parents,

b	77 utt1	A	Yes.
	sd	78 utt1	B	and she can tell before a parent comes in, normally, you know, give or take, eighty, ninety, per cent, you know, what the parents are going to be like when they come in, and the responses the parents will give back.

bh	83 utt1	A	No kidding.
	ny	84 utt1	B	yeah.

sd	85 utt2	A	I guess I can understand that.
	b	86 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	87 utt1	A	However, I'm a product of the New York City public school system from fifty years ago, maybe not that long ago,
	b	88 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	89 utt3	A	and so, I always felt I didn't get a real good education in the grammar schools and part of high school,
	b	90 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	91 utt6	A	and we did it
	b	92 utt1	B	Right.

sd	93 utt1	A	and I thought a great deal of the success that they had in their education was due to the low student teacher ratio.
	sv	94 utt1	B	I think it's probably very true.

sv	95 utt1	A	And, I, I think that's a formula that could be applied everywhere, except it must cost a heck of a lot of money if you do, it in public school.
	b	96 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	107 utt1	A	Yeah.
	^q	108 utt1	B	let's sit down and read together.

sv	109 utt1	A	Well, that, that's, that, that must be, then if that's,
	b	110 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	113 utt2	A	I think we both agree on that, then, then, then a parent, parental involvement has to be there.
	aa	114 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	117 utt4	A	and it seems to me that money could be more well spent somewhere else.
	sd	118 utt1	B	But you know what's really funny is that there's been some research, because I'm a, I'm a college professor, and, and, a lot of the research shows that like, Georgetown, while Hewing was playing at Georgetown, basketball, Georgetown, and they were winning, endowment to the university, in other words, money that could to everything, everything, and normally gets directed away from sports, realistically, a lot of the, was, was probably, two thirds, I guess it's now two thirds of what it was when they were national champions.

b	129 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	132 utt1	B	In other words, while they're national champions, people donate more money.

b	135 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	136 utt1	B	Average human beings like you and I, average Joes, that make a decent salary, that are a graduate of the school, send big bucks, like couple hundreds of dollars,

b	137 utt2	A	but I mean, right.
	sd	140 utt2	B	but thousands of people,

bf	141 utt2	A	you say other things than sports, though.
	ar	142 utt1	B	Because, no,

sv	143 utt3	A	but I mean, they don't just send it to the new stadium,
	aa	144 utt1	B	Right,

b	145 utt1	A	Really.
	sd	146 utt1	B	Because when Georgetown was number one, their, their money that was donated to them from companies, from l , from business people, from graduates, whatever, was up into, you know, like twenty million dollars,

b	151 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	152 utt2	B	and now it's down to like, fourteen million.

sd^r	157 utt1	A	Well, I never thought, of that benefit,
	b	158 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	159 utt2	A	but the consequence, then,
	b	160 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd(^q)	161 utt2	A	my, I guess what I'd have to say about that, is, there can only be one champion .
	b	162 utt1	B	Yeah.

qh	165 utt1	A	Isn't that something, though,
	aa	166 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	167 utt1	A	I didn't realize that.
	qy^d	168 utt1	B	but, smaller schools aren't like that,

nn	169 utt1	A	No.
	qy^d	170 utt1	B	only the big time schools show that.

ny	171 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	172 utt1	B	But you're right,

b^r	173 utt2	A	yeah.
	sv	174 utt1	B	but swimming never gets much glory, so it really doesn't matter.

sd	175 utt1	A	Well, Mark Spitz made a lot of money on it.
	aa	176 utt1	B	That's true,

sd	177 utt3	A	but he didn't make it.
	b^m	178 utt1	B	He didn't make it,

b	179 utt1	A	No.
	sd	180 utt1	B	I would have liked it if he would have, though,

b	181 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	182 utt1	B	but I think, realistically you know, you read the, the research studies,

b	183 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	184 utt2	B	and, I don't think he would have made it simply because the event he was trying to swim, the research shows that distance running, so I would assume distance swimming might be similar, that,

b	185 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	186 utt2	B	and he was good at distance, Spitz, as a swimmer, you know,

b^r	191 utt2	A	right.
	sd	192 utt1	B	and, but he's was trying to make it in the sprinter's event,

b	193 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	194 utt1	B	and most of them, are under twenty five.

sv^t	197 utt2	A	we're getting off the subject here a bit,
	b	198 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	199 utt1	A	but I do want to add this to that, because I was quite interested in that myself,
	b	200 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	201 utt2	A	and they didn't think they could capture the excitement to get sponsors, if you brought just the f ,
	ba	202 utt1	B	you're kidding.

sd	203 utt4	A	So it had to be, where they could put it in one segment,
	ba	204 utt1	B	Jeez.

sd	205 utt2	A	and, and I guess, capture the whole thing for some sponsor.
	b	206 utt1	B	Huh.

co	207 utt1	A	Let me ask you another question.
	sd	208 utt1	B	as an athlete, I just hate that.

b	209 utt1	A	Yeah.
	b	210 utt1	B	yeah,

sd	211 utt1	A	Well, if you teach college,
	b	212 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	213 utt1	A	and, I know, when I went to college, I went to summer school,
	b	214 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	215 utt3	A	and I did, take those subjects,
	b	216 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	217 utt3	A	my next thought is, I understand there's a lot of talk now about extending the school year which seems inordinately short anyway, compared to the Japanese, or the Germans.
	b	218 utt1	B	Uh huh.

aa	225 utt3	A	that's right .
	sd	226 utt1	B	and something you have to consider, too, because I know as a, as a former high school teacher, I know that from right now,

fp	1 utt1	A	Hello.
	fp	2 utt1	B	Hello .

sv	3 utt1	A	Well, I think it's a very, very complicated,
	b	4 utt1	B	Huh.

sd	7 utt4	A	Because I, in general, like a smaller rather than a larger population, to the land area.
	b	8 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	11 utt1	A	And, I'm in California, which has a lot of immigration. Probably more than any where else in the country, though I'm not sure if that's the case.
	qw	12 utt1	B	Where are you?

b^r	17 utt2	A	yeah.
	sd	18 utt1	B	In Garland, right outside of Dallas.

b^r	19 utt2	A	uh huh.
	sd	20 utt1	B	So, we're getting a large ,

b^r	21 utt2	A	uh huh.
	sd	22 utt1	B	Cambodians, Asians, Vietnamese.

sd	25 utt2	A	well, Texas, used to be part of Mexico, or most of it .
	aa	28 utt1	B	Yes,

b	29 utt1	A	Huh.
	t3	30 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	31 utt4	A	I guess the one thing I do see is that needs to be a solution is, that if you do let people into the country, I do feel you have a certain obligation to, to get them on their feet.
	^2	32 utt1	B	To get them on their,

sv	35 utt2	A	and you're dooming them to being underclass people.
	b	36 utt1	B	Right,

sv	39 utt4	A	And, of course, there are people in the big cities who would like nothing better than to take advantage of them.
	b	40 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	43 utt4	A	but the funding isn't there for very much work to be going on.
	sd	44 utt1	B	And there's a lot of graft, like people giving them information that was free to them anyway if they just knew how to get it.

aa	45 utt2	A	exactly.
	b	46 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	47 utt1	A	I mean, these are people who don't have the foggiest idea about what America's like.
	b	48 utt1	B	Right.

sd	49 utt13	A	But when they initially come over,
	qy	50 utt1	B	You mean, really trying to plant something?

ny	51 utt1	A	Yeah,
	qy	52 utt1	B	Farming?

sd	53 utt2	A	These, are all farmers coming over,
	b	54 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	55 utt2	A	and they're being put in the middle of the city .
	ba	56 utt1	B	that's terrible.

sd	57 utt2	A	they're people who farm on the hillside and then leave the hillside to another hillside and farm on that hillside.
	b	58 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	59 utt8	A	And there was no, real upward movement.
	bf	60 utt1	B	And not being cared for.

sd	67 utt6	A	But I didn't, I wasn't a social worker or anything like that.
	bk	68 utt1	B	All right.

sd	69 utt1	A	I do have friends who have tried to do more, social work, you know, by explaining to people how the language, and what the problems learning English might be and such.
	b	70 utt1	B	Uh huh

sd	77 utt2	A	And people don't realize how different some of the languages they speak are.
	sd	78 utt1	B	Well, I'm an E S L teacher.

bh	79 utt1	A	you are?
	ny	80 utt1	B	Yes.

b	81 utt1	A	Uh huh,
	sd	82 utt1	B	I got my certification.

sd	83 utt1	A	that's been my impression.
	sd	84 utt1	B	I mean, it's like people don't know, what they say,

sd	85 utt2	A	it's not, they're not withholding information,
	sd	86 utt1	B	it's not step for step.

sd	87 utt1	A	they just don't have that information.
	b	88 utt1	B	Yeah

sd	89 utt1	A	they haven't the foggiest idea.
	sd	90 utt1	B	But anyway, I enjoy it.

sv	93 utt1	A	And Spanish is, pretty close to English, really.
	sd	94 utt1	B	but I'm applying for,

sv^r	97 utt1	A	And Spanish is a lot like English.
	sv	98 utt1	B	A lot of our words are the same,

b	99 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	100 utt1	B	like, you know, they just change the pronunciation a little bit.

b	103 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	104 utt1	B	But, I love it.

b^r	107 utt2	A	uh huh.
	sd	108 utt2	B	and I like it.

b	109 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	110 utt1	B	And trying to get them set up, inculturated, into the system.

b	113 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	114 utt1	B	I thought that would be good experience for me.

sv	115 utt1	A	I'm sure it would.
	sd	116 utt1	B	And, I've applied at another district where many of the children are Asian.

b^r	117 utt2	A	uh huh.
	sd	118 utt1	B	And I think that would be wonderful too.

sv	119 utt6	A	I mean, and part of the problem is that, a lot of Chinese and Japanese immigration from, you know, decades ago has been very successful because they valued education and so forth.
	b	120 utt1	B	Right.

sv	121 utt5	A	And it's really much more complicated.
	sv	122 utt1	B	Well, the times were different too.

b^m	123 utt2	A	the times are different, yeah.
	sd	124 utt1	B	My neighbor, let's see, is Jewish.

b^r	127 utt2	A	uh huh.
	sd	128 utt1	B	And he spends,

b	129 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	130 utt2	B	And he thoroughly enjoyed it.

sv	131 utt4	A	I guess another possible solution is, since taxpayers aren't going to start paying more money for this and, and other budgets aren't going to be cut to pay for it, more of the volunteer network service.
	aa	132 utt1	B	No.

sv	133 utt2	A	Because everyone gains from it.
	b	134 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	135 utt4	A	and if it's, you know, just people helping people I think makes the community so much happier.
	b	136 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	139 utt1	A	Yes.
	sd	140 utt1	B	And because they're so deficient in English, they haven't been able to get jobs.

b^r	141 utt2	A	uh huh.
	sd	142 utt1	B	So they'll have to go back and get a degree here. You know, almost start all over.

sd	143 utt5	A	but of course, if you're educated and you don't speak English, no one thinks anything of you.
	aa	144 utt1	B	No,

b^r	145 utt2	A	uh huh.
	sd	146 utt1	B	I feel sorry for her.

fc	149 utt1	A	okay.
	fc	150 utt1	B	Have a good night.

sd	151 utt2	A	it does sound like you have some children to take care of .
	aa	152 utt1	B	Okay.

fc	153 utt2	A	bye bye.
	fc	154 utt1	B	Okay,

sd^e	3 utt3	A	He doesn't have any children yet though.
	b	4 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	5 utt3	A	but I do have some neighbor kids, lots of little neighbor kids.
	b	6 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	7 utt3	A	You know, it's, because like this one that lives right next door, her mother does some work at home on computers
	b	8 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	11 utt1	A	and it just seems like she doesn't have any time for her. Which is kind of sad, you know.
	b	12 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	13 utt4	A	but, actually I do think that the parents should have, you know, a little bit more time to spend with their kids.
	aa	14 utt1	B	I would think so.

sd	15 utt3	A	and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about five other kids that she baby sat, you know
	b	16 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	17 utt3	A	So we had a lot of time together that way you know.
	b	18 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	19 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	20 utt2	B	and so she was always home for us

b	21 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	22 utt1	B	and I always, really appreciated that. Having her there you know, when I came home from school and when I worked,

sd	25 utt4	A	Because most of them, the father and mother both work, you know.
	b	26 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	29 utt1	A	So you know he's not home very often.
	b	30 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	31 utt2	A	the kids I know miss that.
	aa	32 utt1	B	They really do.

o	33 utt1	A	You know.
	sv	34 utt1	B	a family without a father, it's, a really hard thing.

sd(^q)	35 utt3	A	I suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because, you know, he is out working trying to make some money for, you know, we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth, you know.
	b	36 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy	39 utt2	A	So, are you planning on, having any children
	ny	40 utt1	B	yeah.

b	41 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	b	42 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	43 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	44 utt1	B	And, Then we will try.

sd	47 utt1	A	That's what my daughter in law told me. That they were going to have kids probably after two years of marriage.
	b	48 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	51 utt5	A	so maybe they just decided that, if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night.
	aa	52 utt1	B	Yeah,

o	53 utt1	A	You know.
	sd	54 utt1	B	Well, We really want to have a family.

b^r	61 utt2	A	Right.
	sv	62 utt1	B	give them an edge,

b^r	65 utt2	A	Right.
	sd	66 utt1	B	But then, a family is definitely a high priority.

qrr	67 utt3	A	or do you work or what?
	sd	68 utt1	B	Well, well I am in, I am in a different situation.

b	69 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	70 utt1	B	and I am home on furlough.

b^r	71 utt2	A	Uh huh.
	sd	72 utt1	B	And then we go back for four years.

b	73 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	74 utt1	B	So, we will share the job of raising the family.

b^r	75 utt2	A	Uh huh.
	sd(^q)	76 utt2	B	then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard about schooling, like do you want to home school your kids on a computer program you know, that kind of thing

b	79 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	^q	80 utt1	B	or do you send them away to boarding school

sd	1 utt4	A	but, I found it very difficult to find good child care when I was looking for a place to for stay while I thought school,
	b	2 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	3 utt4	A	and that worked.
	ba	4 utt1	B	Well, that's good.

sd	5 utt3	A	but when they got older I wanted them to be in a school type situation, I think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and, and be around kids their own age because I think that would prepare them for school also, it's real important , that they do that, that they get that preparation for school,
	b	6 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	11 utt4	A	I wanted them to learn to play I didn't academics forced on them at an early age.
	b	12 utt1	B	Yeah,

b^m	13 utt2	A	for the kids.
	b	14 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	15 utt1	A	Yes.
	sd	16 utt2	B	well, I'm just recently married.

b	17 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	18 utt1	B	So I don't have any children. Though we plan on having them soon

b	19 utt1	A	Okay.
	sv	20 utt2	B	but I think, that that's probably one of the biggest difficulties,

ba	23 utt1	A	Wonderful.
	b	24 utt2	B	Yeah,

ba	27 utt1	A	great.
	sd	28 utt2	B	and it's nice for me because, most of the time you have so much flexible hours so that I could probably work two or three days a week, and then one or two evenings, so that if my wife does go back to work part time, there probably will be a possibility that I could stay home two days that she would go to work and that I would have to teach at night.

ba	33 utt1	A	that's, wonderful.
	aa	34 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	35 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	36 utt1	B	I think we're very lucky because just my job sort of builds in flexible schedules,

ba	37 utt1	A	That's wonderful.
	sd	38 utt1	B	I can even teach on Saturdays and, and things, like that.

ba	41 utt1	A	great,
	b	42 utt2	B	Yeah,

b	43 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	44 utt1	B	and one of the things they made in,

ba	45 utt1	A	that's, wonderful too,
	sd	48 utt2	B	my sister in law is a clinical speech pathologist,

b	49 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	50 utt1	B	so, she is als ,

b	51 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	52 utt1	B	it would be three years,

b	53 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	54 utt1	B	so I guess she took off three all together

ba	55 utt1	A	that's wonderful.
	aa	56 utt1	B	Yeah,

ba	57 utt1	A	dear.
	sd	58 utt1	B	and she won't do it in the summer because her kids are home from school.

b	59 utt2	A	yeah.
	sd	60 utt1	B	So I don't know what they are going to do.

sv	61 utt1	A	you know that's an ideal situation,
	b	62 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	63 utt1	A	but not many people can afford, something like,
	aa	64 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	67 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	68 utt1	B	so she was probably twenty seven when they were married,

b	69 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	70 utt1	B	so she already had gotten bachelors and masters and established herself in a, profes , in a practice almost. where, you know, he then they waited a couple years

b	73 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	74 utt2	B	and he got himself pretty far along, I guess they didn't have kids until he was about, twenty six

b	77 utt1	A	Sure.
	sv	78 utt1	B	but, I think the longer you wait the easier it is, if you have that professional occupation where you can change.

aa	81 utt1	A	yeah,
	b	82 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	83 utt1	A	but they're are just so many people out there that aren't that, lucky,
	b	84 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	87 utt1	A	because I'm a single parent,
	b	88 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	89 utt3	A	I, still am teacher,
	b	90 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	91 utt1	A	and it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was what I wanted, where I could, have piece of mind when I taught school / * transcriber spelling error "piece" should be "peace"
	b	92 utt1	B	Yep.

sd	95 utt2	A	and I knew my kids were being taken, care of.
	b	98 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	99 utt2	A	and, plus I, wanted them to get something out of it, I just didn't want it to be a day where they went and slept and ate cookies and, that's it .
	b	100 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	105 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	106 utt1	B	and sometimes they flunk kindergarten now.

b	107 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	108 utt1	B	They don't let them into kindergarten unless they can count to ten and know their A B C s

b	109 utt1	A	Sure.
	sv	110 utt2	B	it's a very important part of your life

aa	113 utt1	A	I agree with that.
	sd	114 utt1	B	you know, I can see that when you make that point.

sd	115 utt1	A	Well, the thing is, I teach this grade and I can see very readily the kids that didn't never learn socially how to get along with other, children
	b	116 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	119 utt2	A	and they're the ones that are having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically, because they're should be, there's to many things in their way, / * to should be too
	b	120 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	123 utt3	A	and they did learn to get along with other people.
	b	124 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sv	125 utt3	A	and I bet if we trace back to their, early childhood we could see some, you know, times they didn't get to play or be with other kids their own age really learn how do get along with, people.
	b	128 utt1	B	Yep.

b	131 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	132 utt1	B	And I bet,

b	133 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	134 utt2	B	I bet you could trace all the way back .

sv	135 utt1	A	I bet you could too, because you know, kids have to learn how to get along with other people,
	b	136 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	139 utt1	A	and if they don't they just don't turn out to be really, you know, good adults or, successful adults I should say,
	aa	140 utt1	B	That's true,

sd	143 utt4	A	and they daily have problems with whoever is taking care of the child,
	b	144 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	145 utt1	A	or they switch a lot, which is not good for the child either.
	aa	146 utt1	B	Yep,

sv	147 utt3	A	and it would be ideal like you hope when you have children, your wife gets to stay home,
	b	148 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	151 utt1	A	I would have given anything if I would have been able, to stay home with my children.
	b	152 utt1	B	Yeah,

aa	155 utt1	A	Yeah,
	sd	156 utt1	B	because of having, you know, flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule.

b	157 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	158 utt2	B	I teach a computer classes

ba	159 utt1	A	great.
	sd	160 utt2	B	and I'm also, you know,

b	163 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	164 utt1	B	and, you know, you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a Saturday, which means, that, you know, whole week's worth of courses

ba	165 utt1	A	that's, wonderful.
	sd	168 utt2	B	so that lets you be available three days during the week, you know,

ba	169 utt1	A	great.
	sd	170 utt2	B	so you be will home with your kids you know

b	175 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	176 utt2	B	so, by the time he got home he was so tired

b	177 utt1	A	Sure.
	sd	178 utt1	B	and I think he missed a lot of, our up bringing.

b	179 utt1	A	Sure.
	sd	180 utt1	B	You know, my mother

b	181 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd,o@	182 utt2	B	it's funny I don't think she had to work until we started school I think teenagers become much more expensive . / * 2 slash units?

bh,sd,o@	183 utt1	A	don't they though that's what I have right now , * Seems like a slash should be placed after "though" thirteen and a sixteen year old.
	sv	186 utt1	B	It's probably costing you a fortune.

sv	189 utt1	A	they really are expensive,
	sd	190 utt1	B	My goodness, if you want them to be able to drive the car, the insurance bill.

sd	193 utt2	A	most of the area where we live in most of the kids have cars.
	b	194 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	195 utt1	A	So, you know, right now I'm looking for a little truck for my for my son,
	b	196 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	197 utt2	A	so I can afford it,
	b	198 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	199 utt1	A	but, you know, I just look forward to him helping me out because I for years just car, drove in carpools all over the place
	^2	200 utt1	B	Carpools,

sd(^q)	201 utt2	A	and, And it will be nice just to be able to have him say will you go to the store, will you take his sister somewhere, something like that.
	b	202 utt1	B	Yeah,

aa	211 utt1	A	That's right.
	b	212 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	213 utt1	A	It, does for ever.
	sd^r	214 utt1	B	it lasts a long time.

qy^t	217 utt2	A	You think we've talked a long enough time?
	o@	218 utt1	B	Well, normally they come in, * slash error cause they'll come in in ten minutes normally and stop us. / * slash error

qy^d^t	221 utt1	A	in ten minutes, you have to talk that long.
	ng^t	222 utt1	B	Well, you don't have to

b	223 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd^t	224 utt2	B	you go the length

b	225 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd^t	226 utt1	B	Depends on how old the tapes are at that time.

bk	227 utt1	A	I see.
	b	228 utt1	B	Uh huh.

bk^r	229 utt1	A	I see.
	b	230 utt1	B	Yeah.

qw	231 utt2	A	where are you from?
	sd	232 utt1	B	This is Baltimore, Maryland.

sd	235 utt2	A	because that's where T I is .
	aa	236 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd^t	3 utt1	A	I guess we're supposed to talk about music.
	aa	4 utt1	B	Okay.

qy	5 utt3	A	are you a musician yourself?
	na	6 utt1	B	well, I sing.

b	7 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	8 utt1	B	I don't play an instrument.

qr	9 utt3	A	do you sing in a choir or a choral group?
	ng	10 utt1	B	not right now.

qw	11 utt2	A	What kind of singing do you like to do?
	sd	12 utt1	B	pretty much anything.

qrr	13 utt4	A	or have you studied?
	ny	14 utt1	B	yeah.

b	15 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	16 utt1	B	A long time out, all through college and everything I was in the choirs.

b	17 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	18 utt1	B	And I've had some classical vocal training.

bh	19 utt1	A	really?
	ny	20 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qr	21 utt2	A	did you do that in, Texas, or somewhere else?
	nn	22 utt1	B	No,

qw	23 utt2	A	Whereabouts?
	sd	24 utt1	B	in Germany.

sd	25 utt6	A	and now for about the last eight years I've sung in a church choir here, in Texas.
	b	26 utt1	B	yeah.

sd	27 utt2	A	And, so I enjoy, just the chorals singing a lot, as well.
	b	30 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qr	31 utt2	A	are you a soprano, alto, or,
	sd	32 utt1	B	Soprano.

qr	33 utt6	A	Do you have a particular composer that you like or, a particular type ?
	sd	36 utt1	B	as far as opera goes, I'm, I think most fond of Verdi.

qy	39 utt3	A	have you ever done any, if, if you had done MADAM BUTTERFLY.
	nn	40 utt1	B	No,

b	43 utt1	A	Yes.
	sd	44 utt1	B	but, that's, Puccini, I think,

sd	47 utt4	A	and, it was really wonderful.
	b	48 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	49 utt4	A	and, so, it was quite popular.
	b	50 utt1	B	Yeah.

qy	51 utt3	A	so, have you ever wanted to, like guitar or piano or ,
	aa@	52 utt1	B	No. I think it would be nice if I played the piano.

sv	55 utt4	A	I think piano is always good background,
	b	56 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	57 utt5	A	but neither of them stayed with it .
	b	58 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	59 utt2	A	and the other one the boy is, guitar and percussion,
	b	60 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	61 utt3	A	and, I'm sure that for you, it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself, just for practicing and so on.
	aa	62 utt1	B	yeah.

qy	65 utt2	A	Do you have any other kind of music that you like?
	sd	66 utt1	B	I like to listen to all different kinds of music.

sd	69 utt4	A	it might be rock, you know
	b	70 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	71 utt1	A	it was just, he said that just about what you said, that he just liked all kinds of music.
	b	72 utt1	B	Yeah

sd	73 utt1	A	And that was neat for me to hear that somebody is,
	sd	74 utt1	B	There's, you know, some of the really totally country stuff, I don't really particularly like

qy	75 utt3	A	do you have any plans to, do anything with your music in the near future
	sd	76 utt1	B	Well, I have like, we,

b	77 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	78 utt1	B	but I don't really know how to go about it without having a degree

sv	85 utt2	A	and, that's often a good way to get back into it again.
	b	86 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	87 utt7	A	and you get to know you know, people socially as well as in a musical setting,
	b	88 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	89 utt2	A	so that's always fun.
	b	90 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	91 utt4	A	and, and I think we sing better because of that.
	b	92 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	93 utt2	A	I think, you know, I think we sing more like, people who trust each other , which is really nice.
	ba	94 utt1	B	That's good.

qw	97 utt2	A	So, whereabouts in, Texas are you, if I could ask?
	sd	100 utt1	B	I'm in Flower Mound.

bk	101 utt2	A	okay.
	b	102 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	103 utt2	A	so, we're just not too far apart, actually.
	aa	104 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	105 utt5	A	so I'm always asking where in the state, you know, the person is from if they're in Texas.
	b	106 utt1	B	Yeah.

qy	107 utt1	A	do you have a family?
	na	108 utt1	B	I'm married.

qrr	109 utt3	A	or you know, if you had, other musical people in your family.
	br	110 utt1	B	I'm sorry?

qy^d	111 utt1	A	if you have other people in your family who are also musical.
	na	112 utt1	B	a little bit.

qy	115 utt2	A	were your parents that musical?
	ny	116 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd^t	119 utt2	A	But, I'll bet we've done at least five minutes.
	sd	120 utt1	B	Probably .

fc	121 utt1	A	Well, I've enjoyed talking with you, Becky,
	fc	122 utt1	B	Okay.

fc	123 utt2	A	and, maybe we'll talk again.
	fc	124 utt1	B	All right,

fc	125 utt2	A	Bye bye.
	fc	126 utt1	B	Bye bye.

sd	1 utt5	A	and we try to stick to it .
	aa	2 utt1	B	I know.

sv	3 utt3	A	That's the kind of things that throw you off.
	sd	4 utt1	B	we do ours more monthly than long range.

b	5 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	6 utt1	B	and when he gets paid, I pay all the bills.

b	7 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	8 utt1	B	And out of his check they take a savings

b	11 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	12 utt1	B	So, as far as extra savings, we really don't have that much extra to save.

b	13 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	14 utt1	B	his check, once a month, pays all the bills.

b	17 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	18 utt1	B	and it works out real well that way.

b^r	19 utt2	A	yeah.
	sv	20 utt1	B	but budgets are horrible.

sd	23 utt4	A	and so we pay all of the little bills, one paycheck and then like the mortgage and the electric bill, you know, those big bills the second second pay
	b	24 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	27 utt2	A	and then, again, he does have a savings that comes out, you know, for Christmas and stuff, that kind of thing.
	b	28 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	29 utt2	A	that kind of thing.
	aa	30 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	31 utt1	A	But it's nice that it's there, you know.
	b	32 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd^r	37 utt2	A	It's nice that it's there.
	aa	38 utt1	B	I know.

b	39 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	40 utt1	B	And, of course, the cost of living keeps going up so much.

b	41 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	42 utt1	B	Groceries are outrageous

sd	43 utt3	A	That's kind of how I felt when I was working because it seemed like we spent more.
	b	44 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	45 utt3	A	Then a lot of it was going to, daycare and that kind of thing.
	b	46 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	47 utt4	A	and I don't know why
	sd	48 utt1	B	Well I know that since I do work, I buy a lot of quicker cuts of meat and, well the frozen things for the microwave and things like that.

bf	53 utt2	A	you kind of try and buy bigger quantities.
	sd	54 utt1	B	And I'll stop by the deli and pick up, chicken or whatever. Where if I did not work, I'm sure that the grocery bill could be managed a lot, better.

bf	55 utt4	A	you could take a little longer. And just watch a little bit more I guess.
	b	56 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	59 utt4	A	It just seems like we save a little bit more whereas, where I was working,
	sv	62 utt1	B	Well, I'm sure you do.

b	63 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	64 utt2	B	But in the summer he's still young enough that I cannot leave him by himself.

b	65 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	66 utt1	B	So in the summer I have that extra

b	67 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	68 utt1	B	and that's usually movies one day, skating one day .

b	69 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	70 utt1	B	Swimming one day .

sv	71 utt1	A	It adds up.
	aa	72 utt1	B	Yes.

sv^r	73 utt3	A	It is,
	sv	74 utt1	B	But you know, if they're going to be in daycare then they need to have some activities other than just being there.

b	75 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	qy	76 utt2	B	do you have two children?

sd	77 utt3	A	and the other one's two and a half,
	sv	78 utt1	B	Well they're expensive too. just the outgrowing of their clothes

aa	79 utt1	A	Yes .
	sv	80 utt2	B	so I'm sure the budget,

sd	81 utt5	A	and it does add up.
	b	82 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	85 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	86 utt1	B	Although the insurance we had was good, when Thomas was younger. A lot of the stuff had to be paid up front

sv	91 utt1	A	Well, that's, that's hard.
	aa	92 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	93 utt1	A	But I'm enjoying my stay home for the little time that I can .
	sd	94 utt1	B	I would too.

sd	97 utt2	A	and that's what's so sad
	sv	98 utt1	B	Well, you probably wouldn't want to do it forever.

qy	1 utt2	A	do you have any pets?
	ny	2 utt1	B	Yes,

b	3 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	4 utt1	B	but I had to replace it with something that the kids could carry.

b	5 utt1	A	Oh .
	b	6 utt1	B	Yes.

bf	7 utt1	A	Instead of being carried .
	aa	8 utt1	B	Yes,

b	11 utt1	A	Really.
	sd	12 utt1	B	so I called four or five dog trainers because I don't like the little dogs.

b	13 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd(^q)	14 utt1	B	and I asked them, you know, these are the ages of the kids, what do I get.

b	17 utt1	A	Huh.
	qy	18 utt1	B	Do you know what that is?

sv	19 utt3	A	They're cute.
	sv^m	20 utt1	B	They're cute.

b	21 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	b	22 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	23 utt7	A	She's like fifty five pounds.
	sd	24 utt1	B	Well, actually, you know, that's the breed standard for females.

qy	25 utt1	A	Is it?
	ny	26 utt1	B	yeah,

b	27 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	28 utt1	B	That is not breed standard.

b	29 utt1	A	Huh.
	sd	30 utt1	B	Fifty five is the minimum

b	31 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	32 utt1	B	You cannot show your retriever if it's, you know, a hundred plus pounds.

b	33 utt1	A	huh.
	ad	34 utt1	B	So don't say she's small, just say she's perfect.

sd	37 utt2	A	Well, she's got a brown nose instead of black too.
	b	38 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	39 utt1	A	Which makes her, I guess, unshowable, even if she had papers which she doesn't
	aa	40 utt1	B	Yep.

sd	41 utt8	A	and she was a lot of fun.
	sd	42 utt1	B	Well, they are the ultimate dog to have around kids so long as your kid is not scared of a big dog, because I had a retriever, actually I had a retriever Irish Setter cross. Which is a really nice animal

b	45 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	46 utt2	B	and fortunately it was just like a retriever

sd	47 utt1	A	I bet it had a pretty coat too.
	sd	48 utt1	B	It was gorgeous.

o@	49 utt1	A	Huh uh. * slash error Yeah. / * slash error
	sd	50 utt1	B	Since they've become so popular you get what I call backyard breeders. Which is probably where yours came from. People that don't know what they're doing, and they breed them, you know, for a certain characteristic.

b	53 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	54 utt3	B	when I bought my last purebred retriever I mean I looked all over because I wanted one that still looked like a retriever, you know, the short to the ground, stocky, golden, trainable, tractable, quiet animal that could hunt and still be in the house.

b	55 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	56 utt2	B	And I ended up getting one that, came out of a, a hunting stock because I wanted one that could still perform like a retriever did.

b	57 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	58 utt2	B	And I've seen an awful lot of lately really dumb, dumb retrievers

b	61 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	62 utt1	B	but I really figure right when it becomes really popular that it's going to be ruined.

sd	63 utt3	A	and I wonder since both of them are having them if it's some kind of breeding problem.
	aa	64 utt1	B	yeah.

nn	67 utt1	A	Huh uh.
	sd	68 utt1	B	It was bred out of several different retrievers,

b	69 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	70 utt1	B	But they selectively culled those litters, I mean, for many hundreds of years

b	71 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	72 utt1	B	On the other hand, you know, they sure created a wonderful breed, I mean a wonderful breed.

sd	75 utt4	A	we looked at some of the shepherd mixes and the puppies weren't very, social and stuff.
	b	76 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	77 utt4	A	And that, was mine.
	sd	78 utt1	B	Well, I tell you, you know the German shepherd is the classic case of what I'm talking about because in America that's called a Rin Tin Tin phenomena.

b	81 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	82 utt1	B	Only in America is there a dog called a German Shepherd.

bh	83 utt1	A	really?
	sd	84 utt1	B	That dog is bred out of three European dogs. The Belgian Tervurien, a German Skutzhund, and a , I always forget the third one. I can see it.

b	85 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	86 utt1	B	And there are distinct breeds in Europe.

b	87 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	88 utt1	B	And everybody wanted Rin Tin Tin.

b	91 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	92 utt1	B	That said anything that is a Skutzhund, a Tervurien and, that's the other one. Alsatian, any inner breeding of that can be called a German shepherd here.

b	93 utt1	A	Huh.
	sd	94 utt1	B	And what happened is, is that people wanted this shepherd to shepherd and protect.

b	101 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	102 utt1	B	And even, police corps which started, you know, finding other breeds to use because this, this thing known as a German shepherd here, its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible.

b	103 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	104 utt2	B	and it's the Alsatian that's the kid's dog.

b	105 utt1	A	Huh.
	sd	106 utt1	B	But you'll see,

b	107 utt1	A	Huh.
	sd	108 utt2	B	This is bred for,

ba	109 utt1	A	Wow.
	sd	110 utt1	B	Because they were looking for this disposition.

qy	2 utt6	A	Do you sew at all?
	ng	3 utt1	B	I used to,

bh	4 utt1	A	Did you?
	sd	5 utt1	B	I sewed, you know, in high school

b	6 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	7 utt1	B	And, my sister sewed

b	8 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	9 utt1	B	and then just in the last, you know, ten or twe , I just haven't sewn anything.

sv	10 utt4	A	and the quality is sometimes so poor that, it really is worth while to sew.
	b	11 utt1	B	Yeah.

aa	14 utt1	A	Right an,
	sv	15 utt1	B	now it's a little more expensive to make it, because, you know, you start paying the price for the patterns and the material,

b	16 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	17 utt1	B	but it's still such better quality that I think it's worth it.

sd	18 utt2	A	and the patterns have gone up tremendously, too, the prices for them, you used to could get, you know, a pattern for two or three dollars, now, they're like, you know, five, six, seven, eight.
	bh	19 utt1	B	You're kidding me.

sd^e	20 utt2	A	I'm not.
	sd	21 utt1	B	See I can remember paying seventy five cents for a pattern .

sd	22 utt3	A	the cheapest ones now are like maybe, four or five dollars, six, seven
	b	23 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	24 utt3	A	they get up into twelve and fifteen and, on like that.
	ba	25 utt1	B	Good night.

sd	28 utt3	A	I wish that I had started sewing, you know, when they were younger.
	b	29 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	32 utt2	A	and, I didn't like the way it looked so I'd never wear anything.
	b	33 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	34 utt3	A	and, it really makes it look professional
	b	35 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	36 utt2	A	and I've taken some classes here in, Dallas.
	sv	37 utt1	B	Well and that always is helpful for starters.

b	38 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	39 utt1	B	You know you have to have something that kind of gets you on the right track of where you're going.

sv	40 utt3	A	there's just so many people sewing now days.
	aa	41 utt1	B	That's true.

b	42 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	qy	43 utt1	B	Well do you do anything el ,

sd^e	44 utt2	A	I'm not that talented.
	sd	45 utt2	B	see, I've not ever been a real craft type person.

sd	46 utt2	A	I have a sister that can, crochet real well, or knit, I guess I mean knit.
	b	47 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	48 utt2	A	And she knits things like hats, and, sweaters, you know .
	b	49 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	54 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	55 utt1	B	and I asked my roommate if she would teach me how to crochet granny squares.

b	56 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	57 utt1	B	and I started crocheting a king size bedspread for a guy that I was dating at the time.

b	58 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	59 utt1	B	And when we broke things off,

ba	60 utt1	A	my goodness.
	sd	61 utt1	B	One of these days I keep thinking I'm going to finish it because it would make a really pretty bedspread .

sd	62 utt2	A	now they have the, knitting machines that will do it for you.
	bf	63 utt1	B	Fast .

qy	68 utt1	A	Are you familiar with what a Serger is, the Serger Sewing Machine?
	ng	69 utt1	B	I don't think so.

sd	70 utt2	A	and then we'd finish the edges,
	b	71 utt1	B	Sure.

sd	72 utt1	A	and we would, trim the seams and finish the edges.
	b	73 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	74 utt1	A	Well, this machine does it all in one step.
	bh	75 utt1	B	You're kidding,

sd	76 utt4	A	and it cuts off the, you know excess seam allowance.
	sv	77 utt1	B	Well that takes all the work out of it.

sv	80 utt1	A	And, it really makes it look professional.
	ba	81 utt1	B	Well, how neat.

sd	82 utt2	A	and it doesn't really,
	b	83 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv^r	84 utt1	A	But, the Serger really makes it look professional.
	ba	85 utt1	B	Well that's neat.

sd	86 utt3	A	I paid like about eight hundred dollars for mine,
	b^m	87 utt1	B	For the machine,

aa	88 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	b	89 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	90 utt1	A	So, since I bought it and paid that much for it, I guess I'd might as well get some use out of it.
	bf	91 utt1	B	You have to learn how to do it.

sd	92 utt2	A	I'm going to have to do it.
	qy^g	93 utt1	B	Otherwise, they hold it over your head forever, right .

na	94 utt1	A	Right.
	^q	95 utt1	B	Now I bought you that machine .

b	98 utt1	A	Yeah.
	qy	99 utt1	B	Do you paint or anything like that?

nn	100 utt1	A	No.
	bf	101 utt1	B	Never.

sd	102 utt2	A	I play the piano.
	sd	103 utt1	B	so do I.

bf	104 utt1	A	you do.
	sd	105 utt3	B	well I have one here,

b	106 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	107 utt1	B	and my folks gave it to me,

b	108 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	109 utt1	B	So, I'm not great,

sd	110 utt5	A	and, I played for the choral club in high school
	b	111 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	112 utt3	A	and, you know, you get rusty.
	aa	113 utt1	B	You do,

sd	114 utt2	A	but I'm rusty now.
	sd	115 utt1	B	Well, I figure it takes practice

b	116 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	117 utt1	B	By the time I put my kids in bed at night, I don't want to do anything.

b	118 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	119 utt1	B	you know, I've worked all day

b	120 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	121 utt1	B	I don't want to do them sometimes,

b	122 utt2	A	right.
	sd	123 utt1	B	So, I try to save that for the weekend.

sv	124 utt1	A	Well, sewing does take an awful lot of time, takes an awful lot of time.
	sd	125 utt1	B	Now the part about sewing that I never liked was laying out the material and the pattern and cutting it out.

b	128 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	129 utt1	B	and my mom wanted some pants,

b	130 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	131 utt1	B	But I hate laying out material and trying to get the most out of the material and, make sure it's on the right lines and not on the bias.

^2	132 utt2	A	on the, right on the straight grain, and all that stuff,
	aa	135 utt1	B	Yes,

sd	138 utt2	A	that's, that's the part that I don't like, too.
	b	139 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	140 utt5	A	even the cutting I don't like.
	qw	141 utt1	B	Well what are some of the other features on this machine?

sd	142 utt2	A	it has four threads instead of, the regular basic two threads.
	bk	143 utt1	B	okay.

sd^e	146 utt2	A	you can either use three or four of the threads.
	bk	147 utt1	B	okay.

sd	148 utt3	A	and it's the loopers that form the edge, you know that edge finish.
	b	149 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	150 utt4	A	and, you can use all kinds of different, textures of thread.
	bf	151 utt1	B	So it has the ability to do just about any type of sewing you want to do.

sd	152 utt4	A	you, you need it to do things like button holes, and, seams that need to be done on the sewing machine.
	b	153 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	158 utt5	A	but there are other things that a regular sewing machine does that it doesn't do. Like you can't top stitch with it.
	bk	159 utt1	B	okay.

sd	160 utt3	A	It will also do a rolled edge,
	b	161 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	162 utt1	A	Gee, it's just so versatile,
	sd	163 utt1	B	Well I'm going to have to go check it out.

qw	1 utt2	A	What part of the country are you in?
	sd	2 utt1	B	boy, this is going to be tough, I'm in Plano .

ad	3 utt1	A	Well, we can, complain together or swear we can complain together about the humidity .
	aa	4 utt1	B	Exactly.

ng	5 utt3	A	I wouldn't think,
	qw	6 utt2	B	what part of Dallas are you from?

sd	7 utt1	A	Far north Dallas .
	b^m	8 utt1	B	north Dallas.

sd	9 utt2	A	about a half a mile from Plano .
	ba	10 utt1	B	Well, jeez.

sd	11 utt1	A	So we're in the,
	qy^d	12 utt1	B	Well then you've been getting quite a bit of rain also.

sd^e	13 utt2	A	it's been very, very rainy, I know.
	bh	14 utt1	B	How about that.

sd	15 utt4	A	and when we first lived here, we were in Garland, East Richardson, and, doesn't seem like it was quite as humid.
	b	16 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	19 utt4	A	but, it's a lot colder too.
	b	20 utt1	B	Huh.

sd(^q)	21 utt2	A	so, said, Here, here's a g ,
	bh	22 utt1	B	How about that.

^q	23 utt2	A	here we are again.
	ba	24 utt1	B	That's great.

sd	25 utt3	A	but, I just don't remember the humidity.
	b	26 utt1	B	Right.

sd	29 utt3	A	Actually, though, it was a lot rainier here in the winter, we came back last August.
	b	30 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	31 utt1	A	It's just a lot rainier than I remember it, all through the seasons, you know.
	b	32 utt1	B	Sure.

sv	35 utt3	A	I really do think that's part of it.
	b	36 utt1	B	Huh.

sv	37 utt2	A	It's just like down here, when people here think it's a hundred and six, people up north think it's a hundred and sixty down here.
	b^m	38 utt1	B	A hundred and sixty.

sd	39 utt2	A	I'm making that up.
	b	40 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	41 utt1	A	You know, when it's only like ninety five.
	b	42 utt1	B	Sure.

sv	43 utt1	A	it's just like up there, when you hear it's forty below, it's probably really only five below.
	b	44 utt1	B	Right.

sd	45 utt2	A	well, probably what Arizona used to be like, you know, it's just dry and cool,
	b	46 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	47 utt2	A	so it's not what you think it is.
	aa	48 utt1	B	True.

qw	51 utt2	A	Where did you move here from?
	sd	52 utt1	B	Colorado.

sv	53 utt2	A	you could talk about that's, that's a strange state for,
	aa	54 utt1	B	sure, I'm I'm very familiar,

bk	57 utt1	A	there you go, okay.
	sd	58 utt1	B	So, I'm, quite familiar with how it is up there,

aa	59 utt1	A	This is very true.
	sd	60 utt1	B	And it's always snow, you know,

sd	61 utt3	A	well actually, the summers up there, we thought, were the most beautiful time of the year.
	aa	62 utt1	B	yes.

sd	65 utt5	A	and that's probably one of the stranger things, when you see the air inversions, and then you go into the mountains
	b	66 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	67 utt3	A	and it just was a very mixed bag in terms of Colorado.
	aa	68 utt1	B	sure.

bh	69 utt1	A	Isn't that strange?
	sd	70 utt1	B	So it's pretty amazing, it can be that drastic in just a short distance .

qy	71 utt3	A	are there tornadoes in Colorado, yes or n , I don't,
	na	72 utt1	B	it's getting to be more and more of a possibility.

b	73 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	74 utt1	B	It used to be no problem, just because it was such a rugged terrain and with trees everywhere,

sd	77 utt4	A	in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, they've even had, I'm going to say, mini tornadoes for lack of a better word.
	b	78 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	79 utt2	A	That was unheard of, you know, twenty years ago.
	b	80 utt1	B	Right.

sd	81 utt1	A	so I don't know what's happening, if it's, you know, we are, the greenhouse, I don't really know.
	aa	82 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	85 utt5	A	it just seemed a little bit more pleasant in terms of the atmosphere, you know.
	aa	86 utt1	B	Sure,

fc	87 utt1	A	You too.
	fc	88 utt1	B	Good bye .

fc	89 utt1	A	Okay.
	fc^r	90 utt1	B	Good bye.

sv	1 utt2	A	Well in Atlanta, Georgia you probably have a lot more crime than we have here in Patterson, California.
	am	2 utt1	B	could be.

sd	3 utt1	A	this little city is only about eight thousand people.
	b	4 utt1	B	Huh.

sd	7 utt3	A	But like, I lived in Oakland, until just recently
	b	8 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	9 utt1	A	and, Oakland, California, God, they've had like, sixty seven murders so far this year compared to like, forty at this time last year.
	b	10 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	11 utt1	A	So it's really bad there.
	b	12 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	13 utt1	A	and it's all related to drugs it seems like.
	b	14 utt1	B	yeah.

qy	15 utt1	A	Is that what it's there too?
	ny	16 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	17 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	18 utt2	B	I came from a smaller town in New York

b	19 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	20 utt1	B	and the city was fairly big size or not real big

b	21 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	22 utt1	B	every night the news is very depressing because they run down the list of how many people were shot, you know, drive by shootings or whatever

b	23 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	24 utt2	B	and it, it's pretty bad.

sd	25 utt2	A	Like I don't know what they can do to make it better unless they just hire more policemen.
	sd	26 utt1	B	Well that seems to be what they were doing

b	27 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	28 utt2	B	but, you know, it's very difficult.

b^r	29 utt2	A	uh huh.
	sv	30 utt2	B	and you know, the more, less that's done about it the more it seems it tends to spread into smaller areas unfortunately.

sv	33 utt2	A	Well I think that if they would do something to these people that they do catch instead of just slapping their little hands
	b	34 utt1	B	Right.

sv	35 utt2	A	and they would not do these bad things, you know.
	aa	36 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	37 utt3	A	Because, you know, like in other countries, man, I mean, they're really a lot stricter than we are.
	aa	38 utt1	B	Yeah.

b^r	39 utt2	A	uh huh.
	h	40 utt1	B	But I don't know.

b^r	41 utt2	A	uh huh.
	sv	42 utt1	B	But it seems, I mean,

b	43 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	44 utt1	B	and you know, something has to be done but just that too many people argue about how to fix it.

sd	45 utt2	A	I know when I lived in Oakland, it was just that, like, I definitely wouldn't go into certain areas of the city by myself.
	aa	46 utt1	B	sure.

sd	47 utt1	A	and then again some areas I wouldn't go by myself after dark you know.
	b	48 utt1	B	Right.

sd	51 utt1	A	But down here, in Patterson, well like I say, it's so small that you can go anywhere.
	b	52 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	55 utt1	A	But just, like twenty miles away see in Modesto, they have, those gangs and things over there.
	b	56 utt1	B	Right.

sd	57 utt2	A	In Sacramento also, they have, drive by shootings it seems like all the time.
	b	58 utt1	B	Yeah.

h	59 utt1	A	So, I don't know.
	b	60 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	61 utt1	A	I just don't know what they can do you know.
	aa	62 utt1	B	Yeah.

aa	63 utt1	A	I know.
	sv	64 utt1	B	And that's just ridiculous

sd	65 utt3	A	I know we've had this one lady that was attacked, you know.
	b	66 utt1	B	Right,

sv	67 utt1	A	I mean, you just, you just don't know what to do anymore, you know.
	b	68 utt1	B	Right.

sd	69 utt2	A	so it's not always happening at dark.
	b	70 utt1	B	Yeah.

h	71 utt1	A	So I don't know.
	aa	72 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	1 utt1	A	Carolyn, I have a little miniature Schnauzer.
	b	2 utt1	B	Oh.

qw	3 utt1	A	What do you have?
	sd	4 utt1	B	Well, it's kind of a mixed breed that we got from the Humane Society .

sd	5 utt4	A	it's part, Doberman and part Husky .
	ba	6 utt1	B	my.

sd	9 utt5	A	and being single, she's become very important in my life
	b	10 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	11 utt1	A	it's so nice to come home and find something, or someone who's really so happy to see you.
	sd	12 utt1	B	Well, my children are the ones that wanted our pet,

sd	13 utt2	A	and I'm not home
	b	14 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	15 utt1	A	and unfortunately she's not as well trained as I would like her to be
	b	16 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	17 utt2	A	I'm not doing a really great job as a disciplinarian,
	sv	18 utt1	B	It's hard to do that when you're not there constantly,

sd	21 utt2	A	and, not one mess does she make
	b	22 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	25 utt1	A	I just want to kill her at those times.
	b	26 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	27 utt4	A	she really is.
	sd	28 utt1	B	About the only time we have,

sd	29 utt4	A	and then, course, when my children were growing up, we always had a dog, and always said it was because the children wanted the pet
	b	30 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	31 utt1	A	and I find that I'm enjoying this one far more than I ever did when it was the children's dog,
	b	32 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	33 utt1	A	in fact my children gave me this little puppy for Christmas.
	ba	34 utt1	B	What a cute idea.

sd	35 utt2	A	I think so .
	sd	36 utt1	B	Well, we got one one year for Christmas,

ba	37 utt1	A	my goodness.
	sd	38 utt1	B	and, so that one wasn't really well trained .

b	41 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	42 utt1	B	I just didn't have time to take care of baby and train puppy at the same time,

sv	43 utt1	A	that is really probably bad timing.
	aa	44 utt1	B	Yeah,

ba	45 utt1	A	yes,
	sd	46 utt2	B	and that was fun,

sv	51 utt2	A	when you set a rule you have to stand by it, and be consistent
	aa	52 utt1	B	That's right.

fp	1 utt2	A	Amy, how are you doing today?
	fp	2 utt1	B	Fine,

sd^t	3 utt2	A	I think we know what we're going to speak about.
	b	4 utt1	B	Yeah.

qw	5 utt2	A	How's that?
	aa	6 utt1	B	Okay,

sv	7 utt1	A	I personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're talking about criminals, criminal cases that they should bring back hangings on weekends, in public places.
	b	8 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	11 utt2	A	There is one state that does that, by the way.
	bh	12 utt1	B	Really?

sd	15 utt1	A	They don't do them real often. Which is obviously the death penalty.
	b	16 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	19 utt2	A	and let's just screwing up the system.
	b	20 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv^r	23 utt1	A	That's pathetic.
	sd	24 utt1	B	Because they just say there's either no room in the system, you know, in the jails for them

aa	25 utt1	A	This is true,
	sv	26 utt1	B	You know, it's crazy.

sd	27 utt2	A	If it's life and a day, then he's not eligible for parole.
	b	28 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	29 utt2	A	let's quit B S ing with the system.
	sd	30 utt1	B	Well even if it's life, like you say, we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some, you know, joker in there for life.

aa	31 utt1	A	Exactly.
	sv	32 utt1	B	So to me if somebody has life, you know, beyond a reasonable doubt that should be it.

bf	33 utt1	A	A life for a life.
	sv	34 utt1	B	You know particularly for some of these really, I mean,

sv	35 utt2	A	I mean the guy just shouldn't be allowed to even live.
	aa	36 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	39 utt1	A	about the issue about sentencing by the judge.
	b	40 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	41 utt5	A	he was a veterinarian, and killed two, a father and a son, okay.
	aa	42 utt1	B	Right,

sd(^q)	43 utt6	A	there's a certain percentage of the people there, with seventy percent of the people said, hey, they guys guilty.
	b	44 utt1	B	Right.

aa	47 utt1	A	Exactly.
	sv	48 utt1	B	And the victims, you know, the family of these people that have been murdered, they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution.

bf	49 utt2	A	because it's not next day they have, the, start the trial, it's X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more.
	aa	50 utt1	B	Right,

sv	51 utt2	A	and let's just get on with the program.
	aa	52 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	53 utt1	A	But as far as the sentencing by the judge, I would have to vote against that since there is a jury, because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision.
	aa	54 utt1	B	Yeah,

qo	55 utt1	A	what are your feelings?
	sd	56 utt2	B	I saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge, I believe from Florida,

o	61 utt1	A	Well give me a break, you know.
	sv	62 utt1	B	He'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he's got his peers or something,

sv	63 utt8	A	you'd have to be pretty dense,
	b	64 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	65 utt1	A	you'd either have to be in a cave not to know what's going on, or moving it to Lubbock, or somewhere, possibly is not the answer.
	b	66 utt1	B	Yeah.

aa	69 utt1	A	This is true, so true.
	b	70 utt1	B	Yeah,

bf	73 utt1	A	So, you're at the house you're not at the plant.
	aa	74 utt1	B	No,

sd	75 utt4	A	but I wasn't sure.
	aa	76 utt1	B	yeah,

co	77 utt2	A	well, I'll let you get,
	aa	78 utt1	B	Okay,

qr	1 utt2	A	what are you, in favor or no comment?
	sd	2 utt1	B	I'm very much in favor of gun control.

qy^d	3 utt1	A	you are?
	ny	4 utt1	B	Yes

sv	5 utt1	A	Well, this should be very interesting, because I'm against it.
	sd	8 utt1	B	I don't mind people owning guns,

sd	9 utt1	A	Well, you know, now here's something that, first occurred to me when they started having all these problems with these automatic, weapons.
	b	10 utt1	B	Yes.

sd	11 utt1	A	now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic weapons.
	sd	12 utt1	B	I believe that's correct,

sv	13 utt1	A	And, yet, the gun control enthusiasts are, preaching about the gun control and how we should have stronger laws and what not.
	b	14 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	15 utt1	A	I don't understand why we don't enforce the laws we have.
	sv	16 utt1	B	That would certainly help,

sd	17 utt2	A	this is a federal law, controlled by the Treasury Department. for fully automatic weapons.
	b	18 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	23 utt1	A	And, all right, now for instance, in California where they passed the semiautomatic
	b	26 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy^d	27 utt2	A	The military version, attack weapons, or something?
	ny	28 utt1	B	Yeah,

qw	29 utt2	A	how is that going to affect the, sports weapons? I mean, rifles, that are automatic or semiautomatic?
	b	30 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	33 utt2	A	well, now, I've got to admit I'm inclined to agree with you there even though I am a member of the N R A,
	b	34 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	37 utt1	A	and they, their reason being that well, if you let one little law get through, pretty soon one's going to stack up on top of another, and so forth and so on.
	b	38 utt1	B	Right.

ad	41 utt1	A	And you've got to admit that Congress does kind of look at things that way.
	aa	42 utt1	B	Uh huh,

qy	45 utt2	A	now did you hear about the control that they have up in Virginia?
	no	46 utt1	B	I'm not sure I have.

sd	47 utt4	A	Anyone ever convicted of a felony cannot purchase a weapon.
	b	48 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	49 utt1	A	and they don't have a waiting period, because they have access to computer records concerning all these felons.
	b	50 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	51 utt4	A	and you get your gun right then and there.
	b	52 utt1	B	I see.

sd	53 utt1	A	but they are the only state that does it.
	ba	54 utt1	B	that's interesting.

sd	55 utt1	A	And, according to Virginia, it didn't cost all that much.
	b	56 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	57 utt1	A	and frankly, I don't understand why a state doesn't have those records available anyway.
	b	58 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	59 utt1	A	at least records of, known felons which are available to local police departments.
	aa	60 utt1	B	yeah,

sd	65 utt1	A	certainly those records are available,
	b	66 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	67 utt1	A	and all they would have to do is expand it. To, well, connect them into a modem somehow.
	aa	68 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	71 utt2	A	and they managed to squeak out a few bucks to do it.
	aa	72 utt1	B	Yep,

sd	73 utt1	A	And, it's, one hundred percent successful.
	ba	74 utt1	B	that's interesting.

sd	75 utt2	A	I just heard about this last week.
	b	76 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	77 utt1	A	they were bragging about it,
	b	78 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	79 utt2	A	they should have, have pride in this because it's a good system,
	aa	80 utt1	B	Absolutely.

sd	81 utt1	A	and it's working well.
	aa	82 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	83 utt1	A	And they don't need that seven day waiting period.
	b	84 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	85 utt1	A	Because the whole idea of that waiting period was, so that, the police could check up on you.
	b	88 utt1	B	Yep.

sv	89 utt2	A	those files are going to back up on somebody's desk, just some of that typical bureaucratic work.
	b	90 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	91 utt1	A	that's another, thorn in my side, bureaucratics, politicians.
	b	92 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	97 utt1	A	So anyway well, we seem to be one in favor and one against.
	aa	100 utt1	B	yeah,

sv	101 utt1	A	Although neither one of us are, really dyed in the wool.
	b	104 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	105 utt1	A	well, there should be some way of checking,
	b	106 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	107 utt1	A	now here in Texas, all you need is a driver's license.
	b	108 utt1	B	Right.

sd	109 utt1	A	And, even felons can still get a driver's license.
	b	110 utt1	B	Sure,

sv	111 utt2	A	well, they're not rigid enough here, in Texas.
	aa	112 utt1	B	Yeah,

ad	113 utt1	A	But don't tell the N R A I said that.
	aa	114 utt2	B	I promise.

sv	115 utt1	A	They're liable to tear up my membership.
	b	116 utt1	B	Okay,

qy	117 utt1	A	You say you retired a year ago?
	ny	118 utt1	B	Yes,

sd	119 utt1	A	I'm looking forward to it in about just over a year, myself.
	b	120 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	123 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	124 utt1	B	I do not quite a lot,

sd	125 utt2	A	Well, I bought a motor home here four years ago
	b	126 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	129 utt1	A	and I'm looking forward to just traveling.
	b	130 utt1	B	Sure,

sd	131 utt1	A	I have four sons scattered all over the country, and a few grandchildren.
	b	132 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	135 utt1	A	And I'm looking forward to just traveling around visiting them.
	ba	136 utt1	B	That'd be neat.

fc	137 utt1	A	Well Charles, good luck to you on your,
	fc	138 utt1	B	Okay.

fc^m	141 utt2	A	nice talking to you, too.
	fc	142 utt1	B	Okay.

fc^m	145 utt1	A	Take care now.
	fc	146 utt1	B	Bye bye.

b	5 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	6 utt2	B	I like the, idea.

qw	9 utt1	A	In what way are you talking about.
	sd	10 utt1	B	Well, I like the idea of voluntary support.

b	11 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	12 utt1	B	I mean they might be able to, say that anyone who does that, gets certain benefits that would not be available to someone who didn't do it.

b	17 utt1	A	Right.
	sv	18 utt1	B	The idea itself of service is good

sd	19 utt3	A	And I also thought that, that would interfere with college work.
	aa	20 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	23 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	24 utt1	B	You know, if someone were studying something, take something obscure. Somebody was studying economics, the State Department could offer to send them to the Soviet Union for two years to teach them how to run their country.

aa,o@	25 utt2	A	That's true. * Should be a slash unit Yeah / * See note above as an indep. slash unit this would be an 'ny'
	qy^g	26 utt1	B	As an extreme example, right?

qw	29 utt4	A	what year are they looking at?
	nd	30 utt1	B	Well, they're not.

b	31 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	32 utt1	B	And it's sort of a topic of debate.

b	35 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	36 utt1	B	And the people who are proconstitution oppose it on the grounds that the government shouldn't even have the right to enforce you to join the military unless the United States is actually under attack .

b^r	39 utt2	A	Right .
	sv	40 utt1	B	So, mostly, it's just kind of one of those things that goes away.

b	41 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd^c	42 utt1	B	They've got a noisy line.

sd^c	43 utt1	A	I thought that was your line .
	b	44 utt1	B	Yeah.

qw	45 utt1	A	what age group are they looking at?
	sd	46 utt1	B	eighteen.

b^m	47 utt1	A	Eighteen.
	b	48 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	49 utt3	A	normally that would interfere with college, I would think.
	co^c	50 utt3	B	Let me see if I can get on a cleaner line.

ad^c	51 utt2	A	Maybe that's part of it.
	b	52 utt1	B	Yeah

b	53 utt1	A	Oh.
	o	54 utt1	B	All right.

b	57 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	58 utt1	B	And, of course, this one the women would be equally grabbed

b	59 utt1	A	Right.
	ad	60 utt1	B	So, if you're near that age or you know somebody who is you know, be aware of that.

b	63 utt1	A	Yeah
	b	64 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	65 utt3	A	but I do have children to think about, you know.
	bk	66 utt1	B	okay.

aa	71 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	72 utt1	B	You know, we only find out about that a year after the fact.

b	73 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	74 utt1	B	So, it's another thing.

aa	79 utt1	A	I do too .
	sv	80 utt2	B	it seemed dangerous.

sd	81 utt4	A	Or he's in the Dallas area.
	b	82 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	83 utt1	A	And, he's very well known around here.
	b	84 utt1	B	Okay.

b	85 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	86 utt2	B	I have high hopes for him.

b	87 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	88 utt1	B	I mean in the Democratic primary, I'm going to vote for Brown just because I kind of like Brown and his attitude.

sd	89 utt4	A	So, there's a lot of people here pulling for him.
	b	90 utt1	B	Uh huh.

h	91 utt1	A	So. I don't know .
	b	92 utt1	B	Yeah

qy	95 utt1	A	did you work in the, computer business, is that what you said?
	ny	96 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	97 utt2	A	my husband works for, Texas Instruments.
	b	98 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd^t	99 utt1	A	And, so, that's how we found out about the Switchboard.
	b	100 utt1	B	yeah.

qy	1 utt2	A	Do you work?
	ny	2 utt1	B	Yes,

qo	3 utt2	A	What do you think?
	sv	4 utt1	B	Well, I think that's a big part of it

aa	7 utt1	A	That's right.
	sv	8 utt1	B	but yeah, I think that's a big change .

sd	9 utt1	A	Well, I've worked all the time up until just about a year ago.
	b	10 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	11 utt3	A	and I mean, I love my job.
	b	12 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy^d	15 utt2	A	I assume so.
	ny	16 utt1	B	Yes.

b	17 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	18 utt1	B	but as long as I w , you know, was going to work I was going to do as much as I could, as well as I could et cetera.

b	21 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	22 utt1	B	And I wanted to stay home when I had kids.

b	23 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	24 utt1	B	And we would like two more

bf	29 utt1	A	It's real hard.
	aa	30 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	31 utt2	A	I mean even I,
	sd	32 utt1	B	It's full time work.

sd	35 utt1	A	It was so hard for me to work full time.
	b	36 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	37 utt2	A	but then you give up the money.
	b	38 utt1	B	Yeah.

qy	39 utt1	A	You know?
	sv	40 utt2	B	of course, you know, everything you give up something

b	41 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	42 utt1	B	But I do think that's one of the major changes. {D You know,

sd	47 utt2	A	I know.
	sd	48 utt1	B	And if she worked it was part time

sd	51 utt1	A	Well, I've decided now in fact, I'm substitute teachers aid which is afar cry from my travel agent career, which I loved.
	b	52 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	53 utt2	A	But I'm there in the same school as my children, my two littler ones.
	b	54 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	55 utt3	A	and I'm just really hesitating, because I enjoyed the first summer home ever, like seventeen years with my kids.
	b	56 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	61 utt2	A	and it was wonderful.
	b	62 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	63 utt1	A	My kids and I, we just had a ball.
	sv	64 utt2	B	and I think,

sd	65 utt1	A	Of course, their ages, they are almost seventeen well, sixteen, fourteen, eleven, and nine
	b	66 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	69 utt1	A	and we are just running every direction
	sv	70 utt1	B	But see, it's such an important time to be home. You know.

aa	71 utt1	A	It is.
	sd	72 utt2	B	And that, was important to me enough,

aa^r	73 utt1	A	It is.
	sd	74 utt2	B	you know, my husband was raised,

b^m	75 utt1	A	Always worked.
	sd(^q)	76 utt1	B	and he's like well, you know, what's the big deal about being home, for your kids.

b^m	77 utt1	A	What, yeah.
	sd	78 utt2	B	Well, as our kids are getting older, you know, he sees it more.

b	79 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	80 utt2	B	or, she was there to take you,

b	81 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	82 utt2	B	and I want to be able to do those things

sd	83 utt2	A	You know, sometimes I'll have the cookies ready when they, come home
	b	84 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	87 utt5	A	I'm very happy to be staying home.
	ba	88 utt1	B	I think that's wonderful.

sd	89 utt1	A	But again I miss, the .
	qw	90 utt1	B	So, where do you see, us changing in the future?

sd	93 utt1	A	I don't.
	sd(^q)^t	94 utt1	B	Well, see that was one of the things the question I think is, you know, what changes do we see

o	95 utt2	A	Right.
	sd	96 utt2	B	and I'm not sure I see it go anywhere.

bf	97 utt2	A	If we want, extra clothes, the extra car, the extra,
	aa	98 utt1	B	Right.

sd	99 utt1	A	The thing is, when a woman does work, then there is the clothes to buy,
	b	100 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	101 utt1	A	and then there is the gas,
	b	102 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	103 utt1	A	and then there is the lunches and then the day care.
	sd	104 utt1	B	The day care eats, me alive.

sd	107 utt1	A	day care.
	sd	108 utt1	B	You know, I pay four hundred fifty to five hundred fifty, a month for two kids .

b^m	113 utt2	A	for two.
	sv	114 utt1	B	They would eat you, alive.

sv	115 utt1	A	It's almost hardly worth it for you, to work until they get in school.
	aa	118 utt1	B	I know.

qy	119 utt2	A	Are you a teacher?
	nn	120 utt1	B	No,

b	125 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	126 utt1	B	You know, so I feel good about them being there

b^m	127 utt2	A	It's not the same.
	sd^r	128 utt1	B	It's just not.

sv	129 utt2	A	and it's terrible for divorced women you know, who are forced to work who maybe don't have a college education.
	b	130 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd(^q)	131 utt3	A	and I could get a real good paying job, if I wanted to, you know, in fact, I still have offers, you know, please come back,
	b	132 utt1	B	Uh huh.

^q	135 utt1	A	and we'll pay you this .
	b	136 utt1	B	Sure.

sd	137 utt5	A	My kids, we've seen a remarkable difference in, now that I'm home.
	ba	138 utt1	B	That's wonderful.

sd	141 utt4	A	but I've been doing a lot of volunteering at the schools and playing lots of tennis .
	ba	142 utt1	B	I like that.

aa	143 utt3	A	I know .
	sd	144 utt1	B	Well, we're working on it.

b	147 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	148 utt2	B	I feel like, that's good

qy	1 utt2	A	do you, think we should go metric?
	no	2 utt1	B	Well, I, I don't know.

b	3 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	4 utt1	B	obviously, if it's all compatible and it, you know, tens

sd	5 utt4	A	I remember they tried it in the seventies at one point or something
	aa	6 utt1	B	Right.

sd	7 utt2	A	me too.
	sd	8 utt2	B	and they were ready,

sv	9 utt3	A	push, I, it, I bet the push just wasn't big enough.
	b	10 utt1	B	Right.

sv	11 utt2	A	so, you know, what I think they'd have to do would be to have both things on there for a while, and then start phasing things out
	sd	12 utt1	B	So I think that's what they did at first, was that they had metric

b	13 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	14 utt2	B	and I mean, and there's things that we've gone metric.

sd	15 utt2	A	I was just thinking, two liter bottles are what you buy and one liter bottles.
	sd	16 utt1	B	you can buy that

sd	17 utt2	A	You don't buy quarts and gallons anymore of soda.
	sd	18 utt1	B	you know, so that, we have little things that are metric,

^q	21 utt3	A	I went, a hundred kilometers. You know.
	b	22 utt1	B	Uh huh .

sd	27 utt2	A	I would be total loss.
	b	28 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	29 utt1	A	I think, though, if there were some, you know, sort of government incentive program or something people would begin to switch over, you know,
	b	30 utt1	B	Right.

sv	31 utt3	A	and, pardon my expression there, but, who would get really, you know, upset and start to complain and get all cranky and stuff.
	b	32 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	33 utt2	A	But I think in the end it would make life a lot easier for people coming up.
	aa	34 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	37 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	38 utt1	B	It would be difficult,

sv	41 utt1	A	Well, what I think the difference between now and then might be, this is just a might, is we were the first generation that was in elementary school.
	b	42 utt1	B	Right.

sd	43 utt3	A	you'd have, you know, two or three more generations that all now are familiar with the metric system.
	b	44 utt1	B	Right.

sd	45 utt4	A	and, I could handle it for a while, and then eventually I'd learn,
	b	46 utt1	B	Right .

sv	47 utt2	A	and I think that before, it was you know, just a bunch of little kids using it.
	b	48 utt1	B	Right.

sv	51 utt4	A	and we'll sort of deal with it, I think.
	aa	52 utt1	B	That's true.

sv	53 utt4	A	I mean, everything seems to be based on the same thing.
	sd	54 utt1	B	Well, I was trying to think of what kind of things you'd have to change,

b	55 utt1	A	Right .
	sd	56 utt1	B	When you wouldn't be five foot eight anymore, you'd be a hundred and seventy centimeters,

b^m	57 utt1	A	Centimeters.
	sd	58 utt1	B	and then you'd be lighter in kilograms than you were in in pounds.

sd	61 utt1	A	But I wonder if,
	sv	62 utt1	B	So all the dieters would be happy .

b	63 utt2	A	right .
	^q	64 utt1	B	I only weigh sixteen today.

sv	65 utt5	A	like from now on all licenses would have that, rather than going back and changing everything, you know, all new licenses as of nineteen ninety two would have it or something.
	b	66 utt1	B	Right.

sd(^q)	73 utt3	A	I know, though, at the amusement parks, they say if you're under forty two, inches or something. You can't walk in here.
	b	76 utt1	B	Right.

sd(^q)	79 utt3	A	see, what some of them is like, you know, they say if you're not taller than this line.
	aa	80 utt1	B	Right.

aa	81 utt1	A	That's right.
	^q	82 utt1	B	Just so you'll know,

sv	83 utt1	A	It would be a neat case where like, where kids taught the parents, I think, you know.
	aa	84 utt1	B	Right.

no	85 utt1	A	But I don't know.
	sd	86 utt1	B	I, I don't think they are, because our measurements started in England,

b	89 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	90 utt1	B	all that began back there,

sv	91 utt4	A	I mean, it seems like like, like, like sort of stupid.
	b	92 utt1	B	Right.

sv	93 utt3	A	and we're supposed to be, you know,
	^2	94 utt1	B	We're the trend setters in the world.

sv	95 utt2	A	and now we're backwards.
	h	98 utt1	B	I don't know.

sv	99 utt2	A	I, I would think, I mean, a, a base ten system as compared to a base twelve system makes a lot more sense.
	b	100 utt1	B	Right.

^h	103 utt3	A	let's see,
	sd	104 utt1	B	Well, pounds,

sd	105 utt5	A	I just sort of make it up.
	sd	106 utt1	B	See, and I don't understand liquid ounces and fluid ounces.

sv	109 utt1	A	those wouldn't be a problem.
	sv	110 utt1	B	It's not like it's really entrenched other, you know.

sd(^q)	113 utt3	A	I know things like, you know, a pint is a pound the world around or something.
	b	114 utt1	B	Right .

o	119 utt2	A	I promise.
	ba	120 utt1	B	Well, that's good.

sd	121 utt1	A	we opened a jelly bean business.
	b	122 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	123 utt3	A	we didn't bo , we didn't bother buying a scale.
	b	124 utt1	B	Right.

sd	125 utt1	A	We'd go out and just buy, you know, five pound bags of sixteen different flavors, put it in plastic shoe boxes and, and then sell them for x amount per pound or quarter pound or something.
	b	126 utt1	B	Right.

sd	127 utt4	A	and he got the measuring cup and just measured, I think a cup or two cup, whatever is a pint.
	qy	128 utt1	B	Did you ever check it to see if it really was, a pint?

sd	133 utt1	A	If anything, we were actually in favor of the consumer.
	b	134 utt1	B	Right.

sd	135 utt2	A	but that was our general tendency anyway.
	sv	136 utt2	B	you all are nice business .

sd	137 utt4	A	we really didn't, make, you know,
	b	138 utt1	B	Right.

sd	139 utt2	A	I think we were only making seventy five dollars each profit at the end of the year. You know, after an entire semester,
	b	140 utt1	B	Right .

sd	141 utt2	A	but we had a hell of a lot of fun doing it.
	sv	142 utt1	B	Probably ate all your merchandise too.

sd	143 utt4	A	and we had another friend, the physics major again, he wasn't he wasn't aware of jelly bean physiology, I guess,
	b	144 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	147 utt3	A	and some snow fell into one of the cartons.
	b	148 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	151 utt1	A	And basically what we had, sort of non coated beans at that point.
	aa	152 utt1	B	Yeah,

h	153 utt4	A	I don't know.
	b	154 utt1	B	oh.

o	1 utt1	A	Okay .
	b	2 utt1	B	Okay Carol.

sd	3 utt3	A	I know in here, downtown Dallas, I mean you drive by and you can see it.
	b	4 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	5 utt3	A	And, they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner.
	aa	6 utt1	B	Surely.

sd	7 utt2	A	And, of course, they don't have that here in Texas
	qy	8 utt1	B	You mean they don't have the smog alerts?

sd^e	9 utt2	A	not in Te , well not in Dallas, that is.
	b	10 utt1	B	Right.

sd	13 utt2	A	We're going there tomorrow.
	bh	14 utt1	B	really .

ny	15 utt1	A	Uh huh
	b	16 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	19 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	20 utt1	B	I was born in L A

sv	21 utt4	A	you do then.
	sd	22 utt1	B	the worst city in the world is actually, Mexico City.

qy	23 utt1	A	Is it really?
	ny	24 utt1	B	Yes.

sd	25 utt1	A	I would not imagine that.
	sd	26 utt1	B	The worst one for smog is Mexico City.

b	27 utt1	A	Huh.
	sd	28 utt1	B	The most polluted city in the world .

ba	29 utt2	A	You learn something every day.
	b	32 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	33 utt3	A	I've seen that.
	sd	34 utt1	B	some things they do, one of them is they're using corn in fuel.

b	35 utt1	A	Huh.
	qy	36 utt1	B	You ever heard of that?

nn	37 utt1	A	Huh uh.
	b	38 utt1	B	Yeah.

nn	39 utt2	A	No .
	b	40 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	43 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	44 utt1	B	that's one thing that they do.

b	45 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	46 utt2	B	unfortunately, it still contributes to global warming cause, you have to, you know, wipe out forests to grow corn and things like that.

aa	47 utt2	A	that's true.
	sv	48 utt1	B	It doesn't make sense.

^g	51 utt5	A	Right?
	ny	52 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	53 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	54 utt1	B	Drive cars with catalytic converters, and all that.

b	57 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	58 utt1	B	And, they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically,

b	61 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	62 utt2	B	So the engine kicks on when the batteries need power

b	63 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	64 utt1	B	Interesting thing about I mean, about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light, you're not using any energy .

ba	65 utt2	A	That is good.
	sd	66 utt1	B	Unlike a car where it's running.

b	67 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	68 utt1	B	A electric car it's on demand.

b	69 utt1	A	Yeah.
	o	70 utt1	B	Basically.

b	71 utt1	A	Huh.
	sd	72 utt1	B	You don't have to shift .

b	75 utt1	A	Oh.
	sv	78 utt1	B	Very interesting.

sd	79 utt4	A	maybe it was C N N where they were demonstrating that. Or something similar to that.
	b	80 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	83 utt1	A	Huh.
	sd	84 utt1	B	And Ford and General Motors and all those compete.

qy,am,o@	85 utt9	A	was that something * Seems to be an indep. slash unit maybe it was. / * See note above
	aa	86 utt1	B	Right.

h	87 utt2	A	I don't know.
	sd	88 utt1	B	G M, Chrysler announced that they're going to, they're,

br,o@	89 utt1	A	Huh? * Should have a slash Huh. / * See note above
	b	90 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	93 utt2	A	and they're very expensive too. .
	bf	94 utt1	B	To operate, yeah.

aa^r	97 utt2	A	Yeah.
	sv	98 utt1	B	Kind of interesting so see.

sv	99 utt2	A	Because if they want people to convert, you know. They should make it worthwhile.
	b	100 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	109 utt4	A	but some days it's very nice here downtown
	b	110 utt1	B	Uh huh

qy	111 utt6	A	Were you there at a?
	sd	112 utt1	B	I wasn't there too long ago.

sd	113 utt1	A	Cause I haven't been there probably ...
	qy	114 utt1	B	Well, you know, going over the hills, you know, coming into the valley? .

ny	115 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	116 utt1	B	You can see that horrible, horrible brown haze.

sv	1 utt1	A	Now then I think that
	b	2 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy	3 utt1	A	are you there?
	ny	4 utt1	B	Yeah,

qy	5 utt2	A	Do you have any one that has been in a nursing home?
	sd	6 utt1	B	well, only my grandmother, but for a very short time.

b	9 utt1	A	Yes.
	sd	10 utt2	B	physical therapy was there and whatever,

qw	11 utt2	A	I mean, what can we do,
	b	12 utt1	B	yeah,

sd	13 utt2	A	of course I'm old enough to remember when the family or the church took care of all of this.
	b	14 utt1	B	Yeah.

ad	17 utt3	A	no, you tell me how you feel about,
	b	18 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	23 utt1	A	I worked with an agency in West Texas it's where they really started this concept of Meals On Wheels
	b	24 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	25 utt1	A	and I think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly.
	b	26 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	27 utt1	A	If they didn't have to, you know, go into a kitchen
	b	28 utt1	B	Right.

sd	29 utt3	A	she didn't want to live with either my sister or me
	b	30 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	31 utt5	A	as long as mother was, you know mobile and got her food,
	b	32 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	35 utt2	A	and she was with people with whom she enjoyed.
	b	36 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	37 utt1	A	Sure.
	sd	38 utt1	B	But when the time comes, and she can't do things

ba	39 utt1	A	Yes, sir.
	sd	40 utt2	B	but if she wants to go to a meal, she can go down the hallway, to a room where there's a cafeteria

b	41 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	42 utt1	B	and there's other people there,

sd	43 utt1	A	Being a widow I find that eating alone is one of the hardest things I have to do.
	b	44 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	49 utt2	A	and I am finding it extremely hard to adjust to.
	b	50 utt1	B	Right.

sd	51 utt1	A	So, mother had the little kitchenette
	b	52 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	53 utt1	A	and she could do all these fine things that she just, had a microwave, had to pop her popcorn.
	b	54 utt1	B	Right.

sd	55 utt2	A	Now this is wonderful.
	b	56 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	57 utt1	A	But when it came time for a full meal, then mother was able to go with people and enjoy.
	b	58 utt1	B	Right,

aa	61 utt1	A	I think so.
	sd	64 utt1	B	I mean, see, I know that my grandmother would like to stay in her house,

sd	1 utt3	A	I'm in favor of it.
	sv	2 utt1	B	That doesn't necessarily mean you're controversial.

sv	3 utt2	A	but, I still feel that it could be a deterrent to crime. Particularly with the increase of serious crime that's going on now.
	sv	4 utt1	B	Well, I think that those crimes which are punishable by the death sentence, need to be reevaluated.

b	5 utt1	A	Okay.
	sd	6 utt1	B	I think there are other crimes that could easily draw the death penalty and not make me feel bad at all.

sv	7 utt2	A	I think,
	sd	8 utt1	B	Crimes against children is one of them.

sv	9 utt2	A	any crimes against person, I feel, there should be more than a slap on the hand, and being sent to prison and being released in, two or three years.
	b	10 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	15 utt1	A	yeah.
	sv	16 utt1	B	You know, if you kill, you lose your life.

sd	17 utt1	A	I don't see a thing wrong with that.
	b	18 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	21 utt2	A	I think there's, someone that's on trial right now here in the Dallas area,
	b	22 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	23 utt3	A	a young lady was killed sometime back, a young girl. A personal trial and the reporter was asking a stupid question of the people outside. / * Shouldn't the continued statement end after "A personal trial" and a new slash unit begin?
	b	24 utt1	B	Uh huh.

^q	27 utt2	A	Well, how do you feel about this?
	b	28 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	29 utt1	A	And, you know , how do they feel about it, I'm sure that, they want it over with / * Seems that a slash should be placed after "feel about it"
	b	30 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	31 utt2	A	and they want the person punished and punished, properly.
	b	32 utt1	B	Uh huh.

aa	35 utt1	A	Yes.
	sv	36 utt1	B	Innocent people could do that,

sd	37 utt2	A	Well, I feel like the cost of someone who's quoting figures made the cost, at like thirty thousand dollars, a year to keep someone in prison.
	b	38 utt1	B	 Uh huh.

sv	47 utt1	A	And, well, the problem there is they're not keeping the right ones in prison in many cases.
	b	48 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	49 utt1	A	There are more, and more instances being on the news,
	b	50 utt1	B	Sure.

sd	53 utt1	A	or this individual was out on the streets, on probation or parole and killed someone else. Or, seriously injured someone.
	b	54 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	61 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	62 utt2	B	I think then that a life sentence to restitution is appropriate.

aa	63 utt1	A	Yes.
	sv	64 utt1	B	I think he should spend the rest of his life working to support that individual or the family of an individual. who has been harmed you, you know.

b	67 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	68 utt2	B	People who kill policemen.

sv	73 utt1	A	Here again, anytime anyone goes out with a gun in their hand and crime on their mind the opportunity exists for someone to get killed.
	b	74 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	77 utt1	A	Now I'm not in favor of gun control to the degree or anything because, there are uses for guns which are noncriminal
	b	78 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	79 utt1	A	but it seems that the criminal element are the ones that are using them. aside from domestic disputes, husbands shooting wives or vice versa.
	b	80 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	81 utt1	A	But these individuals, if they have a gun with them, I think that the sentence should be even longer than if they don't.
	ar	82 utt1	B	I don't agree with the length, of the sentence though.

sd	83 utt1	A	Well, Well, but here again, if a matter of expediency, part of these costs like the people on Death Row is that their appeals can take years and years.
	sv	84 utt2	B	I think expediency is the answer.

sd	91 utt2	A	I know there's a law, I believe, that it's automatic appeal if it's a death sentence.
	b	92 utt1	B	Uh huh.

 sv	93 utt1	A	Well, I think that automatic appeal ought to take place, within a reasonable length of time, say six months.
	b	94 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	95 utt1	A	And a decision be made and not drag out in the courts for years, because of misplaced commas or whatever technicalities, there might be.
	b	96 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	101 utt2	A	there's got to be a, there's got to be a time limit.
	sv	102 utt2	B	you can appeal it once.

^2	105 utt1	A	a legit, legitimate appeal, not a technicality, of, if, they're not arguing that the guy or woman committed the crime.
	b	108 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd(^q)	113 utt2	A	They're arguing over, well, were his civil rights violated because, someone didn't file the proper paper at the proper time.
	b	114 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	117 utt1	A	Those are the things that have caused them to drag out I think.
	aa	118 utt1	B	That's right.

b	119 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	120 utt1	B	I mean, you know the guy is guilty.

bf	121 utt1	A	He didn't see his, lawyer as quickly as he should have, or some, some Mickey Mouse type thing like that.
	b	124 utt1	B	Uh huh.

aa	129 utt1	A	yes .
	sv	130 utt1	B	And, I just don't think that,

aa	131 utt1	A	Yes.
	qy^d	132 utt1	B	I hope you're not a lawyer .

aa	135 utt3	A	and I agree.
	b	136 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	137 utt1	A	We practice law ourselves because it's too expensive to hire lawyers, to a degree.
	aa	138 utt1	B	Absolutely.

aa	141 utt1	A	There you go.
	sv	142 utt1	B	But I really believe that our justice system is the best around

sv	143 utt1	A	Well, it's a case that we have a legal system which the criminals have found a way to use and a way to benefit them rather than the public itself.
	aa	144 utt1	B	That's right.

sv	145 utt1	A	So that's how we get caught in this, sort of a catch twenty two.
	aa	146 utt1	B	That's right.

sv	151 utt1	A	But you have to continue, to protect the innocent you're giving an open door to the guilty.
	aa	152 utt1	B	That's right.

b	153 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	154 utt2	B	that really does ruffle my feathers, at times.

aa	155 utt1	A	Yes . It does, most people.
	sd	158 utt1	B	I mean I can just get so, aggravated about it.

qw	1 utt2	A	where does she live?
	sd	2 utt1	B	on Rutherford.

sd	3 utt2	A	I don't know that.
	sd	4 utt1	B	It's, corner of New York just west of Mayfield.

sd	9 utt3	A	so our kids probably never went to school together or anything .
	bk	10 utt1	B	okay.

sd	13 utt1	A	well, I've got one in college .
	b	14 utt1	B	Oh.

o	15 utt1	A	By now.
	sd^t	16 utt1	B	Let's see, we're on government, whether we think it's honest or can be.

qo	19 utt2	A	What about you? .
	sv	20 utt1	B	I don't think under the way the system is right now, it is.

sv	21 utt3	A	even if people have good intentions, I think power corrupts or something to a certain extent, you know.
	sv	22 utt1	B	The ultimate power, ultimately corrupts.

sv	23 utt4	A	and a lot of corners being cut and the special deals available, because they're in on the know , you know .
	sd	24 utt1	B	I don't know if, there is enough money that you could pay them just, you know X amount of money to keep them honest.

b	25 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	28 utt2	B	I just don't,

o	29 utt3	A	you know what I mean?
	aa	30 utt1	B	Right.

sv	31 utt2	A	So maybe it's just man's nature .
	sd	32 utt1	B	here in Oklahoma we had a few years ago a major, corruption on our county commissioners

b	33 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	34 utt1	B	and there were several counties, including the one I was in, that lost every one of their county commissioners

qw	37 utt2	A	What were they doing taking some,
	sd	38 utt1	B	they were taking kickbacks.

ba	39 utt1	A	no .
	b	40 utt1	B	Yeah

ba	41 utt1	A	gosh.
	sd	42 utt1	B	Just a little here, a little there.

b	43 utt2	A	right .
	sd	44 utt1	B	Major amount here, a major amount there.

b	45 utt1	A	Right .
	sd	46 utt1	B	But I think there was something like, you know, thirty or forty commissioners that ended up going to jail.

sd	47 utt7	A	and I mean, that was our biggest scandal for the last few years, I think.
	sv	48 utt1	B	that's small scale.

sv	49 utt3	A	However, the things that have gone on in the last couple of years, we can't afford too many of those, you know, the the HUD mess or the S and L.
	aa	50 utt1	B	That's right.

sv	51 utt2	A	We could almost not afford such terrible corruption.
	sv	52 utt1	B	The cover ups and,

sv	53 utt4	A	and it kind of makes you feel bad that the top people in your country would be lying to you like that,
	h	54 utt1	B	I don't know.

b	55 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	56 utt1	B	I think that's what upsets me worse than, that they're getting a little, you know, on the side that, it seems that when they get up there it's if I vote your way, what it'll do for me rather, than this is the way my constituents want it.

sv	63 utt9	A	They need money so much, because they're constantly having to run, for office again.
	^2	64 utt1	B	run,

^g	69 utt4	A	don't you?
	sv	70 utt1	B	I don't think that anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government.

sd	71 utt6	A	some of them seemed like kind of, heroic people.
	sd	72 utt1	B	Well I wonder if they really were, or if we just really didn't,

o	1 utt1	A	Okay.
	fp	2 utt1	B	Hi.

sd	3 utt4	A	well, we like a lot of gasoline credit cards, because we like to be able to stop, you know, when we're traveling and stuff wherever there's a station,
	b	4 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qo	5 utt3	A	What about you?
	sd	6 utt1	B	I used to have a ton of gas credit cards,

b	7 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	8 utt1	B	and I don't drive that much.

b	9 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	10 utt1	B	But, as long as,

b	11 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	12 utt1	B	And so, I tend to buy almost all major purchases on a credit card, when I have the choice.

b	13 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	14 utt2	B	And, I used to even use it for my grocery shopping and stuff.

bh	15 utt1	A	really?
	sd	16 utt1	B	And so I don't.

b	17 utt1	A	Huh.
	sd	18 utt1	B	but it's not really a credit card .

qy	19 utt1	A	is it like an automatic debit
	na	20 utt1	B	it's a debit card,

b	21 utt1	A	huh.
	sd	22 utt1	B	And, just, you know, many times you get out of the store faster if you pay with that than if you pay with cash.

bh	23 utt1	A	really?
	ny	24 utt1	B	yeah.

sd	25 utt4	A	and then we just pay it off the next, month.
	b	26 utt1	B	Right,

sd	27 utt2	A	we don't like to pay interest on the credit cards at all.
	aa	28 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	29 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	30 utt1	B	And, you know, I'll forget to pay the bill by the due date,

b	33 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	34 utt1	B	And you know, so I thought I,

b	37 utt2	A	Yeah.
	sd	38 utt1	B	But they have no proof of that.

sd	39 utt7	A	and we had to finally mail them another check.
	sd	40 utt1	B	I had that hassle one time

b	41 utt1	A	Huh.
	sd	42 utt1	B	and months later they were still telling me that I owed them finance charges and, late fees and things like that.

sd	43 utt2	A	I don't either.
	sd	44 utt1	B	You know, kind of the ,

bf	45 utt2	A	you figure, you'll get your check back if you have to.
	aa	48 utt1	B	Right.

b	49 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	50 utt2	B	And, I mean you can't do that,

sd	51 utt2	A	I like to use my card if I buy something through the mail which I don't do real often or something from out of state, you know, where if something is wrong, you don't want to end up having to pay for it.
	b	52 utt1	B	Right.

^q	55 utt2	A	or I don't know what this is.
	aa	56 utt1	B	Right.

b	57 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	58 utt1	B	Well, that's basically what happened with us is we bought a computer,

b	59 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	60 utt1	B	We need to just put external cards in

b	61 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd(^q)	62 utt1	B	And then they said, well then don't pay it.

b	63 utt1	A	Oh .
	sd	64 utt1	B	But it's sort of, you know,

bf	67 utt3	A	if you filed that letter with them then they will kind of,
	aa	68 utt1	B	Right,

b	69 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	70 utt1	B	So I learned that for the next time.

sd	71 utt1	A	I'm like you, too, about the yearly fees.
	b	72 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	73 utt4	A	and since we don't pay the interest it doesn't really matter what the interest rate, is too, just as long as we don't have to pay that yearly fee.
	b	74 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	77 utt4	A	and those got so high we finally decided for him and me both to have a card it was like ninety dollars or something I think,
	b	78 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	79 utt2	A	but we decided let that one go
	sd	80 utt1	B	Well, my husband and I both have that

b	83 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	84 utt1	B	and I'm not quite sure what it is for him.

b	85 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	86 utt1	B	but, in the past you know, there are some places that only take American Express

b	87 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	88 utt1	B	and then they don't have the credit limit because I've over done the credit limit on the other card,

b	89 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	90 utt2	B	And, with the American Express they say there is no limit.

sv	97 utt2	A	like you said, if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff, it's more worth it.
	b	98 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	101 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	102 utt2	B	Because there are some,

sv	105 utt2	A	that wouldn't be too hard to do .
	b	106 utt1	B	Yeah,

qy	109 utt1	A	Have you ever run into problems of charging up more than you meant to and having to, be stuck with that?
	nn	110 utt1	B	No.

sd	111 utt2	A	We've never had, that problem either.
	nn	112 utt1	B	No.

b	115 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	116 utt1	B	and sometimes it comes in right away

b	119 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd(^q)	120 utt1	B	Because like many times I'll buy some things towards the end of the month thinking, hey, I won't get that bill until the next bill, not this bill.

b	121 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	122 utt2	B	And it will come in on the next one,

b	123 utt1	A	Yeah
	sd	124 utt1	B	But sometimes the is long .

sd	125 utt2	A	I guess it depends on whoever you buy it from how fast they turn them in or something.
	b	126 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	127 utt2	A	I guess they're called those pointed sale terminals where it's like it goes in the minute, you charge it.
	bf	128 utt1	B	Immediately.

b	131 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	132 utt1	B	but, that's what happened with us

b	133 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	134 utt1	B	and I got billed like the next day .

ba	135 utt1	A	gosh.
	sd	136 utt1	B	It didn't matter because we couldn't have paid for it by check

ba	137 utt2	A	that's nice.
	sd	138 utt1	B	You can, return it so like the washing machine we bought it in October

b	139 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	140 utt1	B	And somethings like that are,

sd	141 utt3	A	and the insur , like if you break it yourself even, you know,
	b	142 utt1	B	Right.

sd	143 utt1	A	if you buy something that's breakable.
	bf	144 utt1	B	Or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be

b	145 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	146 utt1	B	and so that's, you know, another advantage. And then even things like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which, hopefully you never use.

qy^d	1 utt1	A	so, you have children I take it?
	nn	2 utt1	B	No,

qy	3 utt1	A	You don't?
	nn	4 utt1	B	No,

bf	5 utt1	A	So, it's not a very valid topic.
	aa	6 utt1	B	No,

ny	7 utt1	A	yes.
	b	8 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	9 utt1	A	One.
	b^m	10 utt1	B	One.

sd	11 utt1	A	Stepdaughter.
	b	12 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	13 utt1	A	Ten.
	b^m	14 utt1	B	Ten.

qy^d	15 utt1	A	And, you know how they are at that age, I guess. you having been ten once, yourself.
	aa	20 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	21 utt1	A	we have one.
	qw	22 utt1	B	What kind is it?

sd	23 utt1	A	A Keeshonden.
	bh	24 utt1	B	really.

ny	25 utt1	A	Yeah,
	b	26 utt1	B	Uh huh .

sd	27 utt1	A	fuzzy little thing.
	br	28 utt1	B	A what?

sd^r	29 utt1	A	A fuzzy little dog.
	aa	30 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	31 utt2	A	he's fun.
	b	32 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	33 utt1	A	Anyway, time we spend with our children.
	b	34 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	35 utt1	A	It seems almost as though children hate it.
	qy	36 utt1	B	Do they?

sv	39 utt1	A	Time spent with Mom and Dad is probably one of the worst punishments spent on earth to them.
	aa	40 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	41 utt1	A	Yeah.
	h	42 utt1	B	I guess.

sv	43 utt2	A	parents are a curse that they just have to live with.
	b	44 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	45 utt1	A	So, it's interesting.
	b	46 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	47 utt1	A	But we do spend time driving in the mountains,
	b	48 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy	49 utt2	A	Do you work for T I?
	ny	50 utt1	B	Uh huh,

qy^d	51 utt1	A	You're working then?
	ny	52 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	53 utt1	A	With every passing day we wonder if we will be.
	sd	54 utt1	B	That's what I heard.

sv	55 utt1	A	it's better to be employed.
	aa	56 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	57 utt1	A	Especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner.
	aa	58 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	59 utt1	A	And that creates family tensions.
	aa	60 utt1	B	Yeah.

ny	61 utt1	A	Yes.
	qy^d	62 utt1	B	You all don't have any other children around there?

sd	65 utt1	A	I don't have any, children.
	b	66 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	67 utt2	A	but usually, Mom and Dad are a curse.
	b	70 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sv	71 utt1	A	You know, they'd much rather be with friends,
	ba	72 utt1	B	yeah .

sv	73 utt1	A	friends are cool, parents aren't.
	aa	74 utt1	B	No,

sv	75 utt2	A	well I'm sure part of it is a male, female thing, you know,
	b	76 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	77 utt1	A	I remember whenever I was growing up, often times spent with my Dad was, just wonderful, you know, go, go hunting, or go to the races, or, any number of things.
	b	78 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	83 utt1	A	And we'd have, great times,
	ba	84 utt1	B	yeah.

sd	85 utt1	A	and it seems that well now the bank's not available.
	b	86 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	89 utt1	A	and what if's always rough.
	aa	90 utt1	B	yeah.

sv	91 utt3	A	and, I don't know, little girls aren't interested in lot of the same things little boys are or were.
	b	92 utt1	B	Uh huh.

^2	95 utt1	A	Hunting and, Looking for arrowheads, and ...
	b	96 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	99 utt1	A	but they don't like it.
	aap	100 utt1	B	That's probably right.

sv	101 utt1	A	there, there is a difference there.
	b	102 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	105 utt1	A	Well, girls at that age, Video games, boys and malls.
	b	106 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	109 utt1	A	Not necessarily in that order, and friends of course.
	b	112 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	113 utt1	A	And, that's a little tough for fathers.
	aa	114 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qh	117 utt1	A	So, is that quality time?
	b	118 utt1	B	Huh,

sd	119 utt4	A	and we both enjoy that.
	b	120 utt1	B	Uh huh,

ny	121 utt2	A	yeah .
	b	122 utt1	B	Yeah

sd	123 utt2	A	and, that's somewhat fun.
	b	124 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qw	129 utt3	A	how would you spend time with kids?
	sd	130 utt1	B	Probably doing outdoorsie stuff, and trying to keep them away from the T V, I guess . And, McDonald's .

ba	131 utt1	A	yeah.
	sd	132 utt1	B	I always said that if I had a kid they wouldn't know what McDonald's is.

b	133 utt1	A	Yeah,
	sv	134 utt1	B	But , they learn from their friends,

sd^e	135 utt2	A	and amazingly a lot of times it's real easy.
	b	136 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	137 utt1	A	You know, a lot of times, whenever we head out of town on a trip or something, it's real easy to swing in there for breakfast.
	b	138 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	141 utt1	A	Breakfast and run.
	b	142 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	143 utt1	A	And breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway,
	aa	144 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	145 utt1	A	and, kids eat funny.
	sd	146 utt1	B	This lady in our bass club, we had a tournament yesterday

sv	147 utt1	A	And little girls are worse about it than little boys.
	b	148 utt1	B	Yeah,

aap	151 utt1	A	or something, yeah.
	b	152 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	153 utt2	A	to some extent the public schools, or the schools in general, influence them, the eating meat kick.
	b	154 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	159 utt1	A	You know, like it's really morally wrong to eat meat or something, I'm not sure.
	b	160 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	163 utt1	A	Of course, that's not the way I was raised, being raised in West Texas.
	b	164 utt1	B	Yeah.

ny	165 utt1	A	yeah.
	b	166 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	167 utt1	A	Born in Denton, raised in Lubbock.
	b	168 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	169 utt1	A	So, I understand about bass.
	b	170 utt1	B	Yeah

sv	171 utt1	A	but it is interesting,
	b	172 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	173 utt3	A	Every person out there should have kids, at least once or have some they can borrow for a time, because everyone needs some torture in their lives.
	sd	174 utt1	B	That's the kind I like.

sd	177 utt1	A	But, Jenny is a sweet kid.
	b	178 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	179 utt2	A	we do do things,
	b	180 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	181 utt2	A	it's almost like a lot of things that were available to us as children, to go do,
	b	182 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	185 utt1	A	The money's not available.
	aa	186 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	187 utt1	A	You know , we were talking about how much it cost to go to Disney Land.
	b	188 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	189 utt3	A	three hundred dollars.
	ba	190 utt1	B	yeah.

sd	191 utt1	A	You know, for just not in , you know, a day or two, not including lodging and food and all that.
	b	192 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	195 utt1	A	And, I understand Six Flags is real expensive now.
	sd	196 utt2	B	I heard it's twenty bucks a whack.

ba	197 utt1	A	yeah.
	b	198 utt1	B	Yeah.

b^m	199 utt1	A	Twenty bucks a whack now.
	aa	200 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	201 utt1	A	But, at least once you pay your way in there, at Six Flags ...
	b	202 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	207 utt1	A	So that's not as bad.
	b	208 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	211 utt1	A	You know, Disney World or Disney Land.
	b	212 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	213 utt1	A	Well, our problem is that, you know, a trip to Six Flags or Disney World or, Disney Land, or God forbid, Disney World, would take forever.
	b	214 utt1	B	Really.

sd	215 utt1	A	Or you'd have to pay air fare,
	b	216 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	217 utt1	A	and, ooh, you know, for a family it gets pretty expensive pretty quick.
	ba	218 utt1	B	yeah.

sd	219 utt1	A	Rent a car when you get there and all that.
	sd	220 utt1	B	That's why I lucked out,

qw	1 utt1	A	So, what kind of a house do you live in?
	sd	2 utt1	B	I'm in a ranch.

sd	3 utt5	A	but most of them now are up in the millions of dollars.
	bh	4 utt1	B	Really?

ny	5 utt1	A	yeah,
	qw	6 utt1	B	How many square feet do you have?

sd	7 utt1	A	We have got about, I'd say about twenty four hundred.
	qy	8 utt1	B	Four bedrooms?

sd	9 utt1	A	we've got five bedrooms, because we built onto our garage.
	b^m	10 utt1	B	Five bedrooms.

sd	13 utt1	A	a bedroom for my mother,
	sd	14 utt1	B	I made a fourth bedroom out of, made a fourth bedroom out of our living room and then added what we call a sunroom to get the, you know,

b	15 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	16 utt2	B	when we added four hundred square feet to our house

sd	19 utt3	A	and that's the thing I probably like the most about it.
	qw	20 utt1	B	How many stories?

sd	21 utt3	A	It's a Fox and Jacobs home.
	qw	22 utt1	B	How are they built?

sd	23 utt1	A	we've been real happy with it.
	b	24 utt1	B	Yeah.

^q	25 utt3	A	and this is under something
	qy^d	26 utt1	B	But I mean it doesn't give you trouble?

nn	27 utt1	A	No.
	b	28 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd^e	29 utt2	A	we haven't had a lot of problems with it at all.
	qy^d	30 utt1	B	No cracked slab or anything like that?

nn	31 utt1	A	No.
	bk	32 utt1	B	All right.

sd	33 utt1	A	We've been real lucky.
	sd	34 utt1	B	And is it, a natural gas and,

b	35 utt1	A	Yeah.
	qh	36 utt1	B	You know what I miss though?

ba	37 utt1	A	yeah.
	sd	38 utt1	B	I sure wish they could build basements in homes in Texas.

sd	41 utt2	A	but certainly not,
	qy	42 utt1	B	Can you stand up in it?

sd	43 utt2	A	I mean you really couldn't use it for a room.
	qy^d	44 utt1	B	So you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here.

ny	45 utt1	A	Yes.
	sd	46 utt2	B	ours is pitched so shallow that you, don't get much room in the attic.

sd	47 utt4	A	I'll store all our Christmas stuff and whatever else junk up there.
	bf	48 utt1	B	So, five bedrooms and two family t ,

sd	49 utt2	A	We have a living room and dining room at the front of the house,
	b	50 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	51 utt1	A	and then we have the, family room, kitchen, and playroom at the rear of the house which has been really nice.
	b	52 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	53 utt4	A	but of all the rooms in the house I'd say that was the one that's been really nice to have .
	qh	54 utt1	B	Isn't it funny how families end up living in one room in the house most of the time.

sd	57 utt2	A	Probably our family room is the biggest.
	b	58 utt1	B	Right.

b	59 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	60 utt1	B	I mean might as well not even heat and cool it.

b	61 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	62 utt1	B	Strange.

sd	63 utt1	A	Well, that's kind of the way our living room and dining room is,
	b	64 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	65 utt1	A	but it is nice to have it because with our size of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight and clean if you have someone come just on the spur of the moment.
	b	66 utt1	B	Right,

sd	71 utt1	A	Seventeen years.
	ba	72 utt1	B	Wow.

b	73 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	74 utt1	B	We've been fifteen years in the house that we're living in.

ba	75 utt1	A	wow.
	sd	76 utt1	B	And the principal feature I like about ours is that it's pier and beam.

b	77 utt1	A	uh huh.
	qy^d	78 utt1	B	Yours is a slab I assume.

sd^e	79 utt2	A	it is.
	b	80 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	81 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	82 utt1	B	I've done a lot of electrical and plumbing and other work by myself and saved a lot of money that I couldn't have done if the house was on a slab.

ba	83 utt1	A	Well, that's interesting.
	sd	84 utt1	B	But that's because it's so old.

b	85 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	86 utt1	B	It's thirty five, thirty six years old when they used to build like that,

sd	87 utt2	A	Well, my husband wouldn't do that anyway.
	aa	88 utt1	B	I know,

sd	89 utt1	A	worst thing in life is to have to repair something.
	sd	90 utt1	B	I, on the other hand, do a lot too much of it

sd^r	93 utt4	A	he does ,
	b	94 utt1	B	Right.

qo	1 utt1	A	What do you think about, the way the criminal justice system handles trials?
	sd	2 utt1	B	Well, you know, they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers

b	3 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	4 utt1	B	but, you know, it's pretty hard to try, let's say, the man down the street that's living on Social Security or somebody that's on a limited income to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people,

b	5 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	b	6 utt1	B	Okay

b	7 utt1	A	Yeah.
	b	8 utt1	B	Okay

b	11 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	12 utt2	B	But then there's another thing that I disagree with in Texas is sometimes you have a jury of six

b	13 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	14 utt1	B	And I don't know why they do that.

sd	15 utt2	A	and that's mostly to decide whether or not the person's actually going to stand trial.
	bk	16 utt1	B	Okay,

sd	17 utt1	A	Whether they're acquitted or whether they're actually going to be accused you know, and held over for trial.
	b	18 utt1	B	Okay .

sd	21 utt4	A	I know that judges aren't supposed to be crooked.
	sv	22 utt1	B	Well, we know there's a few out there.

sv	23 utt4	A	if, if the judge is not of high moral standards he could be bought off, much easier than twelve people could.
	b	24 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	29 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	30 utt2	B	and that's more money spent.

sd	31 utt1	A	It's not so much that, I haven't seen a lot of really bad sentences passed either by trials or by judges. What bothers me is that, they really don't mean anything.
	aa	32 utt1	B	No.

sv	33 utt3	A	and yet, you know, the parole system, it's going to let them out in three years for good behavior.
	sv	34 utt1	B	And it's not working either.

aa	35 utt2	A	it's not.
	sv	36 utt1	B	It seems that we have more and more repeat offenders.

b	37 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	aa	38 utt1	B	I know,

sv	39 utt1	A	I think they're all overcrowded.
	sd	40 utt1	B	And it's overcrowded.

qw	43 utt3	A	Now what are they supposed to do?
	sd	44 utt1	B	They turn them loose.

sd^r	45 utt2	A	I mean, they're not allowed to accept any new inmates.
	b	46 utt1	B	Yeah.

qw^r	47 utt1	A	So what are they supposed to do with people that they need to put in jail?
	sd	48 utt1	B	Well, it seems the way it's been working here's,

sd	53 utt2	A	and I really like the system of house arrest where a, someone wears a bracelet like a ankle bracelet that's a monitor,
	b	54 utt1	B	Yeah

sd	59 utt6	A	they're instructed, so that, this electronic monitor is turned on at, at a certain time
	b	60 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	61 utt2	A	and it connects them up to a system where they know their whereabouts.
	b	62 utt1	B	All right.

sd	63 utt3	A	and when the parole officer calls to check on them, they're instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it. So that they can see that this person is actually at home in their house doing what they're supposed to be doing
	b	64 utt1	B	All right.

sv	65 utt4	A	That allows people, to actually continue to be productive members of society while they're, you know, paying back for whatever crime they've committed.
	aa	66 utt1	B	Yeah,

b^r	71 utt2	A	yeah.
	sd^r	72 utt1	B	And that would give, you know,

sd	75 utt2	A	But, Something that I really don't understand is when someone goes to jail and they have a job in jail and they work, that they should,
	sv	76 utt1	B	Sometimes it's pretty messed up,

sv	79 utt5	A	I mean they're in jail for crying out loud.
	b	80 utt1	B	Yeah.

qh	81 utt1	A	What do they need cigarettes for?
	sd	82 utt2	B	and there's another thing about the justice system that I don't like

b	83 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	84 utt1	B	and when you're in jail, they take you out just like they do in Alabama or anywhere else, what they call a chain gang.

b	85 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	86 utt1	B	And they clean the city parks.

sv	87 utt1	A	I think that's a wonderful idea.
	sd	88 utt1	B	And they clean the city streets.

sd	89 utt1	A	More than that.
	b	90 utt2	B	yeah,

sd^r	91 utt1	A	More than that.
	sd	92 utt1	B	but I know families myself that have three and four children in Lubbock that don't make that much.

aa	93 utt1	A	I know.
	sd	94 utt1	B	And you know, they're not doing anything to support themselves, while they're there.

sd	95 utt1	A	The thing that, the thing that gets me is that while we're supporting them, they're working.
	b	100 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	101 utt1	A	When they get out of jail they get handed all that money.
	b	102 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	103 utt2	A	I think that while they are in jail and they are working, their wages should go,
	b	104 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	105 utt4	A	some percentage, like eighty five percent of their wages should go toward their room and board figured on a whatever basis how much it costs to actually support them for a year.
	b	106 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	109 utt1	A	And when they get out they should have I don't know, you know, some reasonable amount of money to start, like a couple of thousand dollars,
	b	110 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	111 utt3	A	Anything that they've earned while they're in prison should go back to the State except for that, you know, there needs to be some allowance for when someone gets out that they have some money to start with.
	aa	112 utt1	B	Yeah,

aa	113 utt2	A	absolutely.
	sd	114 utt1	B	And something else that I would, And something else that I would like to see is, victim reimbursement, you know, because they, you know, like you say these guys are in jail

sv	115 utt1	A	That's the part that I really think we need to change.
	sd	116 utt2	B	and they're working,

aa	117 utt2	A	right.
	sv^m	118 utt1	B	has nothing, you know.

aa	119 utt1	A	Absolutely.
	sv	120 utt1	B	they know how to deal with the penal system

b	121 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	122 utt3	B	I strongly disagree with any judge passing sentence on a person himself.

sv	125 utt1	A	I think it works much better if it's the actual jury.
	aa	126 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	127 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	128 utt1	B	the jury gets to see the whole trial, as does the judge,

b	129 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	130 utt1	B	Whereas the jury may have a little, shall we say, sympathy, you know,

sv	131 utt2	A	in some, cases it would work that way.
	^q	132 utt1	B	is there a basis for it.

sv	133 utt2	A	In some cases it would work the other way.
	aa	134 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	135 utt2	A	and, and I think that the jury probably has more of a right to sentence than the judge all the time.
	b	136 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	139 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	140 utt1	B	and you'd have more than one person's input on it.

sv	141 utt2	A	I think that's probably a much fairer way.
	sd(^q)	142 utt1	B	And, you know, we're supposed to be, and I quote, in a democratic society.

b	145 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	146 utt1	B	And a lot of jurors,

sv	149 utt3	A	but it would be a more responsible way to deal with it.
	aa	150 utt1	B	Yeah

qy	2 utt2	A	Do you work with a company that, gives drug testing ?
	na	3 utt1	B	Sort of.

bh	6 utt1	A	they do?
	ny	7 utt1	B	Yeah.

qy	8 utt3	A	did they do that before you went in or what?
	na	9 utt1	B	they do it before you go in

qy^g	10 utt1	A	they will, huh?
	ny	11 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	12 utt5	A	I don't work right now because my company I worked for, P I E, went bankrupt
	b	13 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	14 utt1	A	but, they was getting a program set up, that for all new hires they was going drug, give them drug tests.
	b	15 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	16 utt1	A	But, they didn't hire very many new hires because all the people that usually work there, you know, just stayed there because they had been there for a long, long time.
	b	17 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	18 utt1	A	But, actually, I think they should do it.
	aa	19 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	20 utt1	A	You know, I don't think anybody needs anybody to be working for them that's on drugs of any kind you know.
	b	21 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv(^q)	24 utt2	A	I think they should kind of warn them, like, you know, well we're going to do that or maybe tell them before they do get hired, you know that this is what is going to happen.
	b	25 utt1	B	Oh.

^q	26 utt2	A	And then if you don't like it, why then, you know, you'll have to go look for a job someplace else.
	sv	29 utt2	B	you have, to do randomly otherwise people will cheat.

aa	32 utt1	A	Well, I suppose you are right there too, you know.
	b	33 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	36 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	37 utt2	B	and then when that urinalysis came around they would be all scared.

b^r	38 utt2	A	Uh huh.
	sv	39 utt1	B	The only problem is, you know, if you have done drugs but you've stopped and, you do get caught, it is kind of harsh.

b	40 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	b	41 utt1	B	Yeah.

qw	42 utt2	A	Or what do they do with you guys if, that you guys get,
	sd	43 utt1	B	we get counseling

bk	44 utt1	A	I, I see.
	sd	47 utt3	B	I don't do any drugs

sv	50 utt1	A	I think anybody that does them are dumb, you know.
	bf	51 utt1	B	Crazy.

sv	52 utt4	A	and you just watch it on T V and see how it just burns your brain completely up, you know.
	aa	53 utt1	B	Yeah,

qy^g	54 utt2	A	really dumb, huh.
	ny	55 utt1	B	Yeah.

t1	56 utt1	A	But, . Let's see, what else was I going to say here.
	qo	57 utt1	B	what do you think about our, like, other government agencies testing?

sv	58 utt3	A	I think they all should test really you know.
	b	59 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	60 utt2	A	it just seems like there is so much more of it going on anymore that, I don't know what's wrong with the people,
	b	61 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	62 utt6	A	and and then you know, they'll get out
	aa	63 utt1	B	I know,

sv	64 utt2	A	and they're right back at it again.
	aa	65 utt1	B	Yeah.

b^r	68 utt2	A	uh huh.
	b	69 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	70 utt3	A	and I'll see what they do, you know.
	b	71 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	72 utt3	A	so they can test me all I want.
	b	73 utt1	B	Yeah.

qy^d	74 utt2	A	I wonder if you take medicine if that would effect it.
	b	75 utt1	B	see, that's,

qy^g	76 utt2	A	see now that that would be really unfair then, huh?
	sd	77 utt1	B	I've heard of that,

o	80 utt1	A	You know.
	sv	81 utt1	B	I believe you should have the testing

bf	82 utt2	A	Find out you know, if you have been taking some kind of medication and, you know, if that would effect it and everything.
	aa	83 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd^t	84 utt2	A	I think our five minutes is about up anyhow.
	fc	85 utt1	B	Well, it was nice talking to you Rose.

fc	86 utt2	A	and maybe I'll talk to you again.
	fc	87 utt1	B	Okay .

fc	88 utt1	A	Alrighty.
	fc	89 utt1	B	Bye bye.

qy	1 utt1	A	do you have a pet Randy?
	ny	2 utt1	B	yeah,

qr	3 utt1	A	A poodle, miniature or, full size?
	ny	4 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	5 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	b	6 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	7 utt1	A	I read somewhere that, the poodles is one of the most intelligent dogs, around.
	sd	8 utt1	B	Well, I definitely wouldn't dispute that,

qw	9 utt2	A	So, you've only known the dog, how long did you say.
	sd	10 utt1	B	Well, about a year I guess.

qw	11 utt2	A	how old is the dog?
	sd	12 utt1	B	It just turned two, I believe.

bf	13 utt1	A	it's still just a pup.
	aa	14 utt1	B	Pretty much,

sd	15 utt3	A	I call it a, Chowperd .
	b	16 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	17 utt4	A	So, she's a genuine Chowperd .
	ba	18 utt1	B	that sounds interesting.

sd	19 utt2	A	but, she has the shape of the, Shepherd.
	ba	20 utt1	B	that's neat.

sd	21 utt2	A	so she's a medium size.
	b	22 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd,o@	23 utt1	A	But she's big enough to be intimidating, * Seems that this should end in a slash since A's next turn is an indep. clause it is a fixed female, by the way, / * see note above
	aa	24 utt1	B	Most definitely.

sd	27 utt1	A	and right from day one, she was teaching me.
	aa	28 utt1	B	I wouldn't doubt it,

sd	29 utt2	A	Course, I'm a little prejudiced, of course.
	ba	30 utt1	B	Well that's understandable,

sd	31 utt2	A	And I spread the newspapers out in the kitchen area.
	b	32 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	33 utt1	A	But, next morning, she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom.
	b	34 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	35 utt2	A	and she used them there.
	b	36 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	37 utt1	A	But it wasn't too long until she, found out she could wait until I let her out in the morning.
	b	38 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	39 utt1	A	And since then, I live alone,
	b	40 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	41 utt4	A	and you can see her smiling from ear to ear, she's so happy to see me.
	aa	42 utt1	B	Yeah,

qy^d	43 utt1	A	And, I don't know if you get that kind of greeting or not.
	ny	44 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	45 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	48 utt1	B	She's definitely ready to get out and run around.

sd,o@	49 utt1	A	Well my dog's an outdoor type, she does not like to be indoors. / * 2 slash units?
	b	50 utt1	B	Really.

sd	51 utt1	A	she'd rather sleep outside on the cold ground at night.
	ba	52 utt1	B	wow.

sd	53 utt1	A	But, I do make her come in.
	b	54 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	55 utt2	A	but during the day I have her on a leash, which is, on sort of a run.
	b	56 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	57 utt2	A	I have a thirty foot cable, running from one stake to another,
	b	58 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	59 utt2	A	and then attached to that is a, twelve foot leash,
	b	60 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	61 utt1	A	so she can cover quite an area.
	aa	62 utt1	B	Most definitely.

sd	63 utt1	A	And, she's the best, burglar alarm going.
	aa	64 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	65 utt3	A	it's the strangest thing, though, children, no matter how strange they are, or how new they might be can walk, right up to her,
	b	66 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	67 utt1	A	but adults, if they're strange to her, or they look suspicious or something, boy she acts like she wants to chew their leg off.
	ba	68 utt1	B	Wow.

sd	69 utt1	A	And I have not discovered yet where the line is between children and adults.
	b	70 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	71 utt1	A	But, she is a great comfort to me.
	b	72 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	73 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	74 utt2	B	it's a matter of exposure really.

b	75 utt1	A	uh huh.
	sd	76 utt2	B	and, the dog kind of felt out of place then because she was being fed, and everything else from all directions.

bf	77 utt1	A	You mean she didn't appreciate all that attention.
	ar	78 utt1	B	She really did,

qw	79 utt2	A	What's her name by the way?
	br	80 utt1	B	pardon?

qw^r	81 utt1	A	what do you call the dog?
	sd	82 utt1	B	it's, Mitzi.

b^m	83 utt1	A	Mitzi.
	aa	84 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	85 utt1	A	Mine is Gin.
	bk	86 utt1	B	okay.

sd	87 utt1	A	As in, martini.
	b	88 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	89 utt1	A	Actually, it's Gin two.
	bk	90 utt1	B	I see.

sd	91 utt2	A	but then when I went out in the world, I couldn't take her with me.
	aa	92 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	93 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	94 utt2	B	And he was a real lovable type, but, definitely not an apartment type animal

b	95 utt1	A	yeah.
	sd	96 utt2	B	so he had to stay home.

by	97 utt1	A	what a shame.
	aa	98 utt1	B	Yeah,

o	99 utt2	A	well.
	b	100 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	103 utt1	A	and I must say it was interesting.
	aa	104 utt1	B	Most definitely.

sv	105 utt1	A	I enjoyed talking about pets with you.
	ba	106 utt1	B	Well that's great.

fc	107 utt1	A	Maybe we'll get together again in the future.
	fc	108 utt1	B	That sounds real good.

fc	109 utt1	A	Take care now.
	fc	110 utt1	B	You too.

qy	1 utt4	A	Have you done any recently?
	sd	2 utt1	B	Well, we, remodeled a bathroom. which required, completely repainting the bathroom,

b	3 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	4 utt2	B	and the other project we've done around here is, we've remodeled all our closets which required quite a bit of painting.

qrr	7 utt4	A	or did you do that yourself?
	nn	8 utt1	B	No,

qy	9 utt1	A	Did you enjoy that?
	ny	10 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	11 utt7	A	We were quite pleased with the result.
	qy	12 utt1	B	Is this a project you did yourself?

ny	13 utt3	A	yes,
	qw	14 utt1	B	what brought about the fading of the paint?

sd	17 utt4	A	and we had to scrub the crayon marks off, of course, try and get it clean.
	bk	18 utt1	B	okay,

br	21 utt1	A	Pardon me?
	qy^r	22 utt1	B	Latex?

sd	23 utt4	A	and that's, what we put back on there, was a latex paint.
	b	24 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	25 utt2	A	and one of the younger boys, when he was younger, about three years old, got a nice marker and got up on the ceiling and decided to draw pictures .
	qy	26 utt1	B	On the ceiling?

sd^e	27 utt2	A	on the ceiling.
	b	28 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	29 utt2	A	but you can't it all off.
	aa	30 utt1	B	No,

sd	31 utt1	A	And so, that's one of the reasons why we painted,
	qw	32 utt1	B	what kind of paint did you use on the ceiling?

sd	33 utt1	A	We used a flat, latex paint
	bk	34 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	35 utt1	A	and in the bedroom, as I understand, that's, one of the better type of paints to have because it's not so reflective and glassy colored,
	b	36 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	37 utt2	A	and it, turned out real, real well.
	sd	38 utt1	B	Seems like, we've done some remodeling of some, rental houses that we have

b	39 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	40 utt1	B	and it appears as though that, in the fifties or sixties when some of these houses were built, they used a lot of, semigloss type enamel for ceiling paints

b	41 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	42 utt1	B	and that was a little difficult to cover with today's paints, it seemed like.

bf	47 utt1	A	you had to prime it and and cover over it.
	aa	48 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	51 utt1	A	Huh.
	qy	52 utt1	B	You had pretty good luck with one coat type paint?

sd	53 utt1	A	Well, I like to use this Sears, the ten year guarantee or the fifteen year guarantee.
	qy	54 utt1	B	Weather beater type stuff?

ny	55 utt1	A	Yeah.
	b	56 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	57 utt1	A	And the reason being is once I painted, I don't want to have to go and do it another five or seven years later
	ba	58 utt1	B	Understand.

sd	59 utt2	A	and, we're quite satisfied with that
	b	60 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	61 utt4	A	you mentioned painting your bathroom.
	b	62 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	63 utt1	A	I read an article recently that, you have to be very careful on the kind of paint you put on the ceiling in your bathroom because it does tend to peel or come off because of the high moisture content in your bathroom.
	aa	64 utt1	B	Yeah,

qy	65 utt1	A	And, did you have any problems with that
	sd	66 utt1	B	Well, the particular bathroom that we did is a half bath,

ba	67 utt1	A	good.
	sd	68 utt1	B	I've, have never experienced that type of a problem with a latex paint.

sd	71 utt2	A	neither have I .
	sv	72 utt1	B	So, you shouldn't have a problem with it.

ba	73 utt1	A	good.
	sv	74 utt1	B	they're pretty well refined today a lot of the paints,

b	75 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	76 utt2	B	and Sears is one of the better ones.

b	77 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	78 utt1	B	I've used, many a gallon of them, myself.

qy	79 utt1	A	have you ever used an oil base paint?
	na	80 utt1	B	used oil base paints for trim you know, like around doors and on doors, things like that.

qr	83 utt3	A	but. It adheres better, or lasts longer?
	sd	84 utt1	B	primarily because it seems to be a little more, well, let's say

b	89 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	90 utt1	B	And, you know, it, it gives you a variance even though it's the same color.

ba^r	91 utt3	A	that's good.
	sd	92 utt1	B	So it's worked out pretty well for us.

qy	93 utt1	A	have you ever done any painting outside?
	na	94 utt1	B	quite a bit,

b	2 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	ad	3 utt2	B	make sure it's nice and brown on both sides

b	4 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	ad	5 utt1	B	And then you, pour all of the oil out of the pan

b	6 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	ad	7 utt1	B	Then you, pour that in there, you know, to make the gravy.

b	8 utt1	A	Oh.
	sv	9 utt1	B	And it's going to be really good .

bf	10 utt1	A	That's very spicy, too.
	b	11 utt1	B	Yeah,

bf	12 utt1	A	I mean these bell peppers and curry.
	aa	13 utt1	B	Right,

sv	14 utt1	A	that sounds really good.
	b	15 utt1	B	Yeah.

qy	16 utt3	A	is this dinner time for you?
	na	17 utt1	B	well it will be in a little while,

sd	18 utt5	A	so I did cook a little, you know.
	b	19 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	20 utt4	A	and so we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok.
	b	21 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	22 utt1	A	And we do a lot of, stir fry vegetables.
	qw	23 utt1	B	What kind of wok do you have,

sd	24 utt3	A	so it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does.
	b	25 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	26 utt5	A	and then after the stir fry is over, just mix in, a little bit of, sometimes chicken broth, and corn starch and soy sauce
	b	27 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	28 utt2	A	and that sort of makes a glaze, that sticks to the vegetables,
	b	29 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	30 utt5	A	we don't put in meat, cause I guess I'm not
	b	31 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	32 utt3	A	so. We'll do, a lot of times vegetarian.
	b	33 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	34 utt1	A	But it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and, carrots and celery and green peppers and, gee, mushrooms.
	sv	35 utt1	B	that's, That sounds real good except the squash,

sd	36 utt2	A	and we put that over rice.
	sd	37 utt2	B	I just don't like squash.

bf	38 utt1	A	you don't .
	sd	39 utt1	B	I never did.

b	40 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	41 utt1	B	And maybe she'd have chicken or something.

b	42 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	43 utt1	B	And I'd just be,

sd	44 utt5	A	and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town.
	b	45 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	46 utt2	A	recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato.
	b	47 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd^r	48 utt1	A	Red meat and a potato.
	ba	49 utt1	B	that sounds good.

bf	50 utt1	A	she had all of those types of vegetables.
	aa	51 utt1	B	Right.

sd	52 utt1	A	See, no vegetables in my family.
	ba	53 utt1	B	Wow.

sd	54 utt2	A	it was really funny.
	sd	55 utt1	B	You wouldn't believe it, we even raised chickens .

bf	56 utt1	A	Well that was a real farm.
	qy	57 utt1	B	You ever seen anybody kill a chicken?

sd^r	58 utt3	A	I've heard stories.
	sd	59 utt1	B	And they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off.

ad	62 utt2	A	you shouldn't be talking about this while you're fixing dinner.
	sd	63 utt1	B	Getting ready to eat chicken too.

sd	66 utt3	A	we bought everything in a grocery store.
	b	67 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	68 utt4	A	but when we got married, you know, a lot more vegetables, you know, a lot of changes.
	ba	69 utt1	B	Well that's good.

aa	70 utt1	A	I think so too,
	b	71 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd^r	72 utt3	A	and we came back with sweets.
	ba	73 utt1	B	Ugh.

sd	74 utt2	A	We didn't bring all the healthy food back too.
	b	75 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	76 utt2	A	well that's supposed to be, the trend of the future, but, the cut back.
	b	77 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	78 utt4	A	and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots.
	ba	79 utt1	B	Ugh.

^q	82 utt4	A	Indian candy is not very good.
	aa	83 utt1	B	right.

sd	84 utt4	A	Everything had a little bit of curry in it.
	bf	85 utt1	B	The spice,

sd	86 utt1	A	It was funny, even the sweets did.
	ba	87 utt1	B	Wow.

sd	88 utt3	A	You know, it had that after taste that, it was a very Indian flavor.
	b	89 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	90 utt4	A	they were very, yogurt and carrots and pistachio nuts and yogurt.
	b	91 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	92 utt1	A	And it wasn't very good.
	sd	93 utt1	B	Well I might have liked some of that

b	94 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	95 utt1	B	I really do.

sd	98 utt2	A	I think we're,
	h	99 utt1	B	I don't know,

sd(^q)^t	100 utt3	A	and they say you've overextended your conversation.
	sd^t	101 utt1	B	well this is my first one.

sd(^q)^t	102 utt4	A	and it'll say you've over extended your conversation, you now have fifteen seconds to complete it.
	ba	103 utt1	B	wow.

sd^t	104 utt1	A	But, I've been cut off twice.
	b	105 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	106 utt4	A	he has one of those alarms on his car,
	ba	107 utt1	B	Goodness.

sd	108 utt2	A	and it's going off.
	b	109 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	110 utt1	A	So, I was going to go out and see what they were doing.
	bk	111 utt1	B	Well, okay.

ft	112 utt2	A	hey thanks so much.
	fc	113 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv^t	114 utt3	A	well you'll get a couple more probably.
	b	115 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd^t	116 utt4	A	and she was home with two kids.
	b	117 utt1	B	Ugh.

sd	118 utt4	A	it was pretty funny.
	b	119 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	120 utt1	A	Okay.
	b	121 utt1	B	Okay.

fc	122 utt2	A	I'll talk to you later.
	fc	123 utt1	B	All right,

bf	1 utt1	A	Okay, you say you're going to buy a new car.
	ar	2 utt1	B	Well no,

b	3 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	4 utt1	B	and I drove a nineteen seventy seven, B M W

b	7 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	8 utt1	B	But I'm not interested in having any car payments,

b	9 utt1	A	Yeah
	sd	10 utt1	B	But I also found a nineteen eighty Volvo, station wagon that was in just super condition.

b	11 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	12 utt2	B	I mean there's not a dent on the outside body,

b	13 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	14 utt1	B	it has about eighty thousand miles on it

b	15 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	16 utt1	B	and I think it would last me probably another fifty or sixty thousand miles.

b	17 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	18 utt1	B	So, I guess I'm kind of in limbo waiting to see what the insurance you know, company is going to do, to see whether or not I can get one of these cars.

sd	21 utt2	A	but, so I guess when we do buy another car it'll be something that we can, kind of grow into a little bit.
	b	22 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	23 utt2	A	it's tough on trips because, anytime we're getting ready to go anywhere you know, it's, like trying to put a puzzle together to make sure you get everything in the car, you know, cause it's,
	sd	26 utt1	B	Well not only that, needing the room, you know, we finally ended up buying a Dodge Caravan here about two and a half years ago, because I too, have very small kids.

b	29 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	30 utt1	B	And you know it's like you go on a trip

sd	31 utt5	A	but . You know, I'd like to do that.
	b	34 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv(^q)	35 utt4	A	but, you know, the rest of the time you wonder, you know, could I use something else.
	b	36 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	39 utt3	A	if we can hold out til then, you know, I may get to where I need a something else, maybe buy a van, because they are, really, really nice for long trips especially.
	sd	40 utt1	B	We have definitely put a lot of use in on ours

b	41 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	42 utt1	B	and my husband's been in business for himself for several years

b	43 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	44 utt2	B	used to be you kept them three years.

b	45 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	46 utt1	B	Well when they did all the tax law changes you had to keep them five.

b	47 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	48 utt1	B	So I was trying to keep my B M W in tact, for three more years. So that then I could take the van,

b	51 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	52 utt1	B	And so basically that's what I'm looking for in a used car. Something that's going to last me at least three years.

sd	55 utt1	A	Well, my wife's car is probably around five years old now,
	b	56 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	57 utt6	A	but, you know, it's getting to the point where we really need to do something with it, you know, if we're going to get anything out of selling it.
	b	58 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	61 utt2	A	We've got other bills that kind of precede, or preclude us buying, something, buying something else.
	ba	62 utt1	B	Know how that goes .

sd	65 utt3	A	It just, will wipe you out every month,
	aa	66 utt1	B	That's right .

sd	67 utt2	A	it's almost getting to be like the house payment, you know.
	aa	68 utt1	B	I know,

b	69 utt1	A	Right.
	sv	70 utt1	B	and you just almost can't find that payment anymore.

b	71 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	72 utt1	B	So, I understand that, it's kind of hard to go do.

sd	75 utt1	A	I didn't know that.
	sd	76 utt1	B	And we have had just wonderful luck with ours.

b	77 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	78 utt1	B	which drove me nuts trying to get car seats and kids, into a back seat, you know.

b	79 utt2	A	yeah.
	sd	80 utt2	B	And so it's wonderful to have the room and the space

b	81 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	82 utt1	B	And it is nice on long trips.

b	83 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	84 utt1	B	and they come out fairly easily, so we took out the middle seat, put the car seats in the back and just had a whole area in the middle, like if we were out on open road

b	85 utt1	A	Uh huh,
	sd	86 utt1	B	You know, I wouldn't do that if we were in a city, or, if there were a lot of cars around or anything.

b	87 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	88 utt1	B	But it made it so much easier to travel.

sd	89 utt5	A	and even on the road she does all right for a little while because she'll sleep some,
	b	90 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	91 utt6	A	and it was when all that bad weather was hitting,
	ba	92 utt1	B	yeah.

sd	93 utt6	A	and, and we got out and played in the snow and put here back in / * typo > her
	aa	94 utt1	B	Sure,

sd	95 utt2	A	and she was fine,
	b	96 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	97 utt1	A	but, you know, if there was something to where she could kind of get up and move around, like you say on the highway, or where, where it wasn't, wasn't as bad, you know, just for a little brief period of time, it would be okay,
	b	98 utt1	B	Right.

sd	99 utt2	A	so, I'm thinking maybe we can do something like that later on.
	ba	100 utt1	B	Well that would be good.

sd	101 utt1	A	we'll see what we can do.
	ba^r	102 utt1	B	That would be good.

b	103 utt1	A	Yeah.
	fc	104 utt1	B	Well, I appreciate talking to you.

fc	105 utt3	A	I ho , hope everything works out.
	sd	108 utt1	B	Well, really I'm supposed to hear today

b	109 utt1	A	Right .
	sd	110 utt1	B	and you know, my B M W that my husband was going forty to forty five miles an hour

o	1 utt1	A	All right.
	sd	2 utt1	B	Well, we lived,

b	3 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	4 utt1	B	and we did a lot of gardening out there, and, mostly in raised beds so we could keep the, soil nice, because basically out there it was mostly a clay soil, very hard to grow, very hard to cultivate,

ba	5 utt1	A	How fine.
	sd	6 utt2	B	and we've been planting flowers that we could never plant, in San Antonio because the heat would just dry them up after, you know, about three good weeks of nice weather before the heat started

ba	11 utt1	A	boy.
	sd	12 utt2	B	and, we're at the edge of a forest area, so there's a lot of pine mulch .

b	13 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	14 utt1	B	Just about anything you would want in Texas as a gardener is here just around us.

bh	17 utt1	A	really.
	ny	18 utt1	B	Yeah,

ba	19 utt1	A	Wow.
	sd	20 utt1	B	But, that has been the major change that we have noticed in gardening,

sd	23 utt4	A	So we're just learning the ropes here
	b	24 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	25 utt2	A	our backyard has so many tall trees in it that there wasn't even a blade of grass in the backyard.
	b	26 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	27 utt5	A	It just happened automatically.
	qy	28 utt1	B	So do you have to get a shade tolerant grass?

sd	29 utt3	A	we planted some fescue last, fall
	b	30 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	31 utt6	A	it doesn't look like it can withstand too much, you know.
	b	32 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	33 utt3	A	and, So, but we don't,
	b	34 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	35 utt3	A	like I say, there really wasn't even one blade of grass in the backyard.
	b	36 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd(^q)	37 utt1	A	And, so mostly, you know, we're not even to the point where we're getting into flowers, and flower beds or even gardens, that, we're just saying, let's get some grass .
	bf	40 utt1	B	Just get grass to grow.

^q	41 utt1	A	Let's get grass so that the kids can play in the yard and not have to be worried about the dirt so much. You know.
	sd	42 utt1	B	Well, when we had our house, out in Castroville, the problem with ours is that the, plots there are a third of an acre . And trying to keep grass alive during a summer on a piece of ground that big was expensive .

ba	45 utt1	A	yeah.
	sd	46 utt1	B	To water it

ba	47 utt1	A	no.
	sd	48 utt1	B	we were just watering all the time.

b	53 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	54 utt1	B	And so when we left, you know, the back yard had some,

b	55 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	h	56 utt2	B	But, I don't know.

sd	59 utt3	A	there was no such thing as watering your lawns in Missouri.
	b	60 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	61 utt2	A	It just happened.
	b	62 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	63 utt4	A	we live in north of Dallas.
	b	64 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	67 utt1	A	Plano.
	bk	68 utt1	B	Okay,

sd	69 utt3	A	And so there's a lot of market up here since it's kind of the area that people are moving into in the Dallas area and big market for yard work.
	b	70 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	73 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	74 utt1	B	there's so much money

sd	77 utt3	A	I noticed that they're really putting in small back yards, because most of the houses have the alleys that run behind,
	b	78 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	79 utt5	A	so we're just still at the point where we're talking about the necessity.
	aa	80 utt1	B	Right,

b	81 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	82 utt2	B	and then when it comes to fertilize, then it would come to raking,

b	83 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	84 utt2	B	People that were building the new homes that put those in, that was the only way to go because it was just so convenient.

b	89 utt1	A	Hm.
	sd	90 utt1	B	But there is a grass that you can use that is shade tolerant,

b	91 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	92 utt1	B	It's just a real fancy decorated boot.

b^m	93 utt1	A	Grass,
	sd	94 utt2	B	and I think one of them was a blend of two types of grass that they had used.

^2	97 utt1	A	Or what it was.
	sd	98 utt1	B	But I do remember they had used a blend.

sd	99 utt4	A	and there must be ten or twelve big tall trees out there so that like even if its raining, you can go out in our back yard and not get wet .
	sv	100 utt1	B	but that's so neat, because so many homes don't have that.

sd	101 utt2	A	and that's what they say the payoff is
	sv	102 utt1	B	It makes the biggest difference, when you have the big old trees.

aa	105 utt2	A	yes.
	sv	106 utt1	B	So, that's great that you have them.

sd	107 utt1	A	Well, there are all different kinds.
	ba	108 utt1	B	that's even better.

o	1 utt1	A	Okay.
	b	2 utt1	B	All right.

sd	3 utt2	A	but I've heard that it's real good.
	sd	4 utt1	B	My husband didn't like it that much.

b	7 utt1	A	Oh .
	sd	8 utt1	B	So, the end scenes are kind of suspenseful, you know, when she realizes he's in the house, you know, after her,

b	9 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd^r	10 utt1	B	You know, why didn't she just tell hi ,

b	11 utt1	A	Oh .
	qw	12 utt1	B	But anyhow, what have you seen?

sd	13 utt1	A	Well, last week, as a matter of fact, my children was on Spring Break
	b	14 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	15 utt2	A	We went to see AWAKENINGS with Robin Williams.
	b	18 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	19 utt1	A	And we went to see KINDERGARTEN COP.
	b	20 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	21 utt5	A	and it would be to anyone because, you know, they really don't know that much about it.
	b	22 utt1	B	Uh huh.

aa^r	25 utt2	A	yeah.
	bf	26 utt1	B	And the drugs let them come back.

sd	27 utt3	A	and they started having real bad side effects.
	b	28 utt1	B	Oh .

sd	31 utt4	A	but in time, you know, all the side effects started showing.
	qw	32 utt1	B	Well, how bad were the side effects?

sd	33 utt1	A	Bad.
	b	34 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	35 utt3	A	They actually went back like they were, you know,
	b	36 utt1	B	Oh .

o	43 utt1	A	You know.
	qo	44 utt1	B	Well how about KINDERGARTEN COP?

sd	47 utt2	A	it was,
	sv	48 utt1	B	You know, Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting to be, a bit of a variety actor, you know.

b	49 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	50 utt1	B	But he's kind of branching out.

qy	51 utt3	A	as a matter of fact, Sylvester Stallone, is that his name?
	ny	52 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	57 utt1	A	It was really good.
	sd	58 utt1	B	Well, there was a movie out,

sd	59 utt1	A	I've seen that.
	sd	60 utt1	B	I thought that was just great.

aa^r	61 utt4	A	yes.
	sd	62 utt1	B	I even like I mean, some of the original stuff,

b	63 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	64 utt1	B	but I still like watching him in THE TERMINATOR. and some of the other things.

b	65 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	66 utt2	B	TOTAL RECALL last year I thought was really good, last summer.

b	67 utt1	A	yeah.
	sd	68 utt1	B	Guess it didn't last too long at the box office,

b	69 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	70 utt1	B	but I thought it was pretty good.

sd	77 utt2	A	that's just something I just don't want to watch.
	b	78 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	79 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd(^q)	80 utt1	B	and I just keep telling her, how can you do that?

ba	83 utt1	A	my goodness.
	sd	84 utt1	B	And she watches these really gross things you know, like, THE NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and, you know, that kind of, junk.

b	91 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	92 utt1	B	I don't go for that at all.

sd	93 utt1	A	I guess I'm a little too scary for that.
	sd	94 utt1	B	I remember when I was real little, we all went to some kind of scary movie,

b	95 utt1	A	uh huh.
	o	96 utt1	B	You know,

b	99 utt1	A	Yes.
	sd	100 utt1	B	You know, they tell you that kids can, you know, be impressed by all that stuff,

aa	101 utt3	A	yes.
	sd	102 utt1	B	I had a lot of things that I,

ba	105 utt6	A	goodness.
	sv	106 utt1	B	But I think a lot of kids, it's funny, get the same kind of fears, like there's somebody under the bed.

aa	107 utt1	A	Yes.
	qw	108 utt1	B	Where do we get that from?

^q	111 utt3	A	Mama, I hear it,
	qw@	112 utt1	B	 How old are they?

^q	117 utt5	A	Mama, I've seen it .
	sd	118 utt2	B	but I remember, I was with a friend of mine, had, three kids,

b	119 utt1	A	uh huh.
	sd(^q)	120 utt1	B	And he just bawled at the end and just she's not going to die.

b	123 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd(^q)	124 utt1	B	And we were trying to say, Kenny, it's okay,

b	125 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	126 utt1	B	He just was beside himself, you know,

^g	129 utt2	A	isn't it?
	ny	130 utt1	B	yeah

fc	135 utt2	A	Well, well I've enjoyed talking to you.
	fc	136 utt1	B	You too.

sd^t	141 utt1	A	You know, from where I'm at. We couldn't call in.
	b	142 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd^t	143 utt3	A	So I missed several days, because I was getting quite a few calls.
	ba	144 utt1	B	How weird.

b	147 utt2	A	oh.
	sd^t	148 utt1	B	It was discuss air pollution, causes of it and cures.

b	149 utt1	A	Yes.
	sd(^q)	150 utt2	B	I was going, well .

sd^t	151 utt3	A	and he's at work,
	b	152 utt1	B	Uh huh.

o	157 utt2	A	believe me.
	ad(^q)	158 utt1	B	Say, well, I know it takes a fishing pole and some bait, and some water .

fc	159 utt4	A	and we'll talk to you later.
	fc	160 utt1	B	All right.

na	2 utt2	A	definitely .
	sd	3 utt1	B	Although at least Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet.

sd	4 utt3	A	and New York had a state lottery,
	b	5 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	8 utt3	A	And it was really a great relief when I got to Texas that I didn't have to pay that city income tax, though.
	b	9 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	10 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	11 utt1	B	You know, because other states quite a bi , a chunk out for, city and state taxes

aa^m	12 utt1	A	It sure does make a difference.
	sd	13 utt1	B	A little more take home here .

qy	14 utt2	A	Do you live in Dallas?
	ny	15 utt1	B	Yeah,

bh	16 utt1	A	you do?
	ny	17 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	18 utt1	A	I do too.
	bk	19 utt1	B	okay .

sd	20 utt2	A	and then, you know too, that, taxes are less, like if you live in Mesquite.
	b	21 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	22 utt1	A	You know, some people will go shopping in Mesquite at the malls out there,
	sd	23 utt1	B	Or up to Collin County, somewhere that you're getting out of the, Dallas County area because, what do we pay, like eight and a half percent, something like that for the, sales tax.

b	28 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	29 utt1	B	Which, yeah, that really is pretty high.

qy	30 utt2	A	is it, less in Collin County than it is in Dallas County?
	na,sd,o@	31 utt1	B	I think so, although I really, don't go up there too much, I mean I normally just kind of go to Richardson Square Mall, or Valley View Mall just kind of for the convenience, / * Looks like 2 slash units

sd	36 utt4	A	and you can't do that anymore.
	b	37 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	38 utt2	A	And I had a little, little, coupon special that was twenty two dollars for, air conditioning service where they, checked it and recharged it and put one pound of freon in
	b	39 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd,o@	42 utt1	A	And I couldn't believe it and the tax, you know, really hits you. * both kinds of slash error; Should be 2 slash units, I think Uh huh.
	aa	43 utt1	B	Yeah,

o@	44 utt2	A	And then, * slash error I've been here for nine years. / * slash error
	sv	45 utt1	B	Although I wish, you know, overall they'd try the lottery again.

qw	48 utt1	A	Really, where did you come from?
	sd	49 utt1	B	well, Ohio, kind of.

bk	50 utt1	A	uh huh.
	sd	51 utt1	B	but, you know, basically I went to high school and college in Ohio and lived there more years than I ever did in Michigan.

sd	52 utt3	A	My sister used to live there.
	bk	53 utt1	B	okay .

b	54 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	55 utt1	B	But you know, when we first came down here, I really thought this place was somewhat backward, I mean, I was just shocked that we couldn't shop on Sunday.

o@	58 utt1	A	That's true, I tell you what hit me the first year I was here, Christmas eve in New York there used to be stores open, the department stores wouldn't close, * There seem to be several slash units in this turn that were not parsed that way well I'd say they closed maybe eight or nine o'clock, department stores, on Christmas eve.
	b	61 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	62 utt4	A	but it was Christmas eve.
	b	63 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	64 utt2	A	and I couldn't find hardly anything open, after five o'clock in the afternoon.
	qy(^q)	67 utt1	B	Were you shocked like, no, I'm stuck I need to buy stuff.

sd	70 utt1	A	And then another shock I had well, when I went to, to buy a slice of pizza , and found out that I had to buy the whole pie.
	b	71 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	74 utt4	A	back then they didn't.
	b	75 utt1	B	Right.

sd	76 utt1	A	When I first came, no.
	sv	77 utt1	B	Well the, there was other things too, I mean, I think it's taken us Yankee's influence down here, to get them to, come to the, you know, the correct decade here and century.

b	82 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	83 utt1	B	I mean, you could always, be careful about that back then because, you know, if a cop stopped you then you would, you know, get arrested or what not.

ad	86 utt2	A	and talking about alcohol and beer, look at the taxes on that, and the taxes on a package of cigarettes.
	sd	87 utt1	B	And people would just drink openly.

sd	90 utt2	A	I used to smoke, you know
	b	91 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	92 utt3	A	but I gave them up a couple years ago because I had some sinus problems.
	b	93 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	98 utt1	A	a little bit more in some places.
	bf	99 utt1	B	So you end up about paying about twelve dollars for a pack and two dollars of that is taxes.

o@	100 utt1	A	well, I believe it's a little more than twelve dollars for a carton, * slash error I think it's maybe thirteen or something.
	b	101 utt1	B	Huh.

sd	104 utt3	A	and they really thought they were getting a big discount.
	qy^d	105 utt1	B	They're cheaper there?

na	106 utt1	A	Well because, it's, you know, the Indians, I don't think they pay tax.
	ba	107 utt1	B	Oh!

sd	108 utt1	A	in Oklahoma.
	bk	109 utt1	B	I got you,

sd	110 utt1	A	And, it was a Indian, well it's a bingo hall for the benefit of the Indians there.
	b	111 utt1	B	Uh huh

sd	112 utt2	A	There were just bus loads of people that come from everywhere else to play that bingo because it's, the stakes are higher and payoffs are bigger and so forth.
	qw	113 utt1	B	Well how did you do?

sd	114 utt1	A	I won a dollar .
	b^m	115 utt1	B	A dollar, well,

ad^c	2 utt1	A	Can you speak up, please.
	sd	3 utt1	B	Seems like wanting to go to the Peace Corps was something that I had really wanted to do when I was young.

b	4 utt1	A	Yes.
	sv	5 utt1	B	But, I don't believe they accept you you know, after you're married

sd	8 utt1	A	But they will accept you later in life also.
	qy^d	9 utt1	B	they will?

sd^e	10 utt2	A	after your children are grown.
	sd	11 utt1	B	I didn't know that.

b	12 utt1	A	Yes.
	qy^d	13 utt1	B	Then there's no age limit?

nn	14 utt1	A	No.
	qy^d*	15 utt1	B	Your kidding. / * typo > you're

sd	16 utt4	A	there was a retired plumber that went to, Uruguay I think and helped them quite a bit with concepts in plumbing, you know, providing for better public hygiene.
	ba	17 utt1	B	Goodness I'm surprised.

qy	18 utt2	A	but, so, do you think that people should be required to give a couple years for the good of the country?
	sd	19 utt1	B	Well, , I don't really think that they should be, it should be mandatory.

qw	20 utt1	A	Why?
	sd	21 utt4	B	that just might not be something that everybody wants to do,

qy	22 utt2	A	but if it were told to us that we would find the time somewhere between our seventeenth and, twenty sixth birthday to give a year or two to the, to the country in the form of maybe building better roads or the parks service or the Peace Corps or you know, the military service or something. Wouldn't we have, maybe a better class of Americans?
	sd	23 utt1	B	I don't see how that can make a better class of Americans to make it mandatory for everybody to participate.

sv	24 utt4	A	and that's themselves.
	aa	25 utt1	B	That's true.

sv	26 utt1	A	And at least if you legislated, giving for a couple years of their lives or, honestly purely giving but some sort of equitable exchange, then at least the country would have gotten two years from them where, they would have given something to the country instead of taking away all their lives.
	b	29 utt1	B	Yeah,

bf,nn,o@	32 utt1	A	give them your entire life for two years, no. / * I think this really should be 2 slash units, with the respective labels.
	bk	33 utt1	B	Okay.

sv	34 utt3	A	it's not top wages,
	b	35 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	36 utt1	A	but it does pay.
	b	37 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	38 utt3	A	it doesn't pay well.
	b	39 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy^d	40 utt2	A	You're aware of that I'm sure.
	aa	41 utt1	B	that, that's true.

^2	42 utt1	A	And Texas Instruments.
	sd	43 utt2	B	Thousands, and thousands of people are out there looking for jobs.

sd	44 utt1	A	You know , in another time we had the W P A, Works Progress Administration, during the great depression, though I can't see why it was great.
	ar	45 utt1	B	, no,

sd	52 utt1	A	that gave people pay that was halfway between relief which was welfare, and the minimum wage.
	b	53 utt1	B	Uh huh.

^2	56 utt1	A	In trade for, money, and living.
	bk	59 utt2	B	okay.

sd	64 utt2	A	Public roads that were worked on by the W P A, dams that were built by the W P A, scenic overlooks, parks,
	b	65 utt1	B	uh huh.

sv^r	68 utt2	A	our national road system of highways, and roads, is falling apart.
	b	69 utt1	B	Uh huh.

bf	72 utt1	A	there's a lot of work to be done.
	b	73 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	76 utt1	A	what I'm saying is that if it were mandatory, that every person, right after graduation from high school, that were able bodied, would well, or, not give a year but trade a year,
	b	77 utt1	B	uh huh.

sv	82 utt3	A	at least one not more than say three or four, then it would definitely effect unemployment.
	aa	83 utt1	B	All right,

sd	86 utt1	A	Well, you know, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, huge numbers of other western states, have no real welfare system.
	b	87 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	88 utt2	A	but there's no real welfare system.
	b	89 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	90 utt3	A	You know, we have had some problem with that in recent years.
	aa	91 utt1	B	well, yes,

bf	92 utt1	A	they wish only for the paycheck.
	sd	93 utt1	B	Well, they wish for the money

bf	96 utt2	A	be it selling drugs or whatever.
	aa	97 utt1	B	Right.

sd	98 utt4	A	I enjoy working.
	b	99 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	3 utt1	A	number one, I am one hundred percent for total gun control.
	b^m	4 utt1	B	Total gun control.

sv	7 utt3	A	and I really feel that we have to do something in order to ,
	aa	8 utt1	B	Yes,

b	9 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	10 utt1	B	But I think personally, that we do need some weapons available to most of the people.

sd^e	11 utt2	A	there's only one problem I have with the whole thing though, is, you know, when they do it, I think our biggest problem is, yes, the crooks and what have you are going to get weapons if the weapons are available.
	b	12 utt1	B	Right.

sd	13 utt2	A	I mean there is no,
	b	14 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	17 utt2	A	there is, There is no reason for it. I mean,
	sv	18 utt1	B	I don't think we should have access to those.

sd(^q)@	21 utt1	A	And, you know, when people say, you know, well, my God, they're cutting into my civil liberties and all this, no, I, I take a different stand that as long as they are available and they are so readily accessed out there, then something is taken away from my civil liberties. / * separated into an additional slash unit before no,?
	b	22 utt1	B	Huh .

sv	23 utt5	A	and we've got to reduce the number of weapons that are out in the in the public.
	b	24 utt1	B	Yes.

b	27 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	28 utt1	B	and he was showing me that at a hundred yards, he kept five shots within a quarter of an inch of each other at one hundred yards.

b	31 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	32 utt1	B	just from a technical point of view, that interests me. Not to kill anybody with it or anything with it, but just the fact that a piece of mechanism like that could be made to be so accurate.

sd	33 utt5	A	you know, and, again, my entire family they are all hunters
	b	34 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	35 utt2	A	and I I have no, I really have no problem with sports hunters.
	b	36 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	37 utt5	A	they seem to be losing their common sense over the issue.
	b	38 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	41 utt2	A	I think something will happen.
	b	42 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy	1 utt1	A	do you get together with family reunions
	ny	2 utt1	B	Yes,

sv	3 utt1	A	that will be fun if you have not done it in a while.
	sd	4 utt1	B	My aunt is planning it.

qw	7 utt2	A	where is your family from?
	sd	8 utt1	B	Missouri.

bh	9 utt2	A	Is it?

	sd	34 utt1	B	But, I still have elderly parents alive.

sv	35 utt1	A	Well it, It sure does.
	sd	36 utt2	B	So, it takes a lot of effort to either get everybody called or written and settle on a date, you know that,

sd	41 utt3	A	We just did it you know, by word of mouth.
	b	42 utt1	B	Right.

sd	43 utt1	A	You know. And, my uncle in Louisiana, he is the only one that, you know, had to travel.
	b	44 utt1	B	Uh huh.

	bh	68 utt1	B	Is that right?

sd	69 utt3	A	the last time we had one it was so fun.
	ba	70 utt1	B	That is wonderful.

b	71 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	72 utt1	B	well, we need to have another one.

sd	73 utt2	A	Well, I, we have always had ours in a park or something.
	b	76 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	77 utt3	A	Only thing is, it is big,
	b	78 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	79 utt1	A	and it is open.
	sd	80 utt1	B	we have it usually at this one park because there is a pavilion there, in case it rains.

b	81 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	82 utt2	B	And, you have to have it, fairly early in the summer or it is too hot up there.

qy	83 utt2	A	In Missouri?
	na	84 utt1	B	In Missouri,

sd	85 utt1	A	Well, that was part of the problem with the ones we have.
	b	86 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	87 utt6	A	We was like eight and ten years old.
	b	88 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	89 utt3	A	It was part of the sewage cleaning system.
	bh	92 utt1	B	Isn't that great?

sd	97 utt2	A	I have got a four year old.
	b	98 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	101 utt2	A	But if we could have gotten it by a lake or something, I thought that would have been much better.
	aa	102 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	103 utt1	A	Yeah.
	o@	106 utt2	B	But, Uh huh.

sd	107 utt1	A	I am sorry, there was, I remember now, there was like, a baby pool, just about a foot deep.
	b	110 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	111 utt3	A	We were all kids anyway .
	sv	112 utt1	B	Every family has all that going on,

sd	115 utt1	A	but I love it, all the different foods, because that,
	aa	116 utt1	B	I do too.

qw	121 utt1	A	So, how long did you say it has been since you all had one?
	no	122 utt1	B	I do not know.

sd	125 utt2	A	so I guess it has been seven years since we have had one.
	b	126 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	127 utt1	A	And since then we have lost, well, just our grandmother.
	b	128 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	129 utt1	A	That is surprising.
	sv	130 utt1	B	Well, time flies so fast,

b	131 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	132 utt1	B	So, anyway I hope both our families get to have one soon.

sd	133 utt2	A	It has been like four years since I have been home.
	b	134 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	135 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	136 utt1	B	I know when we had, had our,

sd	139 utt3	A	but I won't do it with the babies.
	b	140 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	141 utt1	A	Because, I have got, a four month old and a four year old.
	ba	142 utt1	B	Lord.

sd	143 utt2	A	And I just quit too .
	^h	144 utt1	B	I am telling you.

sd	145 utt1	A	I won't be adding any more to the family reunion .
	aa	146 utt1	B	No,

sd	147 utt2	A	They are good kids though.
	b	148 utt1	B	Yeah.

fc	149 utt2	A	Anyways, I have enjoyed talking to you.
	fc	150 utt1	B	Enjoyed talking to you.

fc	151 utt1	A	All right.
	fc	152 utt1	B	Good luck in everything.

fc	153 utt1	A	All right, you too.
	fc	154 utt1	B	Bye bye.

o	1 utt1	A	Okay.
	fp	2 utt1	B	Hi.

fp	3 utt1	A	Hi.
	b	4 utt1	B	Okay.

o	5 utt5	A	Period.
	aa	6 utt1	B	That is very true.

b	9 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	10 utt1	B	but, bet right this moment, you probably have several loans out

o	13 utt2	A	thank you .
	sv	14 utt1	B	But, see our whole system is built on owing not borrowing.

sv	17 utt2	A	Our system shouldn't be based on owing and borrowing and all that.
	aa	18 utt1	B	true.

sv	19 utt15	A	And if you want a nicer car than that, well, you save a little longer.
	aa	20 utt1	B	Well, now I agree, I agree with you one hundred percent.

b	21 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	22 utt2	B	I'm just taking the other side so we'll have a discussion here.

sd	25 utt3	A	both of us had twenty thousand dollars in loans, for student loans
	b	26 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	27 utt20	A	And they pay cash for everything they buy.
	b	28 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	29 utt6	A	and we don't want to cut back our services from the government, because we're spoiled.
	sd	30 utt1	B	Well, I have one way to suggest reducing the budget.

qw	31 utt1	A	What?
	sd	32 utt1	B	Very simple.

b	37 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	38 utt1	B	Now give them, what a week, I think we here at T I get a total of eleven a year.

b	41 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	42 utt1	B	And that's about, three or four less than civil servants get.

b	43 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	44 utt1	B	Now just look at that money the government could save if they didn't have all of those days off, all those holidays.

sd	45 utt5	A	You don't even know it's a holiday .
	sv	46 utt1	B	Well, now don't forget the mail is something else again.

qy	47 utt1	A	But isn't it in the federal budget?
	nn	48 utt1	B	No,

qy^d	49 utt2	A	it's not part of our taxes?
	nn	50 utt1	B	No.

qy	51 utt1	A	It's not?
	sd	52 utt1	B	That's why the price of mailing a letter keeps going up.

b^m	53 utt1	A	That's why it keeps going up,
	sd	54 utt1	B	You know, I could I can remember the days when it cost only three cents to mail, a letter.

sv	57 utt1	A	Those stamps are valuable, now.
	b	58 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	61 utt21	A	And I don't think Americans are willing to do it.
	qo	62 utt1	B	Well, what about, sending all this money overseas supporting other governments, third world governments.

sv	63 utt5	A	I mean, it doesn't work, I mean.
	sv	64 utt1	B	Well, in so many cases, it's not a loan,

qy	65 utt25	A	Do you understand?
	nn	66 utt1	B	No.

b	67 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	68 utt1	B	And, World War Two debts have never been repaid.

b	69 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd(^q)	70 utt1	B	And said, well, we'll cancel it just like they did to that Polish debt here, last week.

b	71 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	72 utt1	B	half the countries of the world simply canceled the Poland debts to help them.

sd	73 utt6	A	My opinion's the latter.
	b	74 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qw	77 utt5	A	or I mean, what do you think long term?
	sd	78 utt1	B	Well, I don't believe in a single government or a single control for the world.

b	79 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	80 utt1	B	that's asking for trouble.

b	81 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	82 utt1	B	I mean you could travel from one coast to the other here in the U S and find a tremendous differences between the peoples.

b	83 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	84 utt1	B	So, therefore, I don't believe there could be a single government for the whole world.

b	85 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	o	86 utt1	B	sure,

b	87 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	88 utt1	B	That's a big laugh,

b	89 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	90 utt1	B	We've got too many, immigrants.

sd	91 utt3	A	I know.
	sd	92 utt1	B	They don't call them immigrants anymore,

bf	93 utt2	A	Different ethnic groups .
	aa	94 utt1	B	Yes.

sd*	95 utt2	A	I know what your saying. / * typo your > you're
	sd	96 utt1	B	My grandfather came over from Lithuania back, just before the turn of the century

b	97 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	98 utt1	B	and, as a matter of fact he's a draft dodger.

b	99 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	100 utt1	B	He, was supposed to serve some time.

b	101 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	102 utt1	B	And he came back.

qw	1 utt1	A	which ones have you seen lately?
	sd	2 utt1	B	I just sort of blanking tonight.

sd	3 utt1	A	THELMA AND LOUISE,
	b^m	4 utt1	B	THELMA AND LOUISE,

qy	5 utt3	A	Is it good?
	ny	6 utt1	B	Yeah,

bh	7 utt1	A	Is it?
	ny	8 utt1	B	yeah,

qw	9 utt3	A	which Billy Crystal movie?
	sd	10 utt1	B	this is the,

^2	11 utt1	A	CITY SLICKERS,
	aa	12 utt2	B	right.

sv	13 utt1	A	That's a real good show.
	qy	14 utt1	B	Have you seen that?

sv	15 utt5	A	but it says a lot about middle life you know,
	b	16 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	17 utt2	A	and, it's a really good show.
	b	18 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	19 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	20 utt1	B	And I'd heard it was really good, too

qy	21 utt5	A	Have you seen that?
	nn	22 utt1	B	No.

sv	23 utt1	A	It's a really good show.
	b	24 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	25 utt1	A	has Jeff Bridges and, Robin Williams.
	b	26 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	27 utt1	A	really, really good.
	b	28 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	29 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	30 utt1	B	I mean it kind of runs in, in batches,

b	33 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	qw	34 utt1	B	what kind of movies in general do you like to watch?

sd	35 utt2	A	but, I really enjoy watching a movie where they don't really try and attract you know, the great audience, but rather put out a real good movie.
	b	36 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy	37 utt3	A	Did you ever see that?
	nn	38 utt1	B	No,

sd	39 utt2	A	I think it's put out by Landmark Productions, the same people who put out CHARIOTS OF FIRE.
	b	40 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	41 utt4	A	and, it's about, Jesuit community at the Inca Falls in, South America, Northern Argentina.
	b	42 utt1	B	uh huh

sd	43 utt1	A	really, really good show.
	sd	44 utt2	B	in fact, I, I'll, I'll look for it because I ,

sv	45 utt4	A	The cinematography is just beautiful and really beautiful scenes and real good music.
	b	46 utt1	B	Actually yeah,

b	47 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	48 utt1	B	And, I'm sure that, that would make it worth her watching.

b	49 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	50 utt3	B	my, my movie watching has, severely, has changed a lot since I got married.

bh	51 utt1	A	yeah?
	ny	52 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	57 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	58 utt1	B	and so I, I, I, I really, I used to watch a fair number of foreign films.

b	59 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	60 utt1	B	And I find I don't do it anymore or else I have to watch them on my own.

sd	61 utt3	A	and, it gets very difficult to,
	^2	62 utt1	B	Find something both of you will watch.

aa^r	63 utt2	A	yeah.
	sv	64 utt2	B	it's funny because most women aren't really,

bh	65 utt1	A	really?
	ny	66 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	69 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	70 utt1	B	Keep her on the edge of her seat.

sv	73 utt3	A	Sometimes you're in the mood for it even.
	sd	74 utt1	B	But, so it, it varies,

sv	81 utt2	A	But it's fun to,
	aa	82 utt1	B	Well, yeah,

bf	85 utt3	A	that's, The ones where they dub in the English.
	sv	86 utt2	B	they won't come within ten feet of, all the ya . All the sounds of the karate chops flying through the air .

qy	93 utt3	A	are you, fluent in another language
	ny	94 utt2	B	yeah,

bh	95 utt1	A	you don't?
	nn	96 utt1	B	No,

sd	97 utt3	A	but I do enjoy watching you know, subtitles.
	b	98 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd^t	1 utt1	A	we are to discuss air pollution and, what we think the causes are.
	b	2 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	3 utt1	A	And I probably would, target, industry as being number one polluter.
	aa	6 utt1	B	Yeah,

aa	9 utt1	A	yes.
	b	10 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	11 utt2	A	because, there's a lot of commercial vehicles out there, especially the big rigs like the busses and, the big, eighteen wheelers and so forth.
	b	16 utt1	B	Huh .

sv	25 utt2	A	and they haven't released it yet.
	b	26 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	27 utt1	A	I think there's a lot of hold back, because, of, priorities that they have, you know,
	b	30 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	35 utt1	A	You have some children.
	sd	38 utt1	B	I have five in the kitchen at the moment.

qrr	41 utt2	A	or do you,
	sd	42 utt1	B	I have three of my own

qy	47 utt1	A	is there anything,
	sd	48 utt1	B	They cause more noise pollution than air pollution .

sv	49 utt1	A	Well, temporarily they do.
	aa	50 utt1	B	That's right,

sv	51 utt1	A	Then we get out of that phase, soon enough.
	b	52 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	55 utt1	A	yes.
	sd	56 utt1	B	I remember being,

b	57 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	58 utt1	B	and, I can remember the smell of Newark vividly .

b	59 utt2	A	sure.
	sv	60 utt1	B	And it's the type of industry, you know, which obviously if you can smell it, it's in the air.

sd	61 utt3	A	and the fumes from the incineration was a terrible pollutant to the air.
	b	62 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	67 utt2	A	and it's not gone either, because it has untold ramifications.
	b	68 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	69 utt1	A	And, And it gets into people, you know, which is, the most important, resource that we have is people,
	sd	70 utt1	B	Then it just gets into the soil and into the water .

sv	73 utt3	A	they, really are.
	b	74 utt1	B	Yeah.

h	79 utt1	A	So they say .
	sv	80 utt1	B	I think we've got to do more with the recycling.

sv	81 utt2	A	but there's not enough.
	b	82 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	83 utt1	A	And we need expert cooperation.
	sv	84 utt3	B	at least they're starting, you know.

sv	85 utt2	A	Education of the, Education of the people is primary, I would think.
	sv	86 utt1	B	So at least they're moving that direction.

sv	89 utt1	A	and we're hard to teach.
	b	90 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv^r	91 utt1	A	We are hard to teach.
	sv	92 utt1	B	it's probably going to be a generation or two before, before it's really going, very well, because now the adults are more aware of it,

b	95 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	96 utt2	B	and the children are being taught in the schools it'll be, you know, on down the road this is going to be passed on, which is good.

sv	97 utt3	A	of course, we would like to see it accelerated because, of the critical nature of it.
	b	98 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	99 utt2	A	just to, think that way, we have to be in that thought pattern and able to, motivate ourselves to, do what is right for the atmosphere.
	b	100 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	101 utt2	A	I mean, every human being that lives is a contributor, to pollution,
	b	102 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	107 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	108 utt2	B	and as we educate them individually what they can do, people become more aware of the things in industry too that are causing problems

sv	109 utt1	A	Well, hopefully it can be resolved within a shorter time frame than we have seen it done in the past. That the time frame for cleaning up our air and our, land, you know, which, we get our nutrients from.
	b	110 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	113 utt1	A	You know, I mean, everything goes back to the land.
	t3	116 utt2	B	I'll turn it up in a minute, honey, when I'm done .

sv	117 utt1	A	So it's just, very critical, I think at this point to, get that through to the people and get us educated.
	b	118 utt1	B	Uh huh

sd	123 utt1	A	I don't know if they offer classes in the grade school, subjecting.
	sd	126 utt1	B	I think they teach it a lot in science .

bk	127 utt2	A	okay.
	b	128 utt1	B	Yeah.

qy	129 utt2	A	Would that be, perhaps, the first grade level, which would be,
	sd	130 utt1	B	I, I think they're kind of getting it in all different grades.

sv	133 utt3	A	and they can really , relate to that.
	b	134 utt1	B	Yeah.

br^m	137 utt1	A	Target stores?
	aa	138 utt1	B	Yeah.

bk	139 utt1	A	okay.
	sd	140 utt1	B	if you go in the entrance, they've got, stands usually where they have, kind of a little newspaper thing that the kids can read

b	141 utt1	A	Okay.
	sd	142 utt2	B	and , and they can form a group to,

^2	145 utt2	A	help fight the pollution.
	aa	146 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	149 utt2	A	and others will pick up on their example and carry it, further.
	b	150 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	151 utt1	A	You know, because, thoughts are,
	sv	152 utt1	B	Well, I know it's a hard problem to solve because you know, like McDonald's has changed back and forth between paper and foam and that kind of thing,

b	153 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	154 utt1	B	and they do all these studies on which ones pollute more,

sd	1 utt1	A	Well, I was just looking around my house and thinking about the painting that I've done.
	b	2 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	3 utt4	A	it was kind of an orangish brown.
	b	4 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	5 utt1	A	It was not real pretty.
	b	6 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	7 utt1	A	Anyway, so the kitchen was one of the rooms that got hit with that color.
	b	8 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	9 utt3	A	and if I look underneath my cabinets, I'm not satisfied with the jobs I did on it because there're splotches.
	b	10 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	11 utt1	A	But, I'm glad it's done, because it's brighter.
	aa	12 utt1	B	Yeah,

ba	15 utt1	A	lord.
	sd	16 utt2	B	I guess the big discussion, just kind of what you were mentioning, has been the color.

b	17 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	18 utt1	B	and we put a flat over the top,

b	19 utt1	A	yeah.
	sd	20 utt1	B	Every time the sun would come up in the morning I'd see another spot and have to drag out the paint can.

qw	21 utt1	A	So what are you going to get it off with if you get it on and it's dried?
	sd	22 utt1	B	Well, it's not too bad.

b	23 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd*	24 utt1	B	and it's really not to bad to get off, / * typo to > too

qy^d	25 utt1	A	And it's not scratching your floor, because it's so thick.
	nn	26 utt1	B	No,

sd	29 utt2	A	We have two children.
	b	30 utt1	B	Okay,

sd	33 utt1	A	it's just terrible what they do.
	b	34 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	35 utt3	A	So I've got dye on my bathroom door.
	ba	36 utt1	B	gosh.

sd	37 utt2	A	I guess I'll have to take that door down and really get it good.
	aa	38 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	39 utt1	A	And then we have a two story.
	b	40 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	41 utt1	A	We did the outside of it one summer.
	b	42 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	43 utt3	A	I could get up on the roof and do that.
	b	44 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	45 utt1	A	But, I dread that the next time.
	b	46 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	49 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	50 utt2	B	you know, you're not nearly as concerned with a barn or a grainery, or something like that as you would be with your own house.

qy	53 utt1	A	Have you guys tackled your ceilings yet?
	na	54 utt1	B	a little bit,

sd	55 utt2	A	We're dreading it.
	b	56 utt1	B	Yeah

sd	57 utt1	A	It's like, they're dark.
	b	58 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	59 utt1	A	Everything else is white.
	ba	60 utt1	B	gosh,

qy	61 utt1	A	Now have you thought about this? That wherever you buy your paint, you need to make sure that that store's not likely to go out of business.
	ny	62 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	63 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	64 utt1	B	But, It's gone pretty well.

sd	65 utt1	A	but I still feel good, the minute I put that paint on, even if it does got a dent in it
	b	66 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	67 utt1	A	I do.
	aa	68 utt1	B	Yeah,

qy	71 utt2	A	Do you do that?
	ny	72 utt1	B	Yeah.

qy^d	73 utt1	A	Spots in it.
	ny	74 utt1	B	Yeah,

qy	75 utt1	A	Are you having to repair the walls at all?
	sd	76 utt3	B	they're in pretty good condition, as far as, major repairs. You know, a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that,

ba	77 utt1	A	that's smart.
	b	78 utt1	B	yeah,

qw	79 utt1	A	So where do you live?
	sd	80 utt1	B	live in Dallas.

sd	81 utt1	A	I'm in Garland.
	bk	82 utt1	B	Okay,

qy^t	85 utt2	A	did you keep getting that it was down?
	nn	86 utt1	B	No,

bh	87 utt1	A	You didn't?
	sd	88 utt1	B	In fact, we were planting flowers this weekend .

sd	89 utt2	A	well, I've never tried any other kinds of painting besides on a surface like the house like to paint a picture or anything.
	b	90 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	91 utt3	A	I can't think of anything else to say about painting.
	b	92 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	93 utt2	A	and it hurts your arm.
	aa	94 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	95 utt1	A	Yeah.
	o	96 utt1	B	but, no,

^g	97 utt2	A	right?
	ny	98 utt1	B	yeah,

qy	99 utt2	A	Do you have one of those straightedge things to put underneath when you're doing the baseboards?
	ny	100 utt1	B	Yeah,

qy	101 utt1	A	On your baseboards?
	ny	102 utt1	B	Yeah,

qy^d	103 utt1	A	You don't have any carpet down in your house?
	nn	104 utt1	B	No

sd	105 utt2	A	and, I haven't figured out how you're supposed to paint it, on down, so that you won't see where you stopped off and still not get it on the carpet.
	b	106 utt1	B	kay.

sd	109 utt1	A	You can't hold it there until it's dried.
	aa	110 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	2 utt1	A	I think we're overtaxed to the hilt.
	b	3 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	4 utt5	A	but eventually they may try to push it through.
	b	5 utt1	B	really.

sd	6 utt1	A	no state income tax.
	sd	7 utt1	B	that's great, because they don't have it in Florida.

b	8 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	9 utt1	B	I mean, you know, like I say, I'm in New York

sv	10 utt2	A	I think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits.
	aa	11 utt1	B	Right,

b	12 utt1	A	Right.
	o@	13 utt1	B	I think if it were to be, if it were to be, hold on a second please, someone just walked in the ro , * seems to me that the "hold on" should be a separate slash unit (marked 'ad'), and shouldn't continue into B.15 if it were to be spent in the right way I think I wouldn't be so upset about it, / * see B.13 note

aa	14 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	15 utt2	B	but given that it's not spent properly, I think it's a major problem.

sv	16 utt1	A	Well we're really overburdened from federal, state and local, that it takes such a size out of your paycheck that there's not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck.
	b	17 utt1	B	Uh huh

b	20 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	21 utt2	B	so they want I think they're trying,

sv	22 utt1	A	Well they're kind of put into a trap of being out there to please the special interest groups as well.
	b	23 utt1	B	Right.

sv	24 utt1	A	And, I think the only way that can be changed for us to get a better tax revenue that's fairness and all, is for us to limit their terms.
	b	25 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	26 utt1	A	And by doing so, they're not obligated to anybody.
	aa	27 utt1	B	I agree,

sv	28 utt2	A	but, what in general though that taxes are doing to us is, it's just taking, a bite out of our savings.
	aa	29 utt1	B	Right,

b	30 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	31 utt1	B	You know, but I'm not convinced, a , tha , that Social Security is doing as well as it should you know, and, and, and, and, and that, you know, those people who need it for welfare and so forth, who really need it for welfare, not the eighty five to ninety percent of them who don't need it. But I mean the real people who really need it, you know, should be getting it

sv	32 utt1	A	And I believe the Social Security tax is a great scheme.
	qy	33 utt1	B	You think so?

sv	34 utt3	A	right now, they're robbing from it to pad the federal deficit.
	aa	35 utt1	B	I know

sv	36 utt3	A	If, most company, C E O s were to do that within their private company, they'd be in jail.
	b	37 utt1	B	Yeah

qh	38 utt1	A	So how are we letting them get away with it.
	b	39 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	40 utt1	A	Right.
	sv	41 utt2	B	it'd be nice if we sort of, as one, band together

b	42 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	43 utt1	B	To see if we could sort of clean them up

sv	44 utt1	A	A lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and feel absolutely helpless to oppose a lot of the situations going on, in the taxing system.
	b	45 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	48 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	49 utt1	B	I sort of get discouraged when I think about all the things that I think are wrong .

b	50 utt2	A	uh huh.
	h	51 utt1	B	So, I don't kno ,

sv	52 utt2	A	It's just going to take, really, a combination effort, I think, of the majority of the American people to come to a decisive answer, or vote to limit the way it's spent.
	b	55 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	56 utt1	A	See, we're, we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place.
	aa	57 utt1	B	Right.

sv	58 utt2	A	and they are controlled, or pretty much do what they want to do.
	aa	59 utt1	B	Right,

sv	60 utt2	A	or, it's occurred so many times that they figure people will usually forget and don't think about it when the election time arises.
	b	61 utt1	B	Right .

sv	64 utt1	A	And generally it does work out that way.
	sv	65 utt1	B	They do forget, it's true, because everybody,

b	66 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	67 utt1	B	So it becomes, a general battle of the sort of the election of the lesser of two evils, I think,

b	68 utt1	A	Yeah.
	h	69 utt1	B	I don't know,

b	70 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	71 utt1	B	and what I make isn't taxed very highly because I'm still in school.

sv	72 utt1	A	Well when you get out into the real world then you'll know.
	sd	73 utt1	B	But my, my, my wife has a real job

b	74 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	75 utt1	B	Especially around bonus time.

qy	76 utt2	A	you have a bonus?
	b^m	77 utt1	B	Bonus,

b	78 utt1	A	Oh.
	nn	79 utt3	B	no

b	80 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	81 utt1	B	We're lucky to get paychecks the way I figure.

^g	82 utt2	A	right.
	sd	83 utt1	B	my wife is taxed on her bonus as well,

b	84 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	85 utt1	B	I mean her bonus isn't that much,

b	86 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	87 utt1	B	So she gets destroyed on her bonus check.

b	88 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	89 utt1	B	So, she works in, in sales.

sv	90 utt2	A	but then you're paying really high taxes when you're doing a lucrative job.
	aa	91 utt1	B	Yes,

b	92 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	h	93 utt2	B	So, I don't know,

sd^t	94 utt2	A	Well, I have, about said all I can think of to say.
	aa	95 utt1	B	Same here,

sv^t	96 utt2	A	it's a rather touchy topic at that,
	aa	97 utt2	B	I, I do agree with you, most wholeheartedly.

ba	98 utt1	A	Well that's great.
	fc	99 utt1	B	It's been a pleasure talking with you.

fc	100 utt1	A	You too,
	ft	101 utt1	B	Thanks for call.

fc	102 utt1	A	have a good day.
	fc	103 utt1	B	You too.

qy	1 utt2	A	do you work outside the home?
	nn	2 utt1	B	No,

ba	3 utt2	A	wow .
	qy	4 utt1	B	Do you?

qy	5 utt1	A	Have you?
	br^m	6 utt1	B	Have I?

ny	7 utt2	A	uh huh.
	nn	8 utt1	B	no,

ny	9 utt2	A	well, yes I do.
	bk	10 utt1	B	Okay.

qy^d	11 utt6	A	I'm assuming that you are married and have a husband that supports you.
	na	12 utt1	B	Right.

ad	13 utt2	A	And so we could talk about, that path, you know, how important you think his benefits are. and, and, how important you think they are and what would you like to see increased in his benefits.
	aa	14 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	17 utt2	A	How important you think that would be.
	aa	18 utt1	B	Right.

bf	19 utt1	A	Because of course, if you did not have them, you would be pulling from your salary, of course.
	aa	20 utt1	B	Exactly,

aa	21 utt1	A	Right,
	aa^r	22 utt1	B	exactly.

aa^r	23 utt1	A	right.
	sv	24 utt1	B	Especially when you have a family, with children, and you are always going to the doctor for,

bf	25 utt1	A	And they always have surprises for you.
	aa	26 utt1	B	Exactly,

b^m	27 utt1	A	With children,
	sv	28 utt1	B	they always do.

sd	29 utt2	A	we could not do without the benefit package from any company that we worked whether they be a conglomerate or just a small, business.
	aa	30 utt1	B	Yeah,

^2	31 utt1	A	You would still have something.
	aa	32 utt1	B	Exactly.

aa	33 utt1	A	Right.
	sv	34 utt2	B	Also, for working women I think a lot of the companies should start providing for day care in the, in the building.

sd	39 utt4	A	and that's one of the areas that she is working on. To have, a day care center for the children of the nurses that are staffing the facility.
	b	40 utt1	B	Right.

sv	41 utt1	A	And that is true in many, many areas of, you know, job titles and professions.
	b	42 utt1	B	Yeah.

bf	49 utt2	A	it would, It would be just futile.
	sd	52 utt1	B	And it would be just,

bf	53 utt1	A	And they would not have the quality,
	sd	54 utt1	B	basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care, center.

bf	55 utt1	A	And they, would be deprived of their mother.
	aa	58 utt1	B	Exactly.

ba	59 utt3	A	I understand that totally .
	sd	60 utt1	B	Besides which, it would be easier, there's a lot of single mothers out there now, from divorces and a lot of, women are starting to have babies without a partner.

aa	63 utt2	A	that's true.
	sv	64 utt1	B	And to go to work, you are worried about your child, besides which you have to get up earlier to take the child to day care.

aa	65 utt1	A	Right.
	sv	66 utt1	B	And if they were in the same building then you are going to the same place,

b	67 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	68 utt2	B	and you could go for your lunch hour down and visit with your child, you know, and take your breaks with your children, or something.

qy	73 utt1	A	Do you think that would be, acceptable?
	sv	74 utt1	B	I think tha ,

aa	77 utt1	A	I do too.
	sv	78 utt1	B	I think if the company could not provide it all on their own, for the people that would be using it, you know, a certain amount of their salary would go to it.

aa	83 utt1	A	That's right.
	sv	84 utt1	B	But it would still probably be cheaper , with the company helping, if everybody, you know, pulled their own weight in it.

aa	89 utt4	A	I, agree with that.
	sv	90 utt1	B	I think it would be really. really great.

sv	93 utt1	A	That would be fair.
	b	94 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	95 utt1	A	Yeah.
	aa	96 utt1	B	I do.

qo	97 utt1	A	and how do you feel about, let's see, eye care?
	sv	98 utt1	B	Eye care is good.

sd	101 utt1	A	Vision, I guess it's called, vision care.
	b	102 utt1	B	Yeah.

arp	105 utt1	A	It depends on who examines your eyes.
	aa	106 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	107 utt1	A	If you have an optometrist or an ophthalmologist, there's a vast difference in those two, professionals.
	aa	108 utt1	B	Right,

^2	113 utt1	A	Glaucoma.
	ar	114 utt1	B	Well, she does not have it,

bk	117 utt1	A	okay,
	sd	118 utt2	B	Her eyes are changing,

b	119 utt1	A	Yes.
	sd	120 utt1	B	and she has to be tested periodically.

aa	123 utt2	A	they are.
	sd	124 utt1	B	Now, I think your insurance covers her on that,

b	125 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	126 utt2	B	but you know, for something like that, that's just as bad as a medical, you know,

bf	127 utt2	A	that's critical, because she's in need of it so often.
	aa	128 utt1	B	Right.

sv^r	129 utt3	A	and, you know, people have needs in their life that unique to us, to them.
	aa	130 utt1	B	Right.

sv	131 utt1	A	I mean, we are all different
	sd	132 utt1	B	Now, I would like to see better dental insurance to me.

sd^e	133 utt2	A	that's my other phone.
	b	134 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	135 utt5	A	and she's on vacation,
	bk	136 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	137 utt1	A	so, it's okay.
	sd	138 utt1	B	But, with the three children orthopedic care, not orthopedic, orthodontic care,

sv	141 utt1	A	That's very expensive.
	sd	142 utt1	B	because on a lot of the dental insurance, they do not cover that well.

sv	143 utt3	A	Orthodontic work is terribly expensive.
	aa	144 utt1	B	Yes,

sv	145 utt1	A	Especially when you have a lot of problems with the children teeth, and you have to really get them when they are young, in order to have, not, a decent smile when they are fifteen, sixteen years old.
	b	146 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	149 utt2	A	and they started having extractions at age eight, because they just had too many teeth for their size mouth.
	b	150 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	151 utt1	A	And we footed the bill, because there was not any such thing when they were young.
	aa	152 utt1	B	Right.

b	153 utt1	A	uh huh.
	sd	154 utt1	B	And it affects his speech a little bit, not anything, you know,

^2	155 utt2	A	major.
	aa	156 utt1	B	Right.

b	157 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	158 utt1	B	But just enough that his bite is off a little bit

sd	159 utt1	A	Well, I tell you I just read an article in the paper about what they are doing, I think it was an ad in our publication at Texas Instruments, where they are breaking the jaw and, and lining the jaw up with the teeth.
	b	160 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	161 utt2	A	it's less painful and less expensive.
	bh	162 utt1	B	Really.

ny	163 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	164 utt1	B	That sounds like it would hurt more.

sd	165 utt2	A	but it's, it's, easier on the patient in the long run, which amazed me.
	ba	166 utt1	B	gosh.

qo	1 utt1	A	So, Beverly, what do you think about drug testing?
	sv	2 utt1	B	I think in some professions it's, essential. Things like pilots and things that involve the safety of other people particularly.

sd	3 utt2	A	we got a lot of mistakes here, in the Maryland, Baltimore area because of, train conductors on drugs.
	b	4 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	5 utt4	A	I guess he smoked marijuana for lunch and, drove his truck up the back of two small cars in a tunnel that goes underneath a river that leads into the Chesapeake Bay
	ba	6 utt1	B	my goodness,

qh	7 utt9	A	but then you know, who would test all truck drivers you know,
	sv	8 utt2	B	that is a problem

sv	13 utt1	A	I think, looking at athletes being drug tested
	b	14 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	15 utt2	A	I think the random drug testing, I don't know in my own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs, because they're still being caught
	b	16 utt1	B	Right.

qy	17 utt1	A	that make sense?
	ny	18 utt1	B	Yes,

sv	23 utt1	A	I, I think, in the long run I think it would be good.
	b	24 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	25 utt1	A	I think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have gotten away with it you know, the test hasn't come down hard on anyone
	b	26 utt1	B	Right.

h	29 utt1	A	I don't know.
	sd	30 utt1	B	however, here in Dallas we had a player, Roy Tarpley on the Mavericks team

b	33 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	34 utt1	B	and he had been suspended a couple of times because of drug testing,

b	35 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	36 utt1	B	and, just recently he was, missing from practice

b	39 utt1	A	Yeah,
	sd	40 utt2	B	so they were able to get rid of him and not have to pay his contract.

b	43 utt2	A	yeah.
	sd	44 utt1	B	And so, in his case, he lost his whole career,

b	45 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	46 utt1	B	and talk about a terrible role model,

sd	47 utt4	A	I guess, my dad was hit by a drunk driver who was also high when I was probably eighteen, my senior year in high school
	ba	50 utt1	B	my goodness.

sd	51 utt5	A	and I could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him
	b	52 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	53 utt2	A	and from from that point on, I became so anti drunk driving now I think people should be allowed to drink, I think that's an adult responsibility, whatever,
	ba	54 utt1	B	that's terrible.

sv	57 utt4	A	and drugs have, long lasting effects
	b	58 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	59 utt1	A	and I guess when I younger I was, probably a little more liberal on the subject.
	sv	60 utt1	B	I think most of us are.

sd	61 utt3	A	I guess when I was eighteen years old, if you'd have asked me, I'd have thought it was fine
	b	62 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	63 utt1	A	but by the time I was nineteen my opinion had totally changed.
	aa	64 utt1	B	Yes,

b	65 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	66 utt1	B	the drunk and his wife in the car were killed,

b	67 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	68 utt1	B	he went through surgery after surgery

sd	69 utt1	A	Traction and all that terrible stuff.
	sd	70 utt1	B	and for a long time they didn't even know whether he'd be normal again.

b	71 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	72 utt1	B	He, has been tutored,

sv	73 utt3	A	I don't think somebody,
	sd	74 utt1	B	He may never have all those motor skills back.

sv	75 utt2	A	you don't, you don't have the right to interfere in somebody else's life.
	aa	76 utt1	B	No.

sv^r	77 utt2	A	You don't have the right to interfere in somebody's life.
	sd	78 utt1	B	Another thing that we saw here recently. some of our high school kids were out goofing around in a park area that a train track ran through

b	79 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	80 utt1	B	and one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try to play with the train.

b	81 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	82 utt1	B	he was in a coma for four months,

b	83 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	84 utt2	B	he's out of the coma now,

b	85 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	86 utt1	B	but he's lost,

sd^t	2 utt2	A	This is a subject that I'm not real well versed on,
	ad	3 utt1	B	Well, let's talk about air pollution.

aa	4 utt1	A	Okay.
	qw	5 utt1	B	What do you think causes air pollution in Dallas?

o	6 utt1	A	No.
	qy^d	7 utt1	B	Maybe you're not in Dallas.

sd	8 utt4	A	I'm in Richardson.
	bk	9 utt1	B	Okay.

qo	10 utt1	A	What do you think as far as air pollution in the Dallas area?
	sd	11 utt1	B	Well, I have some small experience in this area.

b	12 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	13 utt2	B	But, one of the major problems that Dallas has is oxides and nitrogen.

b	16 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	17 utt1	B	power plants since,

bh	20 utt1	A	really?
	sd	21 utt2	B	And that's, course hydrogen sulfide, which is when you burn gasoline, you also produce some water vapor and that goes back in with your sulphur

b	22 utt1	A	Sure.
	sd	23 utt2	B	and under the right condition you get H two S.

sv	24 utt1	A	Well, you are well versed on the subject, I tell you.
	bd	25 utt1	B	Well, I don't know.

sd	26 utt2	A	I guess I notice it the most just, in driving around Dallas with all the highway equipment that's working on the on, six thirty five and seventy five, just the cars in general.
	b	27 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	28 utt2	A	That's where I see most of it.
	sd	29 utt2	B	Ron a lot of this is caused by the fact that cars sitting in traffic tend to run rich because the way the pollution is.

b	30 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	31 utt1	B	And when they run rich they spit out a lot of hydrocarbons,

sv	34 utt1	A	and I think they'll be working on them long after my wife and I are gone.
	sd	35 utt1	B	Well, I guess, not trying to top you, but I grew up in Dallas county and I can remember when they built the north part of North Central which was built after the south part of Central

b	36 utt1	A	Right .
	sd	37 utt2	B	and, I can remember coming over the hill down there long about, I don't know, little bit north of Mockingbird on up over those hills

sd	40 utt6	A	and, I guess when you're out on the interstate, heading north or south and you're just cruising right along and there's no build up of cars
	b	41 utt1	B	Yeah,

ny	44 utt1	A	Yes.
	sd	45 utt2	B	Right along in there somewhere, suddenly the air feels cleaner.

co	46 utt3	A	and I'm going to make it a point to.
	sd	47 utt1	B	Well, sometimes it depends on which way the winds blowing

b	48 utt1	A	Sure.
	sd	49 utt1	B	but, I also travel a little bit

sd,o@	2 utt2	A	We eat out quite a bit, it's just my husband and I at home now. / * 2 slash units?
	qy	3 utt1	B	once a week, twice a week?

sd	4 utt3	A	When we working out we ate out more than that .
	b	5 utt1	B	Yeah,

o@	6 utt1	A	* slash error Uh huh. / * slash error
	sd	7 utt1	B	but we both work

qw	8 utt2	A	Well, what type of restaurant do you like, Richard?
	sd	9 utt1	B	really, I'm kind of open on food.

b	12 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	13 utt1	B	Been on a real barbecue kick lately.

bh	14 utt1	A	have you?
	ny	15 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	16 utt2	A	We eat, a lot of Chinese food.
	b	19 utt1	B	Excuse me. yeah,

qw	20 utt1	A	What do you look for in a restaurant?
	sd	21 utt1	B	I hate franchised restaurants.

br	22 utt1	A	You what?
	sd^r	23 utt1	B	I despise franchised restaurants.

sd	28 utt4	A	I don't like fast food hamburgers and all of that.
	sd	29 utt1	B	I don't,

b	30 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	31 utt1	B	You know, if I could have a good small restaurant or a good large restaurant I'd go to the good small restaurant.

b	32 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	33 utt1	B	And I don't know why that is.

sd	34 utt3	A	I don't care to go to a place just for the price of it .
	aa	35 utt1	B	Well, yeah,

sd	36 utt1	A	I mean, it's like continental French restaurant or something really with high prices
	b	37 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	38 utt2	A	and seven courses isn't what I usually look for .
	br^m	39 utt1	B	It is what you look for?

ng^r,o@	40 utt1	A	It isn't, no that isn't what I look for. / * More than 1 slash unit?
	b^m	41 utt1	B	isn't.

aa	42 utt1	A	Right .
	sd	43 utt1	B	And not just that, well, that's a big part of it. I try to get my money's worth. You know, and not just in quantity, you know, but quality, and flavor and texture and care.

bf	46 utt1	A	Presentation
	arp	47 utt1	B	Well, presentation's not always all of it either.

sd	48 utt1	A	Well, like we've been eating some in a restaurant that just changed hands recently,
	sv	49 utt1	B	it's important.

sd	50 utt4	A	and I had a pretty good meal of grilled pork chops and a baked apple and potatoes.
	b	51 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	52 utt1	A	So I said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce, something like that .
	aa	53 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	54 utt2	A	that's what I mean by,
	sd	55 utt1	B	and just for color if nothing else.

sv	56 utt3	A	It would mean a lot to the looks of the plate.
	aa	57 utt1	B	Yeah,

bf	58 utt1	A	Tex Mex, Tex Mex.
	aa	59 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	62 utt5	A	we like the real Mexican food better than Tex Mex.
	b	63 utt1	B	Yeah.

qy^g	68 utt1	A	It's all pretty good, isn't it?
	ny	69 utt1	B	yes,

sd	72 utt4	A	and we're in the mountains in Virginia.
	b	73 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	74 utt1	A	And most of the seafood's frozen.
	aa	75 utt1	B	yeah

aa	76 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	77 utt1	B	and in Texas we got it from the Gulf.

sd	78 utt3	A	Lots of shrimp.
	aa	79 utt1	B	And, yeah,

ba	80 utt1	A	I know it .
	sd	81 utt2	B	I was like a man starving at every meal.

sd	82 utt4	A	and when he goes to Maine, he eats lobster, I guess, at least twice a day, all the time he's up there .
	qy^g	83 utt1	B	It's a lot cheaper there, isn't it?

sd^e	84 utt3	A	It's like two ninety eight a pound for a pound lobster.
	sd	85 utt1	B	It's like shrimp on the Gulf.

b	88 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	89 utt1	B	That's as cheap as steaks some places I mean in a grocery store.

sd	92 utt3	A	A lot of the restaurants you can get two one pound lobsters for like ten ninety nine.
	ba	93 utt1	B	my gosh.

sv	96 utt2	A	it's a good place to go.
	sv	97 utt1	B	it sounds wonderful.

sd	98 utt1	A	Lots of little restaurants, too, with home cooked food, that's up there.
	sv	99 utt1	B	That sound good.

b	100 utt2	A	uh huh.
	sd	101 utt1	B	And, it's just so much different than to eat something that's been frozen. You know

sd	104 utt1	A	We went to Gal ,
	sd	105 utt1	B	shrimp straight out of the bay.

sd	106 utt1	A	We were in Galveston last year well, the first of this year, actually.
	b	107 utt1	B	Hm.

sd	108 utt2	A	and they claimed to have the best shrimp on the Gulf coast.
	qy	109 utt1	B	Was it true?

sd	110 utt6	A	and they were set up with two buffets, one for their regular Sunday chicken and roast beef and vegetables and everything. And then one complete seafood buffet.
	b	111 utt1	B	Hm.

sd	114 utt2	A	They had shrimp fixed probably six different ways.
	b	115 utt1	B	yes,

sd	116 utt3	A	It was wonderful.
	sv	117 utt1	B	they can do things to shrimp that no one else can.

b	118 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	qy	119 utt1	B	So, have you eaten crawfish yet?

sd	120 utt3	A	Not there, but at my brothers I tried it.
	sv	121 utt1	B	as with anything, it's preparation.

sd	122 utt5	A	he went down and bought some at a local place that steams them, just so we'd try them.
	b	125 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	126 utt1	A	Probably needed some cold beer with it
	qy^d	127 utt1	B	So you do eat out a lot.

na	128 utt1	A	Quite a bit.
	sd	129 utt1	B	One of our other real problems with going out to eat, Sunday morning brunches.

b	130 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	131 utt1	B	You know, Sunday brunch, all you can eat brunches.

sd	132 utt3	A	but we don't anymore.
	sd	133 utt1	B	we still find it fun.

sd	134 utt4	A	Hate to come away feeling uncomfortable .
	sd	135 utt1	B	Well, I work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor.

qy	138 utt2	A	Like at hotels, or restaurants there?
	ny	139 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	140 utt3	A	We eat at Shoney's.
	b	141 utt1	B	Yeah,

ba	144 utt2	A	that sounds nice.
	sv	145 utt1	B	it, it's the way to spend a nice Sunday morning.

ba	146 utt2	A	I imagine it is.
	sd	147 utt1	B	I think it's as much the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch. {D

qw	148 utt2	A	out of, which direction?
	sd	149 utt1	B	Colorado Springs.

qw^r	150 utt1	A	Out of, which direction from there?
	sd	151 utt1	B	West

b	152 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	153 utt1	B	west out of Colorado Springs.

qw	1 utt2	A	Ellen what kind of a car do you think you're going to buy? .
	sd	2 utt1	B	Well, as a matter of fact, I was thinking about that the other day,

b	3 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	4 utt1	B	But, something that still has a lots of amenities and, you know, gadgets and things.

qy^d	5 utt1	A	you do want a lot of that stuff?
	ny	6 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	7 utt4	A	you said amenities, that they have,
	b^m	8 utt1	B	Amenities.

qw	9 utt2	A	but what about, their reputation of the company or the price.
	b	10 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	11 utt2	A	other people, don't seem to have the same problem .
	b	12 utt1	B	yeah.

b	15 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	16 utt1	B	but, I have preferences for some, makers over others,

b	17 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	18 utt1	B	but, you know, I'm not so totally hung up on that, that I wouldn't buy something else,

sd	19 utt3	A	it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as I expected it to be.
	bh	20 utt1	B	really?

sd	21 utt2	A	but still they cost us money, that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay, on a car that was that new, you know,
	b	22 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	23 utt4	A	well, well, well under two years we had to replace the clutch.
	b	24 utt1	B	Oh.

sd(^q)	25 utt2	A	and I said, since when?
	b	26 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	27 utt1	A	Brake pads are disposable , you know,
	b	28 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	29 utt3	A	but I never thought a clutch was disposable.
	aa	30 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	31 utt2	A	so that was kind of a shock .
	b	32 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	33 utt4	A	they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that, that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable.
	b	34 utt1	B	Right.

sv	35 utt1	A	You would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes, especially not after two years.
	aa	36 utt1	B	No

h	39 utt2	A	I don't know.
	b	40 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	41 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	42 utt2	B	and, even though they do a lot of the work themself just buying the parts and everything is pretty expensive.

qw	45 utt3	A	or like what things are you looking at?
	sd	46 utt1	B	Well, I haven't really gotten that far with it,

b	47 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	h	48 utt2	B	but, I guess, I really don't know.

sd	49 utt3	A	I guess the commercials are getting to me, the Toyota commercials,
	b	50 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	51 utt1	A	and I know that a lot of people I've known that have had Toyotas have been just extremely happy with them, hardly had any problems at all.
	b	52 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	53 utt1	A	I think they have a really good, quality.
	aa	54 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	55 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	56 utt1	B	and, you knew it had been through a whole lot,

b	57 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	58 utt1	B	and yet, you know, it held up pretty doggone good,

sv	61 utt1	A	They seem to be really durable.
	b	62 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	63 utt3	A	but I don't know, if the next time I'm going to try to stay with buying something American or if I'm going to go for a little more, what I would consider to be a long term investment .
	b	64 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	65 utt1	A	it's easy to get gas mileage in this car,
	b	66 utt1	B	Yeah

sd	67 utt1	A	it gets excellent gas mileage.
	aa	68 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	69 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	ad^t	70 utt1	B	Well, we talked long enough .

aa	71 utt1	A	I think so.
	b	72 utt1	B	Okay,

ft	73 utt2	A	thanks .
	fc	74 utt1	B	Bye bye.

sd	2 utt1	A	Actually, I'm real close to being in the market to buy a car.
	b	3 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	4 utt2	A	they're both over ten years old
	b	5 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	6 utt2	A	but I kind of would like to get a more, gas efficient car and a newer model, something looks a little nicer.
	b	7 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	10 utt2	A	and so I need to make sure I've got one that I can fit, all five of us into.
	b	13 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	14 utt1	A	And if you know anything about teenagers it's kind of hard to get them to sit together for any amount of time.
	aa	15 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	18 utt1	A	Well, I've kind of been leaning towards a Caravan.
	b	19 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	20 utt3	A	and, couple times I've had a opportunity to rent one
	b	21 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	22 utt2	A	and because if you get the seven passenger version you can put some space between the kids.
	b	23 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	24 utt2	A	Plus it's got, good storage capacity in it for, you know, taking things along, going to the store,
	b	25 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	28 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	29 utt1	B	and you can move around.

aa	30 utt1	A	Exactly correct.
	qy	31 utt1	B	is that the Dodge Caravan, that does that

sd	34 utt5	A	usually there's a double seat behind the, front buckets.
	b	35 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	36 utt3	A	Now what you can do is you could take that middle seat out and just have the three seats in the back, and the two seats up front,
	b	37 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	38 utt5	A	You can move, the seats all around.
	b	39 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	40 utt2	A	About the only thing you can't do is take that three person across seat, and move it forward.
	b	41 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	44 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	45 utt1	B	and you can, move them around and stuff

b	46 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	47 utt1	B	and right now we have a van which is,

b	48 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	49 utt2	B	But, next year we'll probably buy a new car

sv	52 utt2	A	I think that's getting to be kind of important now that, the price is becoming the driving factor,
	b	53 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	54 utt3	A	and then you looked to see how well you could afford it .
	b	55 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	56 utt1	A	Or how you could afford it.
	sv	57 utt1	B	Well, I think it's going to be a lot easier now.

b	58 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	59 utt2	B	I think banks are going to be a little bit more lenient.

sv	60 utt2	A	I know they're trying to do everything they can to, end the recession.
	b	61 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	62 utt3	A	so I got a, nine and a half percent interest rate.
	b	63 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	64 utt2	A	But, that is also effecting buying a new car .
	b	65 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	66 utt1	A	Well, that and that,
	sv	67 utt1	B	Balance that and the house payment,

na	68 utt1	A	two fourteen year olds will be, fifteen on the fourth of July
	qy	69 utt1	B	are they twins?

sd^e	70 utt2	A	they're twins born on the bicentennial.
	ba	71 utt1	B	wow.

sd	74 utt1	A	So, I've still got another full year and three months before they're going to be behind the wheel, of a car.
	b	75 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	76 utt5	A	You know, they're, they're small enough that a first time driver could handle it, yet big enough that I feel safe that, if they were in an accident they would survive.
	b	77 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	80 utt2	A	I don't get that kind of feeling with the kind of car like you talked about, the Honda.
	sd	81 utt1	B	Well, the Honda's have been very safe. in accidents, more so that a lot of the American cars.

bh	84 utt1	A	Is that right?
	sd	85 utt1	B	Matter of fact I just heard something today on the news about those, automatic seat belts that are attached to the door

b	88 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	89 utt1	B	they're questioning the safety of those now saying that,

ba	90 utt1	A	Jeez.
	sd	91 utt1	B	So they're saying they're not as safe as,

b	94 utt1	A	Yes.
	sd	95 utt1	B	And you're, you're required to wear them.

sd	98 utt4	A	and then there's one, a lap belt.
	aa	99 utt1	B	Exactly.

ad	102 utt1	A	Make sure you smack him around then .
	sv	103 utt1	B	So, I mean, it kind of gives you a false sense of security.

b	104 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	105 utt1	B	So, that, that's a concern of mine as far as, what I'll be looking at with buying a new car.

sd	108 utt3	A	a good source of information I've found has always been these, used car manuals because you can flip through the used car manuals
	b	109 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	112 utt1	A	And you can look at the track record on, a car over the year,
	b	113 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	114 utt2	A	and, you usually notice, a lot of problems at the beginning and then things kind of iron out, to where, there's fewer problems.
	b	115 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	118 utt3	A	Now as long as they aren't changing the model, you know, like when the, Pontiac Grand Prix went from being a huge car to a small car they had a lot of problems, with the smaller car.
	b	119 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	120 utt2	A	As long as they aren't,
	aa	121 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	122 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	123 utt1	B	and in, I think around nineteen eighty, they changed the model

aa	124 utt2	A	sure.
	sd	125 utt1	B	Literally, I mean it got chopped in half

sv	126 utt4	A	So unless they're really changing the model, yeah, chances are that it's probably going to have the fewer mistakes than it had the year before.
	b	127 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	128 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	129 utt2	B	And my husband had a Honda,

aa	132 utt2	A	I agree.
	sd	133 utt1	B	So, so we ended up,

qy^d	1 utt2	A	he did really decide to go?
	qy^d@	2 utt1	B	to Williams College in Massachusetts? And that he was trying to decide between University of Pennsylvania and Williams,

sd	3 utt3	A	I'm familiar with it,
	sd	4 utt2	B	and it was a very difficult choice

qy^d	5 utt2	A	he must have a definite profession in mind.
	o@	6 utt2	B	but that's one of the reasons why he chose Williams that it has solid liberal arts, * end of slash unit? About two thousand, / * should be indep slash unit. See B.8

qy	11 utt1	A	Is he excited?
	sd	12 utt1	B	Very excited,

h	15 utt3	A	but there you go.
	sd	16 utt1	B	Well, they're, they're really very strong academic rather than, you know, big sports,

qw	17 utt3	A	where you at?
	sd	18 utt1	B	We're outside of, Washington in Maryland.

sd	19 utt2	A	I'm in, suburban Dallas.
	b	20 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	21 utt4	A	We don't have any kids yet.
	b	22 utt1	B	Okay,

sv	23 utt1	A	About all I can say is I guess about picking schools, I guess, if you don't know what you're going to do, liberal arts program is a good idea.
	sd	24 utt2	B	one of the advices we've given our children is that you can always learn a job

aa	25 utt1	A	This is true,
	sd	26 utt1	B	but what you can't learn, on a job, is a good solid well rounded education.

bf	27 utt2	A	the humanities, the history, yeah,
	aa	28 utt1	B	That's right, you know,

aa^r	29 utt2	A	right,
	sv	30 utt1	B	and if you get that you can,

sv	31 utt2	A	but you know, if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school usually a company, if it's worth it's weight, will subsidize,
	aa	32 utt1	B	That's exactly right.

^g	43 utt2	A	right,
	^q	44 utt1	B	do you want to go away,

b	45 utt1	A	Right.
	^q	46 utt1	B	What do you want in a college.

ba	47 utt1	A	Good.
	sd	48 utt1	B	so he wanted to swim in school,

bf	49 utt2	A	So he wouldn't have gone to something like where we're at, in Austin, Texas, University of Texas,
	aa	50 utt1	B	That's right,

sd	55 utt2	A	well I think the other thing is, too, I know I went to a, city high school in Chicago
	b	56 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	57 utt2	A	and economics was the choice
	b	58 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	59 utt1	A	sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school.
	sd	60 utt1	B	He is very, very strong academically,

b	61 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	62 utt2	B	and yet he did wind up having to make a choice.

sd	63 utt4	A	University of Pennsylvania,
	sd	64 utt1	B	It's got about nine thousand undergraduate.

sv	65 utt2	A	that's strong,
	b	66 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	69 utt1	A	and it's, well, it's a little bit, I don't want to use the word wilder, that's not the word I want. more diverse ,
	aa	70 utt1	B	Yes,

qy	71 utt2	A	At Williams,
	sd	72 utt1	B	At Pennsylvania.

qw	73 utt2	A	Well how large is Williams?
	sd	74 utt1	B	Williams is an undergraduate school only

b	75 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	76 utt1	B	and it's a total of two thousand.

ba	77 utt1	A	Well that's not bad.
	aa	78 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	81 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	82 utt1	B	and he had visited his brother at Amherst and knew that he liked the environment

b	85 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	86 utt1	B	but he did go on college visits,

sd	87 utt3	A	and, that has something like either the first or second largest student population, like fifty thousand.
	aa	88 utt1	B	Yes,

sd	89 utt1	A	Combined .
	sv	90 utt1	B	it's large,

sd	93 utt1	A	and this was twenty years ago .
	b	94 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	95 utt1	A	Showing my age,
	qy	96 utt1	B	And did you ever eat at the Blue Bin Diner?

ad	97 utt4	A	well, let's not talk about that .
	aa	98 utt1	B	No

sd	99 utt2	A	I mean I just can't say enough about it.
	sd	100 utt1	B	it

sd	101 utt1	A	Well you know, my husband's an engineer and , a strong liberal arts background with, a graduate degree in a technical field will get him much further than say like a strong, business administration degree than with another M B A on top of it.
	b	102 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	111 utt2	A	but they usually don't.
	sv	112 utt2	B	but, if you're going into,

sv	113 utt5	A	I mean, I think, I think all, I think the majority of people just don't know.
	aa	114 utt1	B	That's right.

sd	115 utt3	A	he looked at criteria such as location, size of school 
	b	116 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	119 utt2	A	I mean a lot of kids just don't even want to go,
	b	120 utt1	B	Yeah,

ba	121 utt1	A	that's not too bad.
	aa	122 utt1	B	Yeah

sv	123 utt2	A	he will enjoy Williams I think and is a good academic,
	aa	124 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	127 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	128 utt1	B	he had a great time

sv	129 utt2	A	and, So he's developing his, internal instincts right now.
	sd	130 utt1	B	and he said it almost back ,

sd	133 utt8	A	it was too different the level of income of lot of the students
	b	134 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	135 utt2	A	and their attitudes was just, beyond my, in terms of drugs, et cetera, which I thought was shocking.
	b	136 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	139 utt4	A	but then I went,
	sd	140 utt1	B	But I did,

b	141 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	142 utt2	B	He had to look at himself.

sd	145 utt1	A	And you're going to get a little bit more input than discipline
	aa	146 utt2	B	yeah,

sv	149 utt3	A	but I just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today, I think the refinement that they get I don't mean specifically or culture but just what you're saying, just a solid background because I just don't think at that age I just don't think that young people know what they want to do. You know
	b	150 utt1	B	Uh huh.

aa	157 utt1	A	That's right.
	sd	158 utt2	B	I told him to look to yourself.

b	161 utt1	A	Yeah.
	^q	162 utt1	B	but if it's a class of fifteen and you need help, you know that it's much easier to do it and especially in the large schools they have lectures

b	165 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	166 utt1	B	and even though they may break it up into smaller groups Penn is known for having graduate assistance teaching.

b^m	169 utt2	A	Video lectures.
	sd	170 utt1	B	They have graduate assistants to teach the smaller groups.

qy	171 utt3	A	did he just make the decision today?
	sd	172 utt1	B	he made the decision, I'd say, about, an hour and a half ago .

ba	173 utt1	A	How funny .
	aa	174 utt1	B	Yeah,

ba	175 utt1	A	That's funny.
	sd	176 utt1	B	I mean, and they were really nice,

bf	177 utt2	A	He knew what he didn't want
	aa	178 utt1	B	Yeah,

qy	181 utt1	A	Did your other son,
	sd	182 utt1	B	My other son is just as happy as a bed bug.

bc	183 utt1	A	A clam.
	sd	184 utt2	B	the moment he knew, he decided early on that Amherst was the school.

ba	185 utt1	A	wonderful.
	sd	186 utt1	B	and he also got into the graduate school of music as an undergraduate for classical guitar,

b	187 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	188 utt2	B	but he decided he was going to go to the, the smaller now, and then graduate school later.

bf@	191 utt3	A	* I think this should be a slash unit, since A's next utterance follows B's longer turn And now he's a senior / * should be an indep slash unit
	sd	192 utt1	B	Well, my older boy's real happy,

qrr	193 utt2	A	or is this early admissions?
	sd	194 utt1	B	he's going to be a junior.

sv	197 utt2	A	well sounds like you have two talented sons.
	sd	198 utt1	B	Well, you know, see the advice we give is to not limit yourself, especially this, you know, go to a school where you're not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two.

sv	199 utt3	A	but I think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return
	b	200 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	201 utt2	A	and I think it's rather sad,
	sd	202 utt1	B	Well, one of the things we said is that they should pick the college,

sv	203 utt1	A	You are wonderful parents .
	sd	204 utt1	B	Well, we place a real high priority on education in our family.

sd	205 utt5	A	I'm thirty something and taking my L S A T s on June tenth.
	ba	206 utt1	B	good,

sv	209 utt1	A	The point being, and your sons will learn this from you, I'm sure, that, no matter what age you are, you can learn
	aa	210 utt1	B	That's right,

sd	1 utt1	A	I'm actually at work.
	b	2 utt1	B	o , .

sd	3 utt2	A	I'm in facilities and happen to have, weekend duty here.
	bk	4 utt1	B	okay.

sd	5 utt1	A	I'm in the South Building.
	bk	6 utt1	B	okay.

sd	7 utt3	A	there's three of us, facilities' managers are covering the off shifts. Just to have somebody here, from management to, see if they need anything.
	bk	8 utt1	B	okay.

qw^t	9 utt2	A	how many calls have you made?
	sd^t	10 utt1	B	I've only made a few.

ad	15 utt1	A	Go ahead, you first .
	aa	16 utt1	B	Okay,

ba	17 utt2	A	good.
	sd	18 utt1	B	When the phone rings and you've got a recording, and this always happens like around five or six o'clock, at night. It rings and you get this recording

b	19 utt1	A	Okay, yeah.
	sd	20 utt2	B	and then it won't go away

sd	23 utt5	A	and then when they actually start off with a computer, and expect you to talk to a computer, that's where I draw the lin , I just hang up immediately, you know.
	b	24 utt1	B	Uh huh.

^h	27 utt1	A	shut my other radio off here .
	b	28 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	29 utt4	A	and I have one too,
	b	30 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	31 utt1	A	and they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long, if they catch your answering machine,
	bf	32 utt1	B	They can leave their whole spiel on it.

sd	33 utt4	A	But they can certainly, block your answering machine so someone else calls you, and your answering machine is full, you know, it won't erase.
	b	34 utt1	B	Huh.

sv	37 utt2	A	That was a good one.
	aa	38 utt1	B	yeah,

b	39 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	40 utt1	B	And so it really doesn't make much difference as to whether or not, you know, you have a unlisted number or not.

b	41 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	42 utt2	B	or they sell their catalog list of people, to different companies and everything.

sv	47 utt4	A	it seems to me that you you kind of yell into it.
	aa	48 utt1	B	Right.

sd	49 utt4	A	He actually, ruins my privacy you might say because the, the T I offices are so open anyway. that I'm amazed that, the fact that I'm about ready to say something, if he's even thought of that that's a real uncourteous thing, an invasion of everyone else's time and concentration to just be loud.
	b	50 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	51 utt3	A	that's, perhaps not quite an invasion of privacy
	b	52 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	53 utt4	A	we both picked phone items there.
	aa	54 utt1	B	yeah.

ad,qy@	55 utt1	A	Go ahead, do you have any more? / * Seems to be 2 slash units
	^h	56 utt1	B	Let's see, I'm trying to think.

ad	59 utt2	A	but go ahead.
	sd	60 utt1	B	Well, I work in the computer science center

b	61 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	62 utt1	B	And, this was a software program that a company was developing that was going to have X amount of million peoples financial history and information on it.

b	63 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	64 utt1	B	And, they finally, stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused, because it was such a big deal.

b	65 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	66 utt2	B	And I wouldn't have been too thrilled about it either.

sd	67 utt3	A	I'm a, talk show person.
	b	68 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	69 utt2	A	I'm a radio person I guess is what I mean.
	b	70 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	71 utt1	A	And so I listened to, was it five seventy, which has continuous talk on the weekends, and Neil Sperry and everybody, I mean, the lawyers and veterinarians and all that.
	b	72 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	73 utt3	A	even your Social Security number, you know, you should just put down the basics and put N A, where you don't want to answer.
	b	74 utt1	B	Huh.

sd	77 utt3	A	and I was curious as to you know, what specific things you did have to put down.
	b	78 utt1	B	Huh.

sd(^q)	81 utt1	A	But if you don't feel like putting it down, just put N A, you know.
	b	82 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b^r	83 utt2	A	yeah.
	sd	84 utt2	B	and there it is.

b	85 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	86 utt1	B	They just want that credit history to see if you're a person.

sd	87 utt8	A	and no one was, I guess, really too concerned about it, yet in Austin, there were, whether it was a class action or how far it got, I don't really know because T I only had a few things on T I NEWS I think about it, that they were objecting to
	b	88 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	89 utt3	A	some people object to that which I don't mind, no problem at all, you know.
	sd	90 utt1	B	I know that there's several people I've talked to that really have a problem with it

b	91 utt1	A	Huh.
	sd	92 utt2	B	so you get kind of used to, to going through stuff like that.

b	93 utt2	A	right.
	sd	94 utt2	B	You know, you don't pay any attention to it. I mean,

b	95 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	96 utt1	B	once you sign over your soul to Uncle Sam, , you know, you just kind of, kind of blow it off

sd	101 utt2	A	I served my time too, yeah.
	sd	102 utt1	B	So, I think the people who have been down that route or have had to deal with anything like that have learned, you know, it's just one of those things.

b	103 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	104 utt1	B	But I do know that there are several sites .

qy	105 utt1	A	did they object too?
	ny	106 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	109 utt4	A	it doesn't bother me that whether they do it in high schools or, you know, carry it to wherever you want to carry it really, of course, that would really be a big thing in a public school
	b	110 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	111 utt3	A	and I think it is, they found that it's been very low really.
	b	112 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	113 utt2	A	I don't really know if, they need to publish that really.
	sv	114 utt1	B	I don't think it's a necessary thing to publish it they just need to deal with it and, , on an individual basis.

aa	115 utt1	A	Right.
	sv	116 utt1	B	I mean, if they're going to do it, just deal with it and, be done with it.

sv	121 utt2	A	but it's something that is for the good of so many people, you know, to, have everyone, take the test right away
	b	122 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd(^q)	123 utt2	A	and hopefully, maybe some people will convince other people that are on drugs that, well, I might as well get off, you know, if I want to stay so, you know, if that was an invasion of privacy maybe it was good.
	sv	124 utt1	B	I, I think it's a safety factor too because, you know, when people are inebriated, whether it's alcohol or drugs or whatever, they are very unsafe for their co workers, you know, it's like, you know, my father was a fireman

aa	127 utt1	A	sure.
	sd	128 utt2	B	and I can just imagine if, you know, , you know, some guy being on drugs they go there

b	129 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	130 utt2	B	and they fall out because of the drug issue, you know. I mean you can forgive somebody because all of a sudden they maybe get hurt or whatever that you can understand / * Seems that there should be a slash after 'you know'

b	131 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	132 utt2	B	but the use of drugs or anything like that, will, be a problem.

sd	1 utt5	A	and we have a really high turn over rate.
	bh	2 utt1	B	really?

sd	5 utt2	A	you really don't.
	ba	6 utt1	B	That's good.

b	7 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	8 utt1	B	I never really thought about that,

sd	9 utt8	A	you have the pick of you know, the crop here.
	qy	10 utt1	B	Are they big into ambiance down there

b	11 utt1	A	Oh!
	sd	12 utt1	B	Texas to me makes

bf	13 utt1	A	You know, your fourteen ounce steak with your potato and stuff.
	aa	14 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	15 utt5	A	You can get as dressed up or, you know just going to the local barbecue and just doing take out.
	b	16 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	19 utt5	A	it's good stuff, you kno ,
	b	20 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	21 utt4	A	but, you know, you get a great variety of things here,
	b	22 utt1	B	Yeah.

qw	23 utt3	A	But if you were going to a restaurant, say, where would you go?
	sd	24 utt1	B	well we have a lot of favorites here, in Northern Virginia

b	25 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	26 utt1	B	and there's all sorts of things down there.

bk	27 utt1	A	okay.
	sd	28 utt1	B	and he's got a big clientele

b	29 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	30 utt1	B	we don't hang around with them, because usually it's, you know, ninety dollars a plate or something silly like that.

aa	31 utt2	A	right .
	sd	32 utt1	B	So, but, my wife has a friend that runs one of the restaurants down there

b	33 utt1	A	I see.
	sd	34 utt1	B	And, most French food always leaves me hungry for some reason.

aa	37 utt1	A	That's true too.
	sd	38 utt2	B	but the atmosphere is just wonderful.

aa	39 utt2	A	yeah.
	sd	40 utt2	B	Well as out here you might have enjoyed the meal and go away feeling satisfied, it's not so much an event, you know, out in the suburbs when you go to a local restaurant.

b	41 utt1	A	Yeah,
	sd	42 utt1	B	And they're starting to get a little bit different,

sd	45 utt2	A	You know, you go out
	b	46 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	47 utt2	A	and you eat your crawfish and jambalaya and stuff.
	b	48 utt1	B	Yeah

sd	49 utt5	A	so, he and a friend of his get together
	b	50 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	51 utt5	A	So when we do go out we really, you know, want to be wowed by, the presentation, so to speak.
	b	52 utt1	B	Right.

sd	53 utt2	A	and like I said, some of our very favorites are the Chinese restaurants,
	b	54 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	55 utt1	A	and we do a lot of take out because everybody's so busy running around,
	b	56 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd,o@	57 utt2	A	and so we sort of enjoy you know, both parts because, * slash unit, because A's next utterance is a backchannel of B.58 Uh huh. / * Should be indep. slash unit
	sd	58 utt1	B	We have two very special places in Northern Virginia that people go to.

b	63 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	64 utt1	B	Maryland is, you know, a big place for crabs with the bay pretty much taking over most of Maryland.

b	65 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	66 utt1	B	And, Captain Pell's is a place with the big huge wooden tables inside,

bf@	71 utt1	A	Just to be abused, by the meanest waitress . * slash unit that's a talent. / * Indep. slash unit
	sd	74 utt1	B	And people come all over the country amazed at, the abuse they were seized.

^2^g	81 utt1	A	Got to carry through with the abuse, huh.
	aa	82 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	83 utt13	A	and they are all singing arias to you and, and just walking around the restaurant singing
	ba	84 utt1	B	wow.

qy	1 utt1	A	So, do you fish?
	ny	2 utt1	B	yeah.

qr	3 utt1	A	from a boat or from shore?
	sd	4 utt1	B	From the dock, from shore.

qy	5 utt2	A	mostly catfish
	sd	6 utt1	B	mostly we catch carp.

qy	7 utt2	A	A real light line, real light rig?
	ny	8 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	9 utt1	A	Well, that sounds like fun.
	sd	10 utt1	B	They fight hard.

sv	11 utt1	A	Fish in Colorado different than that.
	bh	12 utt1	B	Yeah?

sd	13 utt1	A	Mostly trout in the mountains.
	b	14 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd^e	15 utt3	A	mountain streams and rivers.
	qy	16 utt1	B	Are they good to eat?

sd^e	17 utt2	A	Yeah, very much there, you know.
	qy	18 utt1	B	you mean size wise they're not very big?

sd^e	19 utt2	A	but they're big fun.
	b	20 utt1	B	Yeah.

br	21 utt1	A	What?
	qy^r	22 utt1	B	Are you fly fishing

sd	23 utt1	A	I, I'm a fly fisherman.
	b	24 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	25 utt4	A	but it's fun.
	sd	26 utt1	B	I've never even tried that.

qy^d	27 utt2	A	You're not casting a weight on the end of the line?
	ny	28 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy^d^r	29 utt1	A	You're casting the weight of the line.
	sd	30 utt1	B	With the little thing on the end.

sd	31 utt2	A	well, the fly on the end weighs nothing.
	b	32 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	33 utt2	A	It weighs less than the line.
	b	34 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	35 utt1	A	So what you do is, you strip off, four, five, six little rolls, coils, of line into your hand.
	b	36 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	39 utt1	A	As you whip it, over your head, or side to side, you slowly feed out more and more.
	b	40 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd^e	43 utt3	A	You fish upstream.
	qy^d^m	44 utt1	B	you fish upstream?

sd	45 utt2	A	And then you let it carry it downstream.
	b	46 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	47 utt2	A	and you do it again.
	bf	48 utt1	B	You hope that they think it's a bug and, and eat it.

aa	51 utt2	A	exactly.
	b	52 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	53 utt2	A	from what I'm seeing and hearing and all, the big pattern that's really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern.
	br	54 utt1	B	That's a fish?

sd^e	55 utt3	A	it looks like a grub.
	bf	56 utt1	B	it's a lure.

sd	57 utt3	A	a lure, a fly.
	bk	58 utt1	B	I see.

sd	59 utt1	A	Whenever you have something that looks like something else
	b	60 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	61 utt1	A	and it's a fly, you call it a pattern.
	b	62 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	63 utt1	A	All right, you know, there's bumble bee patterns excuse me. there's bumble patterns, there's mosquito patterns, there's wasp patterns, there's grub patterns.
	b	64 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	71 utt3	A	And, They seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in Fall.
	b	72 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	77 utt1	A	You know how that changes, the phase of the moon
	na	78 utt1	B	I guess so.

sd	79 utt3	A	I, You see, I'm from west Texas.
	sd	80 utt2	B	but bait tends to work the best, just some blood bait.

ny	83 utt1	A	Yeah.
	qw	84 utt1	B	Where are you from?

sd	85 utt1	A	Lubbock.
	sd	86 utt1	B	I'm from Midland.

bf	87 utt1	A	another west Texan.
	sd	88 utt1	B	I went to college at Tech,

ny^r	89 utt2	A	yeah.
	b	90 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	91 utt1	A	It, It, it's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day.
	sd	92 utt1	B	I didn't catch anything,

sd	97 utt1	A	Well, there you fish mornings and evenings. And nights.
	aa	98 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	101 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	102 utt1	B	Just from the heat of it all.

sd	103 utt1	A	It, at times, gets incredibly hot here.
	bh	104 utt1	B	It does?

qy	105 utt1	A	June?
	sd	106 utt1	B	We were in Mesa Verde Park,

b	107 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	108 utt1	B	And it was twenty eight, twenty nine degrees.

b	109 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	110 utt1	B	We did not know what to do about it.

sv	111 utt2	A	it's a total experience, you know, getting out in nature and, hearing the crickets, and listening to the birds and, seeing the squirrels and, camping out, and eating out, of doors
	b	112 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	121 utt2	A	I just freeze.
	b	122 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	123 utt3	A	well, you know, ankle deep or standing on the bank, and slipping it out there.
	sd	124 utt1	B	That's cold water around there.

sd	127 utt1	A	You know, I always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it, out there,
	bk	128 utt1	B	I see.

sd	129 utt3	A	The water's kind of,
	aa	130 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	131 utt3	A	and, the next thing you know, your knees are wet.
	b	132 utt1	B	Yeah.

na	135 utt1	A	got a stepdaughter.
	b	136 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	137 utt2	A	And, at times she enjoys it, at times not.
	b	138 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	139 utt1	A	A fuzzy little dog.
	sd	140 utt1	B	I have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old.

b	141 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	142 utt1	B	And the little one, of course, could care less.

b	143 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	144 utt1	B	The, three and a half year old has just gotten to the point,

b	145 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	146 utt1	B	And he started trying to cast it.

sv	147 utt2	A	you guys sure want to be out of range.
	sd	148 utt2	B	He understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw, but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in.

sv	149 utt1	A	It takes time.
	b	150 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	151 utt4	A	And we still had a good time out, of the deal.
	b	152 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	155 utt1	A	and Colorado is a beautiful place to live.
	aa	156 utt1	B	yeah.

sd	157 utt2	A	you've got to work for a living.
	aa	158 utt1	B	Well, yeah,

qw	159 utt1	A	What division you all in?
	br	160 utt1	B	I'm sorry, what?

qw^r	161 utt1	A	What division are you all in?
	sd	162 utt1	B	We're both,

sd	165 utt1	A	Well, the only thing up here, is division one.
	sd	166 utt1	B	And he's in school, and everything else.

bh	169 utt1	A	yeah?
	sd	170 utt1	B	Kathy and Kevin Guy.

b	171 utt2	A	Yeah.
	b	172 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	173 utt1	A	fishing's, fishing is fun up here.
	sd	174 utt1	B	So that would be neat to, try it some time.

sd	177 utt2	A	But it is fun.
	b	178 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	179 utt1	A	You know, the experience is better up here, I think.
	sv	180 utt1	B	long as you have a good time, that's the main point

sv	183 utt1	A	You know, it seems more relaxing, there's more to look at.
	aa^m	184 utt1	B	Definitely more to look at.

sv	185 utt1	A	and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul . You know, if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake,
	b	186 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	191 utt2	A	it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden.
	aa	192 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	193 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	194 utt2	B	and I guess the creek, the mountains were really starting to melt,

sd	195 utt3	A	it gets foamy almost.
	b	196 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	197 utt1	A	And you know it's just pure and pristine. And the froth
	b	198 utt1	B	Yeah.

ny	49 utt2	A	uh huh.
	ba	50 utt1	B	How nice.

ba	55 utt2	A	that's really wonderful.
	aa	56 utt1	B	It is,

b	57 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	58 utt1	B	And, you know, just so that they get to know their grandparents, but also for help .

b	59 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	60 utt1	B	we don't have that luxury.

sv	63 utt1	A	Well they keep you hopping, I'm sure.
	aa	64 utt1	B	They definitely do.

sv	65 utt2	A	and I think it's excellent because she's getting qualified quality time for, her musical, talents her sports abilities
	b	66 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	71 utt2	A	but that hasn't been, possible.
	b	72 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	73 utt1	A	And, she's tried many, avenues
	b	74 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd(^q)	75 utt1	A	and so now it's just, you know, that she's kind of resolved herself that, yes, this is going to be the only one .
	aa	76 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	77 utt1	A	And they're focusing on all of her, welfare.
	b	78 utt1	B	Uh huh,

bk	79 utt1	A	okay.
	sd	80 utt1	B	And they're part of the Plano Children's Civic Chorus.

b	81 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	82 utt1	B	And they're going to Washington, D. C. next December . to sing for President Bush at the White House at Christmas time.

ba	83 utt1	A	how wonderful.
	qy	84 utt1	B	Isn't that neat?

ba	87 utt1	A	Well, that's wonderful.
	aa	88 utt1	B	Yeah,

aa	89 utt1	A	they are.
	sv	90 utt1	B	and I'm sure when your children grew up you didn't, you know,

aa	91 utt1	A	No.
	sd	92 utt1	B	I certainly don't remember my parents running me here and there and supporting me in all these things,

sv	95 utt1	A	Now I think everything is doing, doing, doing, out of the house. Which can be very hectic.
	aa	98 utt1	B	Yeah,

bf	101 utt2	A	it wasn't so he ,
	sd	102 utt2	B	But on the other hand, we just love watching the kids play and getting to know the other parents

sv	105 utt1	A	You have to look on that, on the, positive side of that.
	sv	106 utt1	B	It's just different.

sd	107 utt2	A	it is.
	b	108 utt1	B	Yeah.

bf	109 utt1	A	It's just a different lifestyle.
	b^m	110 utt1	B	It's just very different.

aa	111 utt1	A	Yes.
	b	112 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	115 utt2	A	and I know what you're talking about when he's involved, you know, the children are involved in that,
	b	116 utt1	B	Uh huh.

o@	117 utt6	A	know, * slash unit or part of previous slash unit? Yes. / * slash problem, should be ny
	bh	118 utt1	B	really.

ba	121 utt2	A	And, I know where you're coming from
	b	122 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	123 utt1	A	and it's very nice.
	aa^m	124 utt1	B	It is very nice.

sv	125 utt1	A	I think, those type of children, that are involved in things like that, their, goals are going to be set higher than the average child that are not participating in things.
	aa	126 utt1	B	Well, I think so,

bf	133 utt1	A	a, a team effort,
	aa	134 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	137 utt2	A	That's really is nice to have in your background, that, you know, then you're, you can be very flexible.
	b	138 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	141 utt1	A	And, there's less, friction involved in relationships when you add that skill of teamwork.
	b	142 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	145 utt1	A	And, I mean a lot of people that are adults are having to go back and learn those basics when our children are already learning that.
	aa	146 utt1	B	Yes,

sv	147 utt1	A	And I think it's a a, a giant step of progress, I really do.
	aa	148 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sv	151 utt1	A	The best of, Well, Cathy, I think if you look to the Word of God and, think on the things that are pure and lovely
	sd(^q)	152 utt1	B	Besides don't sweat the small stuff .

ad	155 utt2	A	and, keep your mind off of negative things.
	b	156 utt1	B	Uh huh.

ad	157 utt2	A	and stress that to your children.
	b	158 utt1	B	Uh huh.

ad	159 utt1	A	And, even if they're discouraged, tell them that that's just a passing moment and to dwell on those things that are, not negative and that are positive things in their life
	b	160 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	163 utt2	A	and when you employ the Word of God there's nothing as powerful as the Word of God.
	aa	164 utt1	B	Absolutely.

aa	165 utt2	A	That's right.
	^q	166 utt1	B	And you owe that back to God because he's given you that ability and that talent

b	167 utt1	A	Uh huh
	sv	168 utt2	B	and and that's real nice.

aa	169 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	170 utt2	B	I'm real proud of her.

sv	171 utt1	A	Well, if she looks, if she looks at it as you suggest that that's, that she can give h , her talent back to the Lord for His glory and she can look at it that way and, that's ...
	b	174 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	1 utt3	A	but now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports.
	b	2 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	3 utt1	A	Well before we had kids, we was in a motorcycle group, you know,
	b	4 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	5 utt3	A	We took, just our little tents,
	b	6 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	7 utt2	A	Then when we started having children we bought a camper. You know,
	b	8 utt1	B	uh huh.

sd	9 utt2	A	and we did it that way.
	ba	10 utt1	B	how neat.

sd	11 utt1	A	So, we've always enjoyed camping.
	b	12 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	13 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	14 utt1	B	And then I bought a van

sd	15 utt2	A	Now we have friends with a van,
	b	16 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	17 utt1	A	and when they go on vacation a lot of times they'll just sleep in the van, you know.
	b	18 utt1	B	Right.

sd	19 utt2	A	and the next night they'll stay at the motel, you know, or something like that.
	b	20 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	21 utt1	A	And they enjoy it.
	b	22 utt1	B	Yes,

sd	25 utt2	A	 me either.
	sd	26 utt1	B	All the bugs and stuff .

sd	29 utt1	A	I hate to be on all that stuff .
	sd	30 utt1	B	but I try, you know, to get out there and enjoy everything.

ba	31 utt1	A	yeah.
	sd	32 utt2	B	But what was so fun though is that I had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends

b	33 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	34 utt1	B	and it's all over him.

aa^r	35 utt2	A	yes.
	fe	36 utt1	B	shoot.

sd	37 utt3	A	I mean, it's not something I'd want to do real often.
	b	38 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	39 utt1	A	I'm a sissy.
	b	40 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	41 utt1	A	I either want to do it in the fall or spring.
	aa	42 utt1	B	Right.

qh	43 utt1	A	You know?
	bf	44 utt1	B	Definitely when it's cool.

aa	45 utt1	A	Yes.
	qy	46 utt1	B	Well, have you done much camping around Texas?

ng	47 utt1	A	Well, not really because usually it's when we go off, you know, like for a couple weeks or so.
	b	48 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	51 utt1	A	It's usually like that.
	b	52 utt1	B	Yeah.

na	53 utt1	A	Just about.
	ba	54 utt1	B	Wow.

na^r	55 utt1	A	Just about.
	sd	56 utt1	B	See now I haven't so that,

sd	57 utt1	A	it really is.
	b	58 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd^r	59 utt1	A	It really is.
	b	60 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	61 utt1	A	Also I said we mostly did ours before we started a family.
	b	62 utt1	B	Right,

sd	63 utt1	A	It's a lot easier then.
	sd	64 utt1	B	Well, I know my parents like to camp a lot,

b	65 utt1	A	uh huh.
	sd	66 utt2	B	They said they've got the white beaches and the sand,

b	67 utt1	A	Yes.
	sd	68 utt1	B	and it's not real populated so they feel like they're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean.

b	69 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	70 utt1	B	And, from what I understand from them it's really, really pretty there.

sd	71 utt3	A	You know, I just like to go.
	b	72 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	73 utt1	A	I really do.
	qy	74 utt1	B	Well, have you done much camping up in Kentucky and those parts, in the mountains?

sd	77 utt4	A	But usually if we're with a group of people we really don't stay any one place very long.
	b	78 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	79 utt1	A	You know, like if we're just going through and they camp one night and then head on.
	b	80 utt1	B	Right,

sd	81 utt1	A	But now that we have children and we go every blue moon, I'd rather just go to Galveston. You know .
	b	82 utt1	B	Yeah

b	89 utt1	A	Yes.
	sd	90 utt1	B	But we're getting more into it

b	91 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	92 utt1	B	so that's good.

sd	93 utt5	A	But by the time we really get a chance to it's July, you know,
	b	94 utt1	B	Right.

sd	95 utt1	A	and it's so hot.
	b	96 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	97 utt1	A	And our camper doesn't have an air conditioner.
	b	98 utt1	B	yeah.

sd	99 utt3	A	I'm sure you could put one in probably,
	b	100 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	101 utt1	A	but we hadn't did that.
	b	102 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	105 utt2	A	And you know, they're in like scouts and stuff like that, you know, so, they get to go camping in those organizations also.
	b	106 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	109 utt2	A	I don't, when they do that.
	b	110 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	111 utt2	A	But, That really is.
	b	112 utt1	B	Yeah.

qw	115 utt1	A	Well, how old is your boys, your children?
	sd	116 utt1	B	Well, I, well, I have, a son that's, going to be eleven here pretty soon, and then a daughter that's thirteen.

b	119 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	120 utt2	B	So, they're getting old enough to where they can help out with a campfire and, cooking and all that kind of stuff too.

b	123 utt2	A	Yes.
	ba	124 utt1	B	So, that's really neat.

sd	125 utt2	A	Mine's eleven and eight.
	b	126 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	127 utt1	A	So, they really enjoy it too.
	b	128 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	133 utt3	A	You know, they love to go camping.
	b	134 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	135 utt1	A	they would all the time they wanted, you know, wanted to because there's nothing holding them back.
	b	136 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	139 utt1	A	But I'm just not that involved in it.
	aa	140 utt1	B	No,

b	141 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	142 utt1	B	But not on the regular basis.

b	145 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	146 utt1	B	and I just couldn't do that, you know.

sd	149 utt2	A	I don't know what you would do every , you know.
	b	150 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	153 utt1	A	But I guess, my entertainment's, television, I guess .
	^2	154 utt1	B	Just getting away.

b	157 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	158 utt1	B	But every Friday night they'll go home, you know, straight from work

b	161 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	162 utt1	B	But anyway that's their life .

^g	163 utt3	A	don't they?
	ny	164 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	165 utt1	A	Well, see, we're in a real small county area,
	b	166 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	167 utt1	A	and, you know, that makes a big difference.
	aa	168 utt1	B	Now that's true.

sd	169 utt1	A	Because if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles, you know .
	aa	170 utt1	B	Yeah

fc	173 utt1	A	It was nice talking to you too,
	fc	174 utt1	B	Okay.

fc	175 utt1	A	and we'll probably be talking to you again.
	fc	176 utt1	B	Okay,

fc	177 utt2	A	bye bye.
	fc	178 utt1	B	Bye bye.

qy	3 utt4	A	do you have an idea of how much.
	nn	4 utt1	B	No,

b	5 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	6 utt1	B	I'm only twenty nine.

bk	7 utt1	A	okay.
	sd	8 utt1	B	So, social changes aren't that much for me either.

sv	9 utt4	A	and maybe that's changed a lot. the way people dress
	b	10 utt1	B	Well, yeah,

br^m	13 utt1	A	More lax?
	aa	14 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sv	17 utt1	A	Maybe a people are a little more open minded than maybe they used to be.
	sd	18 utt1	B	I think so.

b	19 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd^r	20 utt1	B	I think so,

sv	25 utt2	A	Especially with like a lot of the different organizations now like, you know, Pro Life and Pro , Choice in the special interest groups maybe like amnesty.
	b	26 utt1	B	Right.

sv	27 utt3	A	maybe people are a little more, free to express their opinions, socially free.
	aa	28 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	31 utt1	A	Right.
	sv	32 utt2	B	and and like you said, pro choice and whatnot.

b	37 utt2	A	Right.
	sv	38 utt1	B	I think that's become more outstanding than it used to be where women, I think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something.

sv	39 utt2	A	Just wasn't socially acceptable.
	aa	40 utt1	B	No,

sv	41 utt4	A	and we have to worry about, maybe people are becoming more, more afraid of relationships.
	b	42 utt1	B	Right.

b	45 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	46 utt2	B	and, you know, we didn't have to talk about,

b	47 utt3	A	Yeah.
	sd	48 utt1	B	but, I'm not naive, to think that my children are not going to not do it.

b	51 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	52 utt1	B	It wasn't that long that I was that young.

b	53 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	54 utt1	B	And I've got a ten year old,

b	55 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	56 utt2	B	and it's just different things you have to talk to them about now that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about.

sv	61 utt4	A	It's a it's a much different,
	b	62 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	63 utt3	A	you can't just hope for abstinence.
	aa	64 utt1	B	No,

b	65 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	66 utt2	B	and it always will be,

b	71 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	72 utt1	B	I mean, the boys are very open because that's all I have is boys, so that's all I'm around basically, is boys,

b	75 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	76 utt2	B	but they talk about things that my brother didn't talk about until he was in college you know,

b	77 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	78 utt2	B	and they sit down

aa	79 utt1	A	That's right.
	sd	80 utt1	B	You can't give them, the, you know, Cabbage Patch answers and stuff.

b	81 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	82 utt3	B	that just does not go.

b	83 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	84 utt1	B	And they can tell me, basically some things that I don't know .

b	85 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	86 utt1	B	But it's interesting, listening to them.

sv	89 utt7	A	kids are a lot more educated now than I think that, like we were, at that age about a lot of things.
	aa	90 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	91 utt6	A	and, students learn it earlier.
	sd	92 utt1	B	I know,

qy	1 utt2	A	what are your favorite things to watch?
	^h	2 utt1	B	let's see,

b	3 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	6 utt1	B	some comedy shows, I can not think of, off hand,

b	7 utt1	A	Yeah.
	qw	8 utt1	B	but, what are your,

sd	9 utt4	A	I like that real well. And CHEERS
	b	10 utt1	B	Yeah.

qy	13 utt3	A	do you ever watch that?
	ny	14 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	15 utt3	A	I was sort of sorry to see it go too.
	b	16 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	19 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	20 utt2	B	I think it had some good situations that it presented.

sd	21 utt3	A	like the problems that Michael and Hope had in their marriage and stuff, I can relate to some of those things.
	b	22 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	23 utt1	A	Just the dynamics of it and everything.
	sv	24 utt1	B	Well, I think a lot of people, you know, kind of felt that way,

b	25 utt1	A	really.
	sd	26 utt2	B	and you know, that they called interaction between people and sort of to use as, as a way of getting people to talk about their problems,

b	27 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	28 utt1	B	and that sort of thing .

b	29 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	30 utt1	B	that tends to, put a cramp in your viewing, because by the time you get through getting her ready for bed and everything, it's, very little T V time left.

bf	31 utt2	A	you are too tired to do anything.
	b	32 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	33 utt2	A	it's better to spend time with your kids, I think though, than glued in front of the T V anyway.
	aa	34 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	35 utt2	A	I don't think there's as many good things to watch as there used to be, really.
	aa	36 utt1	B	No,

b	37 utt2	A	yeah.
	sd	38 utt1	B	I notice it's like, it's like THIS OLD HOUSE,

b	39 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	40 utt1	B	But, it's kind of interesting because they renovate an old house

sv	41 utt4	A	it is interesting.
	aa	42 utt1	B	Yeah,

qy	43 utt1	A	Do you watch sports much on T V?
	ny	44 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	45 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	46 utt2	B	but, baseball to me is a little hard to watch on T V, for an extended period.

sv	49 utt1	A	It's slow.
	aa	50 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	53 utt2	A	But, you can not take a whole lot of that either,
	b	54 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	55 utt2	A	it's pretty slow.
	aa	56 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	59 utt2	A	we went to the movies a lot on weekends and watch them at home, because there's just, on Friday and Saturday nights there's nothing good on
	aa	62 utt1	B	Right.

b	63 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	64 utt1	B	I know we have done that too in the past,

b	65 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	66 utt1	B	But, you know, we used to rent, two or three movies on a weekend and try to watch.

qy	67 utt2	A	Do you have cable T V?
	nn	68 utt1	B	No,

sd	69 utt1	A	We do not either.
	sd	70 utt1	B	we live in,

sd	71 utt1	A	I thought we were the only ones , who did not have it.
	aa	72 utt1	B	No.

b	75 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	76 utt1	B	but when they built our section did not put it in

ba	77 utt1	A	Gosh.
	sd	78 utt1	B	and they still do not have it

b	79 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	80 utt2	B	I have contacted them about this

b	81 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	82 utt1	B	and so they look

sd	87 utt5	A	we just had all the normal ones, that come
	b	88 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	89 utt4	A	and it seemed like we did not watch even half an hour,
	b	90 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	91 utt3	A	that's the only thing.
	aa	92 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd^t*	95 utt1	A	Well, I can not, think of too much else to say. * typo cannot? Since we are not big watchers.
	b	96 utt1	B	Right.

fc	99 utt1	A	Well, it was nice talking to you.
	fc	100 utt1	B	Alright,

qy	1 utt1	A	Well, if you had to pick a type of music that you like, would you be able to? / * functions as a qw
	nd	2 utt1	B	Well, I could pick country music. / * answered as if to a qw

qy^m	3 utt1	A	Country music?
	sd	4 utt1	B	As I've gotten older, I've started listening more to the words of music and to the softer melodies.

o@	5 utt1	A	* slash error are you from Texas? / * slash error
	ng	8 utt1	B	Not originally.

qw	9 utt2	A	Where you from?
	sd	10 utt1	B	Georgia.

sd	11 utt4	A	so , I'm kind of in a different category here.
	qw	12 utt1	B	If you had to pick one, what would you choose?

h	13 utt18	A	so, there you go .
	sd	14 utt1	B	Well, I understand what you're saying.

sv	17 utt4	A	It's always about some guy losing some girl and then, you know, playing the guitar and singing about it.
	sd	18 utt1	B	Well, there's some joy in it also.

qy	21 utt3	A	Do you consider her country?
	no	22 utt1	B	I don't know.

sv	23 utt2	A	That would be good.
	sd	24 utt1	B	Well, I like groups like the Statler Brothers. And the Judds, certainly.

sv	27 utt2	A	I must admit yeah, they're fantastic,
	sd	28 utt1	B	Reba McIntire is a little too country for me.

sv	29 utt2	A	She's got so much energy .
	aa	30 utt1	B	That's true.

qy	31 utt3	A	is she kind of country?
	ny	32 utt1	B	yes.

b^r	33 utt1	A	Kind of .
	sd	34 utt1	B	That's certainly where her roots are.

qo	37 utt1	A	how about the Oak Ridge Boys.
	na	38 utt1	B	Very much so.

sd	39 utt6	A	I've picked up a little bit along the way that I probably wouldn't have if I'd stayed up north, you know.
	aa	40 utt1	B	That's true.

sv	41 utt5	A	But maybe twenty years from now they'll look at it as classic rock and roll which I really like
	sd	42 utt1	B	Well, it's just difficult for me to believe that anybody's ever going to make a record of the rap songs of the eighties.

aa	43 utt3	A	right,
	b	44 utt1	B	Yeah

sd	45 utt3	A	so, I mean, if it stands the test of time, we'll see.
	aa	46 utt1	B	That's true.

sv(^q)	47 utt2	A	if it survives, then it'll just probably be one or two songs that sort of, hey listen what we listened to .
	b	48 utt1	B	Yeah

sd	49 utt4	A	and, you know, all these rock stations call it classic soft rock, you know .
	b	50 utt1	B	Right.

sd	51 utt1	A	But we used to listen to it full blast .
	aa	52 utt1	B	Of course.

qy	53 utt4	A	Well, you got any more?
	sv	54 utt1	B	Well, the big key is that, I think you've already stated, that all music is rooted in the classics

co	59 utt3	A	and, I'll look at some country.
	ba	60 utt1	B	You bet.

fc	61 utt2	A	Bye bye
	fc	62 utt1	B	Bye bye.

sd	1 utt6	A	And I feel like that now if I had gone to a small college that only had a couple of thousand that I wouldn't have gotten as much exposure to different people and I don't know, different languages, different cultures, and things like that just by being around those fifty thousand students.
	ba	2 utt1	B	That's interesting,

b	5 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	6 utt1	B	And I thought that was the best experience in that we had more one on one since we seemed to know everyone on campus,

b	7 utt1	A	Huh.
	sd	8 utt1	B	and we had a broad spectrum of languages and cultures and backgrounds, and so forth,

b	9 utt1	A	Huh.
	sd	10 utt2	B	so, I thought it was wonderful to be a bigger fish and not so much a number,

b	11 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	12 utt1	B	one of fifty thousand, I was one of three thousand, and, you know, different perspectives,

b	17 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	18 utt2	B	but it sounds like we were both kind of looking at the same sort of thing.

sd	19 utt4	A	so, actually, yes, you were a number.
	b	20 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	21 utt6	A	and I'm sure a lot of people come to, you know, small colleges also but just that they're more of the different cultures there,
	b	22 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sv	23 utt2	A	but I'm just saying that I think that big,
	sv	24 utt1	B	That's one thing to definitely consider.

sd	25 utt12	A	I have my friends,
	b	26 utt1	B	Uh huh

sd	27 utt1	A	and I'm really not as concerned about the entire city, so when you go to a big university, you're not as concerned , about the entire university, but your group of friends, your classes, your interests, your clubs and things like that.
	b	28 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	31 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	32 utt2	B	and whereas some would immediately feel very comfortable in this, larger university setting, some of the students, when I was teaching school would not have been comfortable with that.

b	35 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd(^q)	36 utt1	B	They needed, at least at first, they needed a smaller setting that was more like family where they could get one on one, from teachers, professors and so forth, and then after a year or two move on to a little bit bigger pond where, when they had a little more self confidence built up, yes, I can do this, I've done this before, it's just in a bigger setting,

b	41 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	42 utt1	B	and so maybe to me the key would be what is a the, the students needs,

b	43 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd@	44 utt1	B	and what school or schools can best meet those needs besides education yo , you can expect all of them with, a , accreditat , accreditation to give the education / * seems that this should be 2 slash units, the second starting at "yo "

b	45 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	46 utt2	B	but they're the things that don't show up in,

^2	47 utt1	A	On paper.
	aa	48 utt1	B	That's right,

sd	49 utt10	A	but it wasn't like a real priority.
	b	50 utt1	B	Right.

sd	51 utt2	A	and one other point I was going to make, was that I can see that probably if I had gone to a smaller school, I would probably have more friends, because like you said, you know, you know, everybody knows everybody,
	b	52 utt1	B	Huh.

sv	55 utt2	A	you may walk into a company and see someone you went to school with, more so at a small college then a large college.
	b	56 utt1	B	Uh huh.

^h	59 utt3	A	I guess, let me think of another important thing to look at when you look into college,
	sd	60 utt1	B	I guess now I've been out for,

b	61 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	62 utt1	B	And I was looking at an annual last night,

b	63 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	64 utt1	B	and it was church related.

b	65 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	66 utt1	B	And I got to looking at my class of sixty nine,

b	67 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	68 utt1	B	and I realized that even though that school's two hundred miles from here

ba	69 utt1	A	Wow.
	sd	70 utt1	B	and it's neat to know that we have that contact that goes back that some of the same memories if not the same education in,

b	71 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	72 utt1	B	you know, we weren't all out to be teachers or whatever

ba	77 utt1	A	That's great.
	sd	78 utt1	B	And it's, it's kind of neat just knowing that those kinds of things, those are what I carry beyond that piece of paper that allows me to be an exempt at T I,

b^r	79 utt2	A	right.
	sd	80 utt1	B	I have something more important to me than that.

sd	81 utt5	A	I've been out of college only two years now, , so it's still pretty fresh on my memory, 
	b	82 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	83 utt5	A	okay, let me go back to my sister now is in college, and my father was really interested in getting her in a school that would look good on her, diploma, etcetera, and so forth,
	b	84 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	87 utt4	A	and I wanted her to get the life experience, out of it,
	b	88 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	89 utt3	A	she went the academic way because she's a straight A student, which is,
	sd	90 utt1	B	I was going to ask who won .

sd	91 utt5	A	but that was the big deal
	sv	92 utt1	B	in that case, regardless of what you or your father pushed for it sounds like she was going for what she needed, and finding a school that met her specific requirements, and made the best fit for her.

sv	97 utt1	A	And that's another point is that, a parent should tell their child to be or to give their child the leeway to choose their school, not so much choose the school for them but, you know, kind of guide them along but let them more or less choose what they need and what they're going to do.
	b	98 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	101 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	102 utt2	B	I could live at home.

b	103 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	104 utt1	B	But I chose to go to another school

b	105 utt1	A	Huh. Right,
	sd	106 utt1	B	and I think I value my education more because I had to work for it.

b	107 utt2	A	uh huh.
	sd	108 utt1	B	And because I knew all along that's what I wanted, even though I had to buck the family in order to do what I needed to do.

sv	111 utt2	A	Well, that was pretty courageous .
	sd	112 utt1	B	I guess it was my mother's support that got me through it, that and ten years of, loans , after I got out .

o@	117 utt2	A	so. * slash error yes, / * slash error
	qy^g	118 utt1	B	Sounds familiar,

sd	121 utt1	A	That memory just seeps back in my mailbox.
	b	122 utt1	B	Yeah,

bd	123 utt1	A	well, I guess I'll get over it.
	sv	124 utt1	B	I'm sure it was worth it though.

aa	125 utt2	A	yeah.
	sd	126 utt1	B	if nothing else because I work in training at T I now,

b	127 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	128 utt1	B	if nothing else just those experiences beyond and including your educational classes that help give you the self esteem to do and achieve, whatever you set your mind on,

b	131 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	132 utt1	B	and you made the right choice in going to a school that met all of your needs to give you the potential to do whatever you wanted.

sd	133 utt3	A	I'm finding out now that what I'm needing the most now is not smarts, not what I can do on paper, it's stamina, courage, ,
	sv	134 utt1	B	Young lady, you have gotten your education then,

sd	135 utt1	A	words, it,
	aa	136 utt2	B	that's right.

sd	137 utt2	A	you know, my, I'm needing to rely on myself,
	b	138 utt1	B	Yeah.

qo^t	1 utt1	A	So what are your feelings on the topic today as far as crime in America today?
	sv	2 utt1	B	Well, I think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and people getting less time and not serving any of the, or a lot less of the, time they're given by the court system,

b	5 utt1	A	Yeah.
	h	6 utt2	B	but, I don't know,

sv	7 utt7	A	I mean, it's like a bonus to go to jail.
	b	8 utt1	B	Right.

sd	11 utt3	A	and, when he uses up all that and spends all that money, then he, starts robbing houses again or whatever and gets caught again and goes through the same thing.
	sd	12 utt1	B	Well, there was an article in our paper Sunday that the average person sentenced to seven to ten years in North Carolina, serves six weeks .

sv	13 utt1	A	Now, see, you talk about, that's a crime right there.
	sd	14 utt1	B	Well, see, we don't have any room in our prisons

sd	15 utt1	A	Well, we don't either, in Texas.
	sd	16 utt1	B	they shuttle them in and shuttle them out

sv	17 utt4	A	it's terrible the way it is right now.
	sv	18 utt1	B	I think the general public is so overwhelmed by things right now, so many different things coming in so many different directions that they've just decided to become apathetic towards it all because they realize there's abs ,

sv	19 utt2	A	as far as steps to reduce crime, if it's, crimes like we're just been discussing, obviously we need more prisons and more corrective facilities to put these people in to, take them off the streets,
	b	20 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	21 utt8	A	it's not right to put them in there and let them live for years and years and w , years before you do execute them or whatever because has to be very costly to feed a prisoner and to clothe him
	b	22 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	23 utt4	A	and everything else, you know, they can have a good time in.
	sd	24 utt1	B	Well, I don't know what the answer is,

sd	27 utt1	A	I'm, I'm pretty much of a hard person,
	sd	28 utt1	B	I hope so.

sd	29 utt4	A	I mean, you know, if it's just downright, outright,
	sd	30 utt1	B	I definitely believe in capital punishment.

sv	33 utt2	A	I mean, that's the only way to,
	sd	34 utt1	B	it's when they're on death row for nineteen years that I'm kind of curious about.

sv	35 utt3	A	it's just unbelievable.
	aa	36 utt1	B	Yeah,

bh	37 utt1	A	Can you really?
	ny	38 utt1	B	Yeah,

ba	39 utt1	A	God.
	sd	40 utt1	B	and then, after that it goes to the Supreme Court of the United States

sv	43 utt1	A	Meanwhile, you're living in a country club situation perhaps, you know.
	sv	44 utt1	B	They're hoping,

b	45 utt1	A	Yes.
	sv	46 utt1	B	But it's just a,

sv	47 utt1	A	The drug problem, that's another one.
	sv	48 utt1	B	The fundamental problem is,

sd	1 utt9	A	so I get most of my news like from documentaries like FORTY EIGHT HOURS, TWENTY TWENTY, you know, the news at night. News in the afternoon, that kind of thing.
	b	2 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	7 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	8 utt1	B	and they have community newspapers around here so their extremely local stuff is in the local paper that comes out once a week

b	9 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	10 utt2	B	and then I get the Sunday, MILWAUKEE JOURNAL because I don't have time to read a paper.

b	11 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	12 utt2	B	I get my news pretty much from the same sources as you do, although I do listen to N P R which has very good, and that's National Public Radio which has very good, coverage of the national and international news, and does a pretty good job of analysis as well.

qy	17 utt1	A	Are you in the car quite a bit
	nn	18 utt1	B	No,

b	19 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	20 utt2	B	and when I'm not teaching, if I choose to have the radio on I can listen to that station,

bk	23 utt2	A	I see.
	qy	24 utt1	B	are you satisfied with the TWENTY TWENTY and FORTY EIGHT HOURS and the things that you do watch?

sd	25 utt3	A	and I watch the news at least twice a day.
	b	26 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	27 utt2	A	and so it seems as if I catch the news right as it happens, you know.
	b	28 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	29 utt6	A	So I usually find out exactly when it happens and that kind of thing.
	qy	30 utt1	B	Is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is the timely noting of the events as they happen?

sd	31 utt3	A	It's just that, now that I've stayed home, I'm usually aware of when these things occurred
	b	32 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	33 utt1	A	and it happened
	sd	34 utt1	B	Well, I, myself, the reason why I listen to N P R and the reason why I watch MACNEIL LEHRER, rather than the network news shows at night, although I do watch a local ten o'clock in the evening news which carries over a lot of the national news stories is that quite often it seems to me the national doesn't do a very good job of analysis.

b^r	37 utt2	A	right.
	sd	40 utt1	B	The local doesn't either

b	41 utt1	A	Uh huh
	sv	42 utt1	B	And perhaps newspapers do that

b	45 utt1	A	Huh.
	sv	46 utt1	B	So. there is some danger to that, of course, too.

sv	49 utt2	A	It kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story.
	b	50 utt1	B	Uh huh.

h	51 utt1	A	That kind of thing.
	b	52 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	57 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	58 utt1	B	I like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture.

sd	61 utt5	A	And it's pretty interesting.
	qy^g	62 utt2	B	you have young children, right?

ny	63 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	qy^d	64 utt1	B	So those evening shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the T V set for awhile without interruption.

sd^e	65 utt2	A	Plus, I find that I have to video tape quite a bit of things .
	bh	66 utt1	B	you do?

sd	67 utt1	A	If I don't want any interruptions, you know.
	b	68 utt1	B	Uh huh.

h	69 utt1	A	That kind of thing.
	qw	70 utt1	B	When is your good watching time?

sd	71 utt1	A	it seems like ten o'clock at night .
	b	72 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd^r	73 utt2	A	but that's what it seems like, ten o'clock at night.
	sd	74 utt1	B	I have older children and getting dinner on the table.

b	75 utt1	A	Uh huh .
	sd	76 utt2	B	I come from the east coast

sd^t	1 utt1	A	I just pressed my,
	sd^t	2 utt1	B	We're supposed to talk about recent political developments.

sv	3 utt7	A	I think that's kind of an interesting recent thing, that I could think of recently that,
	b	4 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	5 utt2	A	I was wondering what you thought about that getting a general into politics.
	b	6 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	9 utt7	A	and they said in general, generals are more familiar with training, that they believe in training more.
	b	10 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd(^q)	11 utt3	A	So, I thought well, maybe.
	sv	12 utt1	B	I think they probably have a better education than the average congressman.

sv	13 utt9	A	and Schwartzkopf, you know, might make a good, politician, whether it be Governor or whatever, you know.
	sv	14 utt1	B	he, you know, we know he's a good leader,

sv	15 utt3	A	everyone has a boss, of course.
	sd	16 utt1	B	You know, Schwartzkopf was ordered to get Iraq out of Kuwait.

b	17 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd(^q)	18 utt1	B	And so he went to the President and said, okay, here's how I want to do it.

aa^r	19 utt3	A	that's true.
	b	20 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	23 utt2	A	That was, pretty easy
	b	24 utt1	B	Yeah.

ad	25 utt3	A	go ahead.
	sd	26 utt1	B	Well, the thing that I'm wondering about is how we get a new congress.

sd	27 utt1	A	Well, I have an easy answer for that, I wish they would do it, is that limit it, you know, to eight or ten years max.
	b	28 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	29 utt1	A	You know, whether that's two five year terms or whatever.
	b	30 utt2	B	yeah.

ar	33 utt1	A	you know, you're not.
	sd	34 utt1	B	I think if the President, be him Republican or Democrat,

b	35 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	36 utt2	B	I think the reason why we've got these guys in Congress is because of the fund raising rules.

b	37 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	38 utt1	B	Basically the people,

sd	39 utt7	A	that would be my answer of an easy way to get these guys out of there for twenty years.
	b	40 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	41 utt2	A	My God, it's ridiculous, you know.
	sv	42 utt1	B	that's the easy way.

sd	45 utt3	A	I can't believe that a country our big votes for a President from seven o'clock in the morning til seven o'clock at night, you know.
	b	46 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	47 utt4	A	It's just, if you really want the majority of the people to vote then give them a couple of days.
	b	48 utt1	B	Yeah.

b^r	51 utt2	A	yeah.
	sv	52 utt1	B	You know, like, you know, the recent election about how the Dallas City Council should be made up, that election last December.

qy	53 utt1	A	Are you in Dallas?
	ny	54 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	55 utt2	A	I am so happy not to be part of Dallas when I see those folks there.
	b	56 utt1	B	Yeah.

qw	59 utt5	A	what is the woman's name whose, not the mayor but the, / * typo should be who's
	^2	60 utt1	B	The manager.

sv	61 utt4	A	I mean, they're just awful, just awful.
	sd	62 utt1	B	Well, what get's me is this thing, it went down to defeat last December by how many votes, by just a few hundred votes.

b	63 utt1	A	Uh huh
	sv	64 utt1	B	And if it had passed,

sv	67 utt2	A	and then they don't even do that recommendation, you know.
	b	68 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sv	69 utt1	A	I mean, it's amazing the money that they spend once they get in.
	sd	70 utt1	B	but this is supposedly to benefit the minorities,

aa	71 utt1	A	Well you're right there.
	sv	72 utt1	B	and they would have had their way.

sv	73 utt4	A	the voting is still not as much as you think in all kinds of issues really.
	aa	74 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	75 utt3	A	hopefully people will get more involved.
	sd	76 utt1	B	my position is people who don't vote don't have any right to complain about the way the government's going.

sd	77 utt4	A	The guys that don't take any interest in, and constantly on the negative of everything.
	b	78 utt1	B	Uh huh.

bh	79 utt1	A	And, Is that right?
	sd	80 utt1	B	and you ask them why they don't vote,

sv	83 utt4	A	I think they could do more about, voting.
	sv^m	84 utt1	B	I think they could.

sd	85 utt5	A	I could go out and debate George Bush better than I see any Democrat doing it.
	b	86 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	87 utt2	A	because I like competition, you know.
	b	88 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	103 utt2	A	We'll get to politics, I'm sorry .

	aa	6 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	7 utt3	A	plus I like, to listen to music.
	b	8 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	9 utt2	A	is what I really listen to most of the time.
	qw	10 utt1	B	Like what kind of oldies?

sd	13 utt1	A	Usually in the fifties.
	b	14 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	15 utt2	A	I think it's a fifties, sixties, and seventies station that I listen to.
	b	16 utt1	B	Uh huh,

bh	17 utt1	A	really.
	ny	18 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	19 utt2	A	but I know a lot of the old songs.
	b	20 utt1	B	Uh huh,

ba	21 utt1	A	yeah.
	sd	22 utt1	B	and it is excellent.

b	23 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	qy	24 utt1	B	do you listen,

sd^e	25 utt2	A	I have.
	b	26 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	27 utt1	A	I played the accordion for seven years
	o@	28 utt1	B	Really. * slash error at the same time, or, / * slash error should be qy

sd	31 utt4	A	and I played that all through high school.

ny	33 utt2	A	yes.
	b	34 utt1	B	Yeah,

bk	35 utt1	A	okay.
	sd	36 utt2	B	So, and, my wife played flute in high school.

sd	39 utt1	A	And then in concert band I played the bass clarinet.
	b	40 utt1	B	Really

b	41 utt1	A	Yeah.
	b	42 utt1	B	really.

b	43 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	44 utt1	B	Actually that's exactly the same thing my ex wife did .

bh	45 utt1	A	really.
	ny	46 utt1	B	Yes,

sd	47 utt11	A	and I really enjoyed it.
	sd	48 utt1	B	Well, I like it,

b	49 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	qy	50 utt1	B	do you go to listen to much live music?

br	51 utt1	A	Pardon me?
	qy	52 utt1	B	Do you listen to much live music, like concerts or things there?

sd^e	53 utt2	A	I really don't go to very many concerts.
	b	54 utt1	B	Uh huh.

b	55 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	qy	56 utt1	B	You know, you know whom I'm talking about?

ny	57 utt1	A	Yes.
	sd	58 utt1	B	And he's coming to Dallas on the twenty ninth,

ba	59 utt1	A	wow.
	sd	60 utt1	B	My sons are kind of into Broadway.

sd	61 utt1	A	I would love to be able to go see LES MISERABLES.
	sd	62 utt1	B	And he does it,

ba	63 utt1	A	my gosh.
	sd	64 utt4	B	and one of the,

ba	65 utt1	A	Holy smoke.
	sd	66 utt1	B	So, he's been to, they've been to see it several times.

sd	67 utt1	A	I would love to go see that, and CATS CHORUS LINE
	b	68 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	71 utt1	A	I would love to be able to go see those.
	qy	72 utt2	B	don't any of those ever come to Pittsburgh?

sd	73 utt6	A	and so I really didn't have the chance or the money to go see them.
	b	74 utt1	B	Sure.

b	75 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	ad	76 utt1	B	So if it comes to Pittsburgh in the road shows, and I think they have three different companies that tour the U S, you should go see it, because it's really outstanding.

sd	77 utt8	A	and he said it was the best thing he'd ever seen
	b	78 utt1	B	Right.

sd^r	79 utt1	A	and he doesn't even like that type of stuff.
	sv	80 utt1	B	Well, I think it's just incredible.

bh	81 utt1	A	really.
	ny	82 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	83 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	84 utt1	B	And they went to it,

sd	85 utt3	A	He's more into the New Wave music,
	b	86 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	87 utt2	A	I guess, I don't know either, you know,
	b	88 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd(^q)	91 utt2	A	and I thought, my gosh, .
	bf	92 utt1	B	So he listens to New Wave

aa	93 utt1	A	Yeah
	sv	94 utt1	B	That's kind of different.

sd	97 utt1	A	I'll listen to anything basically, except I don't like the real hard metal rock.
	b	98 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	99 utt3	A	I like some country.
	sd	100 utt1	B	Well, now we don't listen to much country,

b	101 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	102 utt1	B	That is excellent.

qy	103 utt1	A	Do you like Randy Travis?
	sd	104 utt2	B	I mean, I've probably heard him,

b	105 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	106 utt1	B	Garth Brooks is probably the only country album we have,

qy	107 utt1	A	Hank Williams Junior?
	nn	108 utt1	B	Nope,

b	109 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	110 utt2	B	so these are a bunch of old recordings.

b	111 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	112 utt1	B	She bought that the same night we bought the Nat King Cole and the Garth Brooks.

sv	113 utt2	A	well, those should be good albums.
	sd	114 utt1	B	It is pretty good.

sd	115 utt1	A	If you have the chance,
	sd	116 utt1	B	it's a little too country for me,

b	117 utt2	A	uh huh.
	sd	118 utt1	B	I like the Garth Brooks album a lot.

b	119 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	120 utt1	B	It's pretty good,

sd	121 utt3	A	He's really country himself
	b	122 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	123 utt1	A	but, you know, I, I really enjoy listening to his music.
	qw	124 utt1	B	which of his albums do you think is the best?

ad	125 utt2	A	If I were you, I would get the Greatest Hits album if he had one, because you know, that would have a mixture of all his, you know, top songs on it.
	b	126 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	129 utt2	A	I can't, you know, name the names of them off hand
	b	130 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	131 utt2	A	and all my brothers and sisters listen to them, even the ones that like the heavy metal they really enjoy listening to him,
	b	132 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	135 utt1	A	You know, maybe if you did like Hank Williams and Garth, you know, maybe you would enjoy Randy Travis.
	sd	136 utt1	B	Well, I think we'll probably get one of his albums, because we do kind of like it,

b	139 utt1	A	Yeah,
	sv	140 utt1	B	So, so it's good.

qy	141 utt2	A	I was going to say do you know any other country singers that you would, you know, I mean, the women, do you like the ,
	ny	142 utt1	B	Yeah,

qo	1 utt4	A	What about you ?
	^h	2 utt1	B	Well, let's see.

b	5 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	6 utt1	B	So, I'm not sure how much I'm getting back

b	7 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	8 utt1	B	It's not too much.

b	9 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	10 utt1	B	Not too bad though .

sv@	11 utt3	A	I guess it's where we have to be, we have to keep raising them to keep some of the things that we have and . It's just scary though about, you know.
	aa	12 utt1	B	Yeah.

qh	13 utt2	A	How high are the taxes going to be when my children are my age?
	b	14 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	15 utt1	A	You know, that's, that's scary too.
	b	16 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	17 utt2	A	So, you know, that's a scary part too, that you have to think about.
	aa	18 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	23 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	24 utt1	B	And, you know, taxes are one of the ways to help pay for a lot of the things that are needed in this society.

b	25 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	26 utt1	B	I mean, everything you know, from medicare to social security to feeding the h , to, you know, feeding the homeless, to maintaining prisons, to maintaining polices or fire departments and things like that.

b	27 utt1	A	Uh huh
	sd	28 utt2	B	but someone has to pay for it

sv	29 utt8	A	and that's kind of scary too .
	b	30 utt1	B	Uh huh

sd	31 utt2	A	I wanted to see that program.
	b	32 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	35 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	36 utt1	B	And, makes you wonder when there's, you know, countries out there that have, you know, tax rates of like close to fifty percent or higher.

b	41 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	42 utt1	B	And that's kind of a scary thought.

b	43 utt1	A	Yeah
	sv	44 utt1	B	But, on the other hand, while those countries that have high taxes, also have things like, socialized medicine, things like that too, which are nice fringe benefits of it.

b	45 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	46 utt1	B	And it's good

b	47 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	48 utt1	B	I mean it can be argued one way or another whether economically it's actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that because those countries have be, tend to have a much slower cash flow and don't generate a, a large amount of revenue because there's so little, currency flow through out the economic system .

sv	51 utt2	A	Well you sure do know a lot .
	bd	52 utt1	B	Well, just keeping up with the times, that's all.

b^r	53 utt2	A	, yeah.
	sd	54 utt1	B	as it turns out, you know, it's one of those interests , you know, I kind of like to keep up on.

b	55 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	56 utt1	B	work hard to get, you know.

aa	57 utt3	A	That's true.
	b	58 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qo	59 utt1	A	What do you think about these items that are going to be, taxed even more. Like, tobacco and that kind of thing .
	sv	60 utt1	B	I think in a way it's good, in a way it's not.

b	67 utt1	A	Right.
	sd*	68 utt2	B	as far as the safety thing, in San Luis Obispo, for example, there's an ordnance which states that, there's no smoking in any public areas. / * typo ordinance

fp	1 utt1	A	Mike, I'm calling from Dallas, from Richardson.
	ba	2 utt1	B	okay, great.

sd^t	3 utt3	A	You know, our subject is on boating and sailing
	b	4 utt1	B	Right.

sd	5 utt1	A	and, quite honestly, with the exception of being involved in a part ownership of a little bass boat, I have never really got into sailing or boating.
	sd	6 utt1	B	I do, quite a bit of sailing.

ba	7 utt1	A	do you, well, great.
	sd	10 utt1	B	and we take it out

ba	11 utt1	A	Well, that's neat.
	sd	14 utt2	B	It's just I don't have a trailer hitch on my car anymore

b	15 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	16 utt2	B	so it's hard for me to get it somewhere

sd	17 utt5	A	it must have slept four people anyway.
	b	18 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	19 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	20 utt1	B	but you couldn't really sleep in there unless you sort of stuck your body out the hole, back into the main part of the sailboat.

ba	23 utt1	A	I I understand.
	sv	26 utt3	B	they can be black holes to throw money into .

aa	27 utt1	A	I tell you, they are,
	sv	28 utt1	B	Boats are kind of expensive to maintain.

sd	29 utt3	A	and I think of all the time, now that my kids are gone and away and married and going to college or whatever, that I put in there, I just could not imagine a boat because I know it's a lot of maintenance.
	sv	30 utt1	B	Especially a bigger one.

ba	31 utt1	A	gosh
	sv	32 utt1	B	The bigger they are, if you get a big cabin cruiser or or a big ski boat, power boat, then there's always, stuff to go wrong with it.

aa	35 utt1	A	You bet.
	sd	38 utt2	B	A sailboat at least doesn't have an engine to mess up,

aa	39 utt1	A	Sure.
	sv	40 utt2	B	It takes a, a pretty good amount of maintenance to keep one up

aa^m	45 utt1	A	It is a lot of fun.
	sv	46 utt2	B	and when you work hard and you're under pressure and everything all week long, a boat can be a lot of relaxation, especially with a group of friends and cook out or camp out or whatever, or a cabin or something, depending on how much you like to rough it.

sd	49 utt6	A	and they go boat.
	^2	50 utt1	B	Use the boat for transportation.

sd	53 utt2	A	if they want to go to the lounge to have a cocktail, they use the boat.
	bf	54 utt1	B	They just go across the boat and tie it up and go in, huh

sd	55 utt8	A	I'm envious, I'm envious of people that have the big boats
	sv	56 utt1	B	That would be fun.

aa	59 utt1	A	You bet.
	sd	60 utt2	B	I might just donate my little one to the scout troop and let them, keep it and maybe consider getting a better one for me.

qy	63 utt2	A	you think you'd really enjoy it?
	ny	64 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	65 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	66 utt1	B	And if you get a big enough one, then you've got a little motor on it also, where if it's light wind, you can still putt around a little bit and have fun.

ba	73 utt2	A	that's great.
	sd	76 utt2	B	and you're just stranded out there trying to pick up what little gusts you can to work your way back in

aa	77 utt1	A	I know.
	sd	80 utt2	B	And if you're a big enough boat to have the little auxiliary motor on there, at least you can kind of drop the sails and putt on back in .

ba	83 utt2	A	Well, that's neat.
	sv	84 utt1	B	But it's fun.

qw	85 utt2	A	Who are you with?
	sd	86 utt1	B	I own an insurance agency, a managing general, a wholesaler of insurance, out in Addison

ba	87 utt1	A	Well, good.
	sd	88 utt2	B	and, I'm a scout leader, though,

qw	1 utt1	A	What are your favorite programs?
	sd	2 utt1	B	it's kind of hard to put my finger on a favorite T V program,

ba	3 utt1	A	how funny.
	sd	4 utt2	B	It's going to be its last show.

sd	7 utt3	A	well I think I've seen it in the distance.
	b	8 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	9 utt2	A	And I have not seen the program.
	by	10 utt1	B	well, That's a shame.

sd	13 utt2	A	people recognized Dallas, Texas, by the Texas, the cowboys and by that program.
	b	14 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	19 utt6	A	It took me a long time, they're talking about the viaducts.
	b	20 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy^g	21 utt2	A	that is right, isn't it?
	ny	22 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	25 utt3	A	I felt really dumb.
	sd	26 utt1	B	Well, it's, it's,

sd	27 utt2	A	I thought it was going to Oak Cliff over the Trinity.
	b	28 utt1	B	Yeah.

bh	29 utt1	A	do they?
	sd	30 utt1	B	One from the east and one from the west.

bk	33 utt1	A	I see.
	sd	34 utt1	B	But it kind of confuses people.

b	35 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	36 utt1	B	And then there's other ones that, deal with, in a funny manner, socially relevant things.

sd	37 utt5	A	I usually read and watch T V.
	b	38 utt1	B	Uh huh.

o@	39 utt1	A	And usually I can handle both at the same time, you know. * slash error Because I am pretty sure where the T V plot's going. / * slash segmentation error, should be independent slash unit
	b	40 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	43 utt2	A	Because it's funny.
	aa	44 utt1	B	Yes.

sd	45 utt2	A	I really enjoy that one.
	aa	46 utt1	B	Yes.

sd	47 utt2	A	and the ones that sometimes will hook me, to put down my book, will be the one, there was one, recently about the Gettysburg Address.
	b	48 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	49 utt1	A	And they wrapped a fictional story around it.
	b	50 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	51 utt1	A	And I thought that was well done.
	b	52 utt1	B	Uh huh.

o@	55 utt3	A	and I'd never miss it for a minute. * slash error Especially the beauty pageants. / * slash problem
	b	56 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	57 utt3	A	I really dislike those.
	sd	58 utt1	B	Well I'm one of those rare guys, who, I rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event, if ever watch one.

"	59 utt12	A	if it's convenient he'll listen to it.
	b	60 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	61 utt1	A	But he just doesn't watch them on T V like he used to.
	sv	62 utt1	B	Well I think it was great when they were, you know, like world champs and they were doing real well.

b	65 utt2	A	Yeah
	sd	66 utt1	B	And, when I came down to Dallas, you know, I found myself rooting for the home team.

sd	69 utt1	A	Well, I actually got to go see them win in the Super Bowl when they went down to New Orleans.
	ba	70 utt1	B	wow.

sd	71 utt2	A	and, that was a lot of fun.
	o@	72 utt1	B	Huh. * slash error Yeah. / * should be independent slash unit

sd	75 utt3	A	But what is a lot of fun to go attend, is this arena football.
	b	76 utt1	B	Huh.

sd	77 utt2	A	I like it so much better than straight football.
	b	78 utt1	B	No,

sd	79 utt2	A	it has a lot of different rules.
	b	80 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	81 utt1	A	The field is half the size
	b	82 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	83 utt3	A	It moves a lot faster.
	sd	84 utt1	B	Gee, I'll have to try to catch that sometime.

sd	85 utt1	A	again I think it may be on cable more than anything else.
	b	86 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	87 utt1	A	We don't have cable.
	aap	88 utt1	B	that's probably true.

b	93 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	94 utt1	B	You know, having movies, back then it was ninety nine cents.

sd	95 utt1	A	They're everywhere, they're on every corner.
	aa	96 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd;sv	97 utt2	A	Everything you've ever wanted to see.
	sd	98 utt1	B	You can see them a lot sooner than you can see them on any of the stations like H B O or Cinemax.

sd	99 utt1	A	Well, and I like to rent tapes because you can put the thing on hold if you get a telephone call or something like that.
	b	100 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	101 utt3	A	the only thing, this DANCE WITH WOLVES, I want to see it in a theater.
	aa	102 utt1	B	yes.

sd	103 utt1	A	Because I understand that, you'll lose fifty percent of it if you don't.
	aa	104 utt1	B	Yeah.

aa	105 utt1	A	That's what I hear too.
	sd	106 utt1	B	And, so I'm hoping I can get her talked into it soon.

sd	109 utt8	A	We will do it.
	ba	112 utt1	B	That's great.

o	113 utt2	A	finally.
	b	114 utt1	B	Yeah.

"	117 utt2	A	my job tends to be very demanding.
	b	118 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy	1 utt1	A	Do you have any personal feelings on the subject?
	sv	2 utt1	B	Well, capital punishment is a hard thing,

b	3 utt2	A	uh huh.
	sd	4 utt1	B	There have been some things, you know,

aa^r	5 utt3	A	I know.
	aa	6 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	9 utt1	A	Well I guess my concern is what we are reading, especially in Texas right now with them letting the people out of jail as soon as they are out of prison and having them go right back the day they get out, back in crime. And especially when they are assaulting, people and then killing people, I mean, the man who, killed those three sheriffs deputies, he is out free, walking the street.
	aa	10 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	15 utt2	A	I have a real problem, with that.
	aa	16 utt1	B	Yeah,

aa	19 utt1	A	I think so.
	sv	20 utt1	B	But, it's something that's really hard to deal with, the way that our justice system is right now, is basically set up in lawyers

aa	23 utt1	A	Right.
	sv	24 utt1	B	They are the ones with the rights.

	aa	38 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	41 utt1	A	and there's no one to face them.
	sd	42 utt1	B	They can get continuances on for years, before the thing ever comes to trial

sv	45 utt2	A	Well, they can not get any, if the judge is going to have any award to the victim, it just puts off their collecting it. / * probably should be cannot
	aa	48 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	49 utt1	A	It's, it's really bad,
	sv	52 utt1	B	I think you know, that there needs to be a way that, you know, once someone has gone through, you know, a trial, I do not know how to fix it.

aa^r	53 utt3	A	uh huh.
	sv	54 utt1	B	You know, when someone has been,

	sd	60 utt1	B	Well, even when someone has been convicted

b	61 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	62 utt1	B	But appealing, you know, and continuing to appeal, like four or five or six times.

qrr	63 utt3	A	or, are there some murders committed that you think leniency should be shown.
	b	64 utt1	B	Oh.

b	67 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	68 utt1	B	Okay, I could see that that might be the situation where, the person could be rehabilitated.

qo	75 utt1	A	And how do you feel about murders of law officers or fire people or something that are, because they have had them, they have had them killed when they have,
	sd	76 utt1	B	Well, what bothers me,

o@	79 utt1	A	* slash error That was their goal. / * slash error

b	83 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	84 utt2	B	and so that's what they did .

bf	85 utt1	A	That would be premeditated .
	aa	86 utt1	B	absolutely.

o@	87 utt1	A	* slash error They killed him. / * slash error
	sd	88 utt1	B	He stopped them for routine traffic violation

b	93 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	94 utt2	B	we had gone out, with he and his wife

b	95 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	96 utt2	B	And these people, you know, in the course of the trial, you know, came up with all these, you know, things about well, you know, they were disadvantaged and all this stuff.

sv	97 utt3	A	there's no reason, for murder.
	b^m	98 utt1	B	And there's just no rea , I mean,

sv	101 utt1	A	I do not care if you are poor or if you are rich or if you are, ugly or what that's just beyond, the,
	aa	104 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	107 utt2	A	and all these kids, they have got an excuse for everything.
	b	108 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv,o@	109 utt3	A	it's just a bad habit, kids have got to learn from the time they are real little, there's no excuse for being bad or making bad choices deliberate or anything. / * 2 slash units?
	b	110 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	111 utt4	A	if especially violent crime, where serial type killer or maybe a child has been deliberately killed.
	b	112 utt1	B	Uh huh.

aa	115 utt1	A	Right.
	sv	116 utt1	B	You know, they stay in jail, they get off time for good behavior and all that stuff, and they get released .

b	117 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	118 utt1	B	And they go right back and do it again.

sv	1 utt5	A	and their real estate up there is, I mean ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous.
	b	2 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	3 utt4	A	and it's just the one, it's a one bedroom.
	qw	4 utt1	B	And how big is it?

sd	5 utt3	A	but I prefer to live in a nice part of town because I feel safe here.
	b	6 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	7 utt1	A	And I, I pay more to feel safe, you know.
	b	8 utt1	B	Right,

b^r	33 utt2	A	uh huh.
	sd	34 utt1	B	and, it's about sixteen hundred square feet, which is fine for the two of us.

b	37 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	38 utt1	B	But it, you know, we looked at a lot of houses that had more square footage,

b	39 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	40 utt1	B	but they didn't use it right, you know.

b	41 utt2	A	uh huh.
	sd	42 utt1	B	It was a bunch of empty, you know, hallway and stuff that cur ,

aa^r	43 utt3	A	yeah.
	aa	44 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	47 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	48 utt1	B	so, you know, I think we you know, got a good deal on it.

sv	49 utt1	A	So that looks good when you all get ready to sell, you'll probably do really well.
	aa	50 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	51 utt3	A	we're originally from the East.
	b	52 utt1	B	really,

sd	53 utt12	A	I know I want a big family area,
	aa	54 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	55 utt8	A	and every,
	ba	56 utt1	B	Wow.

sd	57 utt1	A	I mean, it was just, the ultimate party room, you know,
	b	58 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sd	59 utt2	A	But that's pretty nice.
	sd	60 utt1	B	But that's what we had,

sd	63 utt5	A	I don't like to have a lot of things out, you know, just all over the place,
	b	64 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	65 utt1	A	I like to have them kind of tucked away.
	sd	66 utt1	B	And, so that's what we went for first

b	67 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	68 utt1	B	and, you know, some places have,

b	71 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	72 utt1	B	But to stick a wall between two rooms didn't do anything for us just so we could have a living room and a den.

b	73 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	74 utt1	B	So, we opted for the just, the whole wide room, that went from one end of the house to the other, just about.

sd	77 utt3	A	he had the kitchen, kind of a kitchen and a very long family room,
	b	78 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	79 utt2	A	and what he did, he put, a bar right in the center, and put a glass rack down, so you had like wine glasses hanging from the ceiling and then the bar
	b	80 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	81 utt5	A	Because I personally don't like the combination rooms.
	aa	82 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	83 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	84 utt2	B	and you know, we have a,

b	85 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	86 utt1	B	It is just really,

sd	87 utt2	A	I'd like a big backyard.
	sd	88 utt1	B	And, we really liked it,

^2	91 utt1	A	A little hot.
	aa	92 utt2	B	yeah.

ad	93 utt1	A	Try to do it early in the mornings.
	sd	94 utt1	B	But, it's nice

b	95 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	96 utt1	B	And they've lived there and have it all built up, you know,

ba	97 utt1	A	Wow.
	sd	100 utt1	B	we don't have a neighbor's fence coming up to ours. You know, right up to our bathroom window or whatever it is. Like a lot of the little model homes that they you know throw up in three days.

qr	107 utt2	A	are you looking for a house, or not.
	nn	108 utt1	B	No,

b	109 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	110 utt1	B	in fact, we talked about that just a little bit, you know,

b	111 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	112 utt1	B	we were joking around about, winning a sweepstakes, and what would we do with the money

b	113 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd(^q)	114 utt2	B	and Steve said we'll I'll buy a bigger house

ba	115 utt2	A	really.
	sd	116 utt1	B	You know, you know cause I like where it is

b	117 utt2	A	uh huh.
	sd	118 utt1	B	But when we found it, we knew it.

bf	119 utt1	A	You knew that was it.
	aa	120 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	121 utt5	A	I move a lot anyway, because the job I have I only work,
	b	122 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	123 utt4	A	I can move up,
	qw	124 utt1	B	Where?

sd	125 utt1	A	I'm a news reporter.

sd	127 utt1	A	I work at Channel Six.
	bk	128 utt1	B	okay.

sd	129 utt2	A	so I won't be here very long,
	b	130 utt1	B	Right.

sd	131 utt1	A	so I'm not even looking to buy anything as permanent as house, you know,
	b	132 utt1	B	Right.

sd	133 utt3	A	so. It's no biggie.
	b	136 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	137 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	138 utt1	B	and to put it all back into an apartment would just never work .

aa^r	139 utt2	A	yeah.
	sd	140 utt1	B	God, I can't believe we moved out of an apartment and had this much stuff

b	141 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	142 utt1	B	Of course we got it on, a little bit of more furniture and stuff,

sd	143 utt2	A	like I'm amazed at how much stuff I've accumulated in my apartment, because, up to this point I was in school so I'd go home every summer
	b	144 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	145 utt2	A	and I could take all my stuff home, because I didn't have a bed or a couch or any of that,
	b	146 utt1	B	Yeah.

^q	147 utt4	A	I can't go back home for the summer or anything, I have too much stuff.
	b	148 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	149 utt2	A	so I have to move in apartments just because I have so much stuff.
	b	150 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv^r	151 utt3	A	it's not.
	sv	152 utt1	B	for Waco

aa	155 utt2	A	yeah.
	sd	156 utt2	B	and especially around Lake Shore area, that area's picked up quite a bit since we were there,

sd	157 utt4	A	there are tons of apartments down here, I mean,
	aa	158 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	159 utt4	A	I think they're called Lake Shore Villa or something.
	sd	160 utt2	B	the ones next door to those,

sd	163 utt2	A	there was a nursing home or something right there.
	aa	164 utt1	B	Yeah

b^r	165 utt2	A	uh huh.
	sd	166 utt1	B	And we lived in those third ones

b	167 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd(^q)	168 utt2	B	we drive by now and think, gosh, you know, look how much it's changed

qw	171 utt1	A	How often do you all come through Waco?
	sd	172 utt1	B	every now and then,

bf	175 utt1	A	Depends on what's going on.
	aa	176 utt2	B	yeah,

b	177 utt3	A	yeah.
	sd	178 utt2	B	We used to run to you know, Red Lobster

bk	179 utt2	A	all right .
	sd	180 utt1	B	we don't have to run that far .

b^r	181 utt3	A	uh huh.
	aa	182 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	187 utt2	A	I mean I'm not a real estate person or anything,
	b	188 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	189 utt3	A	and then the houses are all, most of the houses are pretty nice,
	b	190 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	191 utt2	A	and people are pretty stable here.
	b	192 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	193 utt1	A	You know, I kind of see this as kind of a retirement community, as I always call it.
	aa	194 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	195 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	196 utt1	B	And it's nice too.

b	197 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	198 utt1	B	I liked living there.

sd	199 utt3	A	but , I'll deal with it.
	sv	204 utt1	B	I guess we chewed up the house market, and apartment market for a while.

fc	207 utt2	A	okay well it was very nice talking to you.
	fc	208 utt1	B	You too, Tanya.

fc	209 utt2	A	you take care,
	fc	210 utt1	B	All right.

fc	211 utt2	A	bye, bye.
	fc	212 utt1	B	Bye, bye.

qw	1 utt2	A	what types of music do you like to listen to?
	sd	2 utt1	B	Well, I primarily listen to classical music when I have my druthers, partly because I find it more soothing.

sd	3 utt5	A	but I'm not sure which composers or which I really like,
	b	4 utt1	B	Right.

sd	5 utt2	A	so I kind of hesitate to buy something.
	b	6 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	7 utt2	A	There are certain kinds I like and certain kinds I don't.
	sd	8 utt1	B	I tend to listen to the classical music, on the radio a lot.

sd	13 utt2	A	I understand that.
	qy	14 utt1	B	are you involved in music?

sd	15 utt5	A	and I don't sing aloud, to anybody but myself .
	sd	18 utt1	B	Well, my whole family is somewhat musical, and not from training, but just because we sing in our choir

sd	19 utt3	A	I guess I'm real old fashioned in my musical tastes.
	ar	20 utt1	B	No,

aa	21 utt1	A	Yes.
	sv	22 utt1	B	It's loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning.

b	23 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	24 utt1	B	but, the more popular music I don't care for, usually.

b	25 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	26 utt1	B	even when I was a teenager I didn't really like the music of that period so much because I found I liked, a little bit more melodious music than what was often the popular, rock and roll kind of sound.

aa	29 utt1	A	I agree with that too.
	sd	30 utt1	B	Although now I kind of enjoy hearing the rock and roll, I guess it makes me think I'm young again .

sv	31 utt2	A	now rock and roll seems tame compared to like the New Age and all that stuff.
	bh	32 utt1	B	Isn't that the truth?

b	33 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	34 utt1	B	And, you don't hear everything all the time,

b	35 utt1	A	Right.
	sd	38 utt1	B	and I remember my older sister.

b	39 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	40 utt2	B	and she laughed

bf	41 utt1	A	Crops up every so often.
	aa	42 utt1	B	Right,

sd	43 utt2	A	K L T Y.
	b	44 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	45 utt1	A	I like to listen to some of that.
	aa	46 utt1	B	Yes,

b	47 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	48 utt1	B	the problem that I found, in this area is that there, there is inconsistency in the quality here.

b	49 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	50 utt2	B	If you get someone who's very good at selecting, it's okay,

qw	51 utt2	A	where do you live?
	sd	52 utt1	B	I live in the, Washington, D C area, Maryland.

sd(^q)	53 utt2	A	I said, they're playing one of their ten songs.
	b	54 utt1	B	Yes.

sv	55 utt3	A	and they just play them over and over,
	aa	56 utt1	B	Uh huh,

b	59 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	60 utt1	B	But, now my children have sometimes,

sd*	61 utt4	A	He'd buy all the sound tracts he could get his hands on * typo tracks if he had the money to.
	ba	62 utt1	B	wow.

sd	65 utt3	A	and he likes to do special music and stuff at church.
	b	66 utt1	B	Right.

sd	67 utt4	A	He does a good job.
	ba	68 utt1	B	That's nice,

sd^e	69 utt3	A	we're expecting a baby in July.
	ba	70 utt1	B	Well, wonderful.

sd	71 utt1	A	I guess we'll start listening,
	sv	72 utt1	B	That'll be a musician.

sd	73 utt3	A	We'll start listening to children's music .
	sv	74 utt1	B	there's some wonderful Christian, children's tapes. you can get,

sv	75 utt2	A	there are.
	sd	76 utt2	B	and I know when my children were younger, we found a lot of really nice tapes that they liked.

b	77 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	78 utt2	B	my youngest is almost sixteen.

b	81 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	82 utt1	B	there's one that's, a little girl singing Practice Makes Perfect.

b	83 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	84 utt1	B	And, she's playing the piano.

b	85 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	86 utt1	B	And so she gets the wrong note every now and then.

sv	89 utt2	A	that sounds really cute.
	b	90 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	91 utt2	A	and I said, then when it's born you can hold it and sing that again
	aa	92 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	93 utt2	A	and maybe it'll comfort her, you know, when she's fussy and stuff.
	aa	94 utt1	B	Yeah,

qw	95 utt1	A	What?
	sd	96 utt1	B	Because I have always played classical music, or classical style,

b	97 utt1	A	Huh.
	sd	98 utt1	B	Someone else noticed it

ba	99 utt1	A	How strange.
	sd(^q)	100 utt1	B	and I said, well, I guess that's true.

^2	103 utt1	A	Babbly.
	sd	104 utt1	B	you know, it was really funny .

sv	105 utt2	A	Well, we'll have to keep up with that then.
	aa	106 utt1	B	Right,

b	107 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	108 utt2	B	this same child, really listened to more, ballady or, pleasant sort of songs and even classical, rather than the real hard rock stuff that so many other kids listen to.

b	109 utt1	A	Huh.
	sd	110 utt1	B	And I never, I didn't want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and wouldn't do it anymore .

bf	111 utt3	A	have something to rebel against .
	aa	112 utt1	B	Right .

sv	113 utt4	A	variety is good.
	b	114 utt1	B	Yeah.

fc	115 utt2	A	It was real good talking to you.
	fc	116 utt1	B	Well, it was nice talking to you,

fc	117 utt2	A	bye.
	fc	118 utt1	B	Bye bye.

sd	3 utt5	A	his health was failing
	b	4 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	5 utt3	A	and two, that he not be put into a home.
	b	6 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	7 utt5	A	But, I think that, my position is that, you need to find one that you can really have confidence that they are taking care of the, of their clients
	b	8 utt1	B	Yes.

sd	9 utt1	A	and, because I've heard about the many abuses, and because he had heard of so many abuses, he just didn't want that.
	b	10 utt1	B	Yeah,

qo	11 utt1	A	How about you?
	sd	12 utt1	B	Well, my graduate work is in speech pathology,

qy^g	13 utt2	A	all over thirty percent, isn't it.
	ny	14 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	15 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	16 utt2	B	it's difficult for many families, especially in the case of Alzheimer's and, some of the more degenerative diseases to, say, to have them at home, because then the family becomes completely,

sv	17 utt1	A	They're captive.
	aa	18 utt1	B	exactly.

sd	19 utt2	A	We had the Visiting Nurses program
	b	20 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	21 utt2	A	and it was a nominal charge that it started out that the lady would come in I think three times a week and eventually got up to the point where they were coming by every day.
	b	22 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	23 utt4	A	Try to get him to talk and be motivated
	b	24 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	25 utt3	A	and then, I think, he became discouraged
	b	26 utt1	B	Right.

sv	27 utt2	A	and then, at that point I think it's mostly a psychological problem.
	b	28 utt1	B	Oh.

sv	29 utt3	A	There could be a lot of options.
	b	30 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	31 utt1	A	I think it's time that, we decide to do something about it.
	b	32 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	35 utt1	A	I suppose at one time the church would fulfill this need.
	sv	36 utt1	B	Possibly before.

sv	37 utt2	A	the church or synagogue, whatever because typically these were close knit groups at one time,
	b	38 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	39 utt2	A	but in today's large metropolitan areas, or even, even the rural areas now, people are not quite as close as they once were.
	aa	40 utt1	B	Huh uh.

sv	41 utt3	A	there might be some possibilities there.
	b	42 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	43 utt1	A	Although dealing with geriatrics is something a lot of young people just aren't emotionally prepared to do.
	aa	44 utt1	B	I agree.

qw	1 utt2	A	what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time?
	sd	2 utt1	B	Well, I have two children,

b	3 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	4 utt1	B	so I do not have a whole lot of spare time right now.

b	7 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	8 utt1	B	I really enjoy,

b	9 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	10 utt1	B	And then I really enjoy sewing,

sd	11 utt3	A	and we like the water sports too.
	b	12 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	13 utt1	A	But like you, unless you have a pool in your backyard, it is kind of hard to get to do that very often.
	aa	14 utt1	B	I, know it.

sd	17 utt3	A	We are going to have a baby in July.
	b^m	18 utt1	B	Part time.

sd	21 utt1	A	So part of my big hobby has been trying to put together a nursery and all that kind of stuff, lately.
	aa	22 utt1	B	Right.

sv	25 utt1	A	it does.
	qy	26 utt1	B	Is this going to be your first?

ny	27 utt2	A	Uh huh.
	b	28 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	29 utt2	A	So, I have not done that in years,
	b	30 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	31 utt2	A	but I have kind of enjoyed that.
	b	32 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	33 utt1	A	It is just hard to find the time to sit there and do it.
	aa	34 utt1	B	Right.

aa	35 utt2	A	yeah.
	b	36 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	37 utt1	A	And I guess I kind of consider shopping a hobby .
	aa	38 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	39 utt1	A	I just go out just to enjoy it and not really spend money sometimes, just look.
	b	40 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	45 utt3	A	we bought some baby clothes, yeah, last weekend at a garage sale.
	b	48 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	49 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	50 utt1	B	So, I am,

b	53 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	54 utt1	B	On the weekends I drive around, look to see, you know, who is selling what.

b	55 utt1	A	Oh .
	sd	56 utt2	B	and I got them for two dollars .

b	57 utt2	A	Yeah.
	b	58 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv,o@	59 utt2	A	it is kind of a hobby, that is time consuming too, really, to find the things that you want sometimes you have to stop * Looks like, including A.61, there are 3 slash units here at a lot of places.
	b	60 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	63 utt4	A	I am not going to work after the baby comes.
	b	64 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	69 utt1	A	So, I guess, hopefully I will have more time for hobbies.
	ba	70 utt1	B	I am glad,

h	71 utt2	A	I do not know .
	sd	72 utt1	B	Well, at first, when you first have a baby, seems to take every moment of your time. Partly because you are not used to, you know, juggling your time around like that.

b	75 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	76 utt1	B	But I think, my husband is real into sports too.

b	77 utt2	A	Yeah
	sd	78 utt1	B	But the kids enjoy going because there's usually a lot of other kids for them to play with

bf	79 utt4	A	your whole family can enjoy those hobbies.
	aa	80 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	81 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	82 utt1	B	We have never done that before,

sv	83 utt2	A	That will make the summer go by in a hurry.
	aa	84 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	85 utt1	A	Keep the kids busy.
	aa	86 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	87 utt1	A	Right.
	sv	88 utt1	B	So, I think that will be a lot of fun.

b	89 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	90 utt1	B	So we are looking forward to that.

qrr	91 utt3	A	or is that just a chore? .
	sd	92 utt1	B	Well, when I got married, I thought it was going to be fun .

b	93 utt1	A	Uh huh
	sd	94 utt1	B	But my husband and I both, I think, consider it a chore.

b	95 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	96 utt1	B	our yard has had so many problems.

ba	97 utt1	A	no.
	sd	98 utt1	B	And, we have had to start all over trying to plant grass.

b	99 utt1	A	Huh.
	qy	100 utt1	B	Do you and your husband like to work in the yard?

nd	101 utt1	A	well, we like it once in a while but not as often as we have to do it .
	b	102 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	103 utt1	A	I like to put flowers out and, you know, a few little things like that.
	b	104 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	105 utt2	A	But as far as mowing every week, and finding time to get all that stuff done, it gets to be a chore.
	b	106 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	113 utt2	A	They kind of take over and turn into work instead of fun.
	b	114 utt1	B	Yeah.

bf	117 utt2	A	If it does not go quite, quite right.
	aa	118 utt1	B	Yeah.

ba	119 utt1	A	no.
	sd	120 utt1	B	So, I enjoy, you know, cooking things to take over to her house

ba	121 utt1	A	that is nice.
	b	122 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	127 utt2	A	I think I will enjoy cooking more when I am not working, when I do not get home until five thirty or six, and I have to cook and clean up,
	b	128 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	131 utt2	A	But I think I will like it better.
	aa	132 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	133 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv^r	134 utt2	B	It sure does.

b	135 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	qy	136 utt1	B	Well, do you guys go camping or anything like that?

sd	137 utt5	A	there again, it is just so hard to find time to get away for a whole weekend.
	b	138 utt1	B	Uh huh.

ba	141 utt2	A	That sounds fun.
	aa	142 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	145 utt2	A	I think that would be a good family thing to start doing more often.
	aa	146 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	151 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	154 utt1	B	They can go fishing.

sd	157 utt2	A	and, if you can find some place where those little sunfish are right around the shore where they can just pull in a line.
	b	158 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	161 utt1	A	they have so much fun doing that.
	b	162 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	163 utt1	A	And they think they are really great fishermen because they are catching so many .
	b	164 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	167 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd(^q)	168 utt1	B	And I am saying, no, no .

bf	169 utt2	A	Skip this tournament .
	aa	170 utt1	B	Yeah.

qy	173 utt2	A	Do you do any other crafts or anything besides your sewing?
	ng	174 utt1	B	Well, not really right now.

sv	175 utt1	A	It is not too hard.
	b	176 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	177 utt1	A	I do not think it is as hard as like knitting or crochet or something like that.
	b	178 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	181 utt1	A	Yeah
	sd	182 utt1	B	It has been so long since I did it that

sd	183 utt2	A	I started to knit a sweater.
	b	184 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	185 utt2	A	and so what should have been the back all of a sudden was on the front.
	b	186 utt1	B	yeah.

sd	189 utt2	A	and now I can't remember anything about it .
	b	190 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	191 utt1	A	uh huh.
	sd	192 utt1	B	It was a real pretty rug.

b	195 utt1	A	Yeah
	sd	196 utt1	B	And then it was just like I forgot all about it.

^2	197 utt1	A	Forget it.
	sd	198 utt2	B	And every once in a while I will be digging through the closet,

b	199 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	200 utt1	B	But, for a while there latch hook rugs were a real big, hobby.

sd	201 utt2	A	I remember that.
	sv	202 utt1	B	It seemed like people did them a lot.

b	203 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	204 utt1	B	people do not do that much any more.

sv	205 utt3	A	They are pretty easy.
	b	206 utt1	B	Yeah.

fc	207 utt1	A	Well, it has been real good talking to you.
	fc	208 utt1	B	Yeah.

fc	209 utt1	A	And I hope you enjoy your camping trip.
	ft	210 utt1	B	thank you.

fc	211 utt2	A	Bye.
	fc	212 utt1	B	Bye bye.

sd	1 utt2	A	Personal computers.
	b	2 utt1	B	Yes.

qy	3 utt1	A	So, do you use them?
	ny	4 utt1	B	yes,

qw	5 utt2	A	What kind?
	sd	6 utt1	B	its an Emerson eighty eighty six, two low density floppy drives, and no hard drive yet.

qy	7 utt1	A	Mostly for word processing type things?
	ny	8 utt1	B	yeah,

qy	9 utt2	A	Did you buy a program to handle menus?
	sd	10 utt1	B	it came with a menus program,

ba	11 utt1	A	yes.
	sd	12 utt1	B	and hopefully sometime this spring we'll be able to get one and get it configured.

br^m	13 utt1	A	Eighty eighty eight is what you said?
	sd	14 utt1	B	Eighty eighty six.

sv	15 utt3	A	they're so darned cheap now.
	qw	16 utt1	B	Which,

sd	17 utt1	A	Computers.
	sd	18 utt1	B	impoverished college student.

ba	19 utt1	A	no.
	sd	20 utt1	B	This one went on a credit card,

sd	23 utt5	A	and so I'm into computers all the time.
	b^m	24 utt1	B	E D P.

sd	25 utt1	A	Electronic Data Processing.
	bk	26 utt1	B	Okay,

sd	27 utt3	A	and it treats me well.
	b	28 utt1	B	Yes.

qy	29 utt1	A	what are you studying in college computers?
	sd	30 utt1	B	 Computer engineering.

ba	33 utt1	A	How nice.
	sd	34 utt1	B	Well, computer engineering technology, which, all I can understand is it's a slightly more hands on version of computer engineering.

sd	35 utt1	A	How they work is fascinating to me.
	aa	36 utt1	B	yes.

bh	37 utt1	A	Was it.
	ny	38 utt1	B	Yeah,

bf	39 utt1	A	Hardware stuff,
	aa	40 utt1	B	Yeah.

qo	41 utt1	A	What do you think of that fuzzy logic?
	sd	42 utt1	B	I've not had a chance to work with it, although, my, data structures teacher was telling us something about how fuzzy logic works as far as the concept behind it.

b	43 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	44 utt1	B	Now how you'd implement that software wise or mechanically I don't know,

sd	45 utt3	A	I've written a couple of programs for, commercially,
	b	46 utt1	B	Yes.

sd	47 utt1	A	and it's a fun field.
	qy	48 utt1	B	In the fuzzy logic direction?

sd	49 utt6	A	but you have to take into account, you know, with any computer program all the type of things people can do to you to make your program crash or things you normally don't consider.
	b	50 utt1	B	Yeah.

bf	53 utt2	A	pushing keys certain times and, messing up your files and things like that.
	b	54 utt1	B	Yeah.

qy^d	57 utt1	A	And you're going to be an computer engineer type.
	ny	58 utt1	B	yeah,

b^m	2 utt1	A	Okay.
	qw	3 utt1	B	Well what do you think about the idea of, kids having to do public service work for a year?

sv	4 utt2	A	I think they should either do that, or afford some time to the military, or helping elderly people.
	aa	5 utt1	B	Yes,

sv	6 utt3	A	and I'm not sure that that's not a bad idea
	aa	7 utt1	B	That's true.

sv	8 utt2	A	or the military for a year or two, wouldn't be bad for,
	b	9 utt1	B	Yeah.

qo	10 utt3	A	How about yourself?
	aa	11 utt1	B	I agree with you.

sv	12 utt4	A	I really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is two excellent organizations.
	aa	13 utt1	B	They are

sv	14 utt1	A	You know, kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that,
	aa	15 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	16 utt2	A	There are very few Scouts go on, and become Eagle Scouts.
	aa	17 utt1	B	no.

sd	18 utt2	A	and I don't know what the high rank is for the gals
	sd	19 utt2	B	senior.

bk	20 utt3	A	okay.
	sv	21 utt2	B	once they get into junior high it just, not done anymore .

sv	24 utt1	A	and then when they young adults, there's even less interest there.
	b	25 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	26 utt2	A	They're more for, I g ,
	^2	27 utt1	B	Me .

aa	28 utt2	A	yeah.
	sd	29 utt1	B	Grab,

sv	30 utt2	A	you're absolutely right .
	b	31 utt1	B	Yeah

sv	32 utt3	A	of course, there's, you know, third world countries that can use all kind of help .
	b	33 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	34 utt1	A	But I think, we ought to start right here at home.
	b	37 utt1	B	Yeah,

aa	38 utt1	A	No,
	sv	39 utt1	B	But, since there is much that needs to be done here.

sv	40 utt2	A	and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook.
	b	41 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	44 utt1	A	we, I guess we both agree that it's a good thing, that they should do sometime.
	b	45 utt1	B	Yeah.

fc	48 utt2	A	and, enjoy the day.
	fc	49 utt1	B	You, too.

fc	52 utt2	A	Bye bye.
	fc	53 utt1	B	Bye bye.

sd	1 utt2	A	we're going to talk about the public school system, What's wrong with it, or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it, what should be done about it.
	b	2 utt1	B	Okay.

b	5 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	6 utt1	B	Evidently, that's a big problem.

sv	7 utt3	A	I always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough, I mean, to be doing what they're doing,
	b	8 utt1	B	Right.

sd	9 utt6	A	it just, you know, all the problems.
	b	10 utt1	B	Lord, I mean, yeah,

sv	11 utt3	A	I'm sure, because they've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready.
	b	12 utt2	B	right.

sv	13 utt1	A	you know, and they're being paid, probably half what most people being paid.
	aa	14 utt1	B	Exactly,

sd	15 utt1	A	And we're paying basketball people, you know, millions of dollars a year for what, you know.
	aa	16 utt1	B	That's right,

b	17 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	18 utt2	B	what gets me is I can't believe that or, our state legislature can't come up with, some kind of workable means to have funds for the school.

qy	19 utt3	A	Now do you have little kids, or what?
	nn	20 utt1	B	No,

sd	21 utt3	A	my wife and I have a three year old, almost four and a two year old.
	b	22 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	23 utt1	A	So we're looking at the older one going to school next year. not, well not this coming fall but the year after that.
	b	24 utt1	B	Okay,

sd	25 utt2	A	he's going to be going to kindergarten,
	b	26 utt1	B	Right.

sd	27 utt6	A	We're going to be teaching him what we can at home, of course, because, I guess we don't trust the school system, which is very sad,
	b	28 utt1	B	Right.

sv	29 utt2	A	but. But if it doesn't start at home, it's not going to go anywhere. You know,
	aa	30 utt1	B	Exactly.

sv	33 utt2	A	and we're going to try to teach him good values, because, you know, when, when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them, well hey, if you can play football or basketball that's what's important. Not if you can read or write, or un , understand some science. You know,
	aa	34 utt1	B	Exactly.

sv	35 utt3	A	that's, that's bogus.
	aa	36 utt1	B	Right,

sd	39 utt1	A	And Dallas, school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling.
	b	40 utt1	B	Right.

sd	41 utt1	A	I couldn't believe that.
	b^r	42 utt1	B	Right.

b	43 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	44 utt2	B	but, I can definitely, see on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern.

sv	45 utt5	A	That's the only way they're going to fund it, because if they start raising taxes for property, people are going to throw a fit.
	b	46 utt2	B	yeah,

b	47 utt1	A	yeah.
	sv	48 utt2	B	and I don't think any politician's going to do that,

sv	49 utt3	A	if it works at colleges it will work down below.
	b	50 utt1	B	Right.

sv	51 utt2	A	But, it will be hard for those that people, that have in school because they have to pay out even more.
	aa	52 utt1	B	Exactly.

fe	57 utt2	A	I mean, good grief what's .
	b	58 utt1	B	Yeah

sd	59 utt3	A	You never heard about that.
	b	60 utt1	B	Well yeah,

fe	61 utt4	A	like good grief.
	b	62 utt1	B	right.

sd	63 utt4	A	I mean I'm afraid for him to go.
	aa	64 utt1	B	Exactly,

sv	65 utt1	A	But there again , you can't hold them back.
	sv	66 utt2	B	and you want to encourage them, you know, to be active and everything in school,

sd	67 utt4	A	well I graduated high school in nineteen seventy nine,
	b	68 utt1	B	Okay.

qy^d	69 utt1	A	That was what, twelve years ago, I guess.
	na	70 utt1	B	Right.

qh	71 utt2	A	And what's it going to be like in another twelve years when my, oldest son is in high school.
	aa	72 utt1	B	That's right,

sd	73 utt1	A	I'm afraid to even think about it.
	aa	74 utt1	B	yeah, that is a scary thought,

sv	77 utt1	A	you got to be your child's best friend, I guess, even when they're a teenager and they, you know are kind of standoffish,
	b	78 utt1	B	Right.

sv	79 utt2	A	still you got to be their best friend because when they've got problems, who they going to go to, their friends that are dealing drugs, or your parents. You know,
	aa	80 utt1	B	Exactly.

sv	81 utt2	A	and if they go to their friends dealing drugs, they're going to be in even worse shape.
	aa	82 utt1	B	That's right.

sv	83 utt5	A	but, it just is amazing, you know,
	b	84 utt1	B	Right.

sv	85 utt2	A	need to teach them good values.
	aa	86 utt1	B	That's true,

sv	87 utt2	A	And the A C L U is going to get after them and have a lawsuit. Which is going to take twenty years to resolve, you know.
	b	88 utt1	B	Right.

b	91 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	92 utt2	B	that's where they get the deep rooted values

sv	93 utt1	A	That's all you can do.
	sv	94 utt2	B	Then you just have to hope and pray that everything, works out okay,

fc	95 utt2	A	Well I got to be going,
	fc	96 utt1	B	Okay,

fc	97 utt1	A	Nice talking to you today.
	fc	98 utt1	B	You to.

sd	4 utt1	A	I don't care, for acid rock,
	aa	5 utt1	B	Me, too.

sd	8 utt1	A	but, I grew up with country and western,
	b	9 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	12 utt2	A	I even like classical music.
	b	13 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	16 utt2	A	I grew up with Hank Snow, and Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams and all of those old country and western songs.
	b	17 utt1	B	really.

qy	18 utt2	A	did you happen to see last night the special on Channel Two with James Galway?
	ng	19 utt1	B	We don't get Channel Two.

b	20 utt1	A	Oh.
	sd	21 utt2	B	I wish we got that what,

sv	22 utt1	A	That is fabulous.
	qy	23 utt1	B	Was it?

sd^e	26 utt2	A	when he played DANNY BOY it just almost brought, tears to your eyes, because he can make that flute sing.
	bh	29 utt1	B	really?

sv^e	30 utt2	A	and, it was tremendous.
	sd	31 utt2	B	actually, I did,

b	32 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	33 utt2	B	and, so, I, I appreciate his too, his mus ,

b	34 utt1	A	Yeah.
	qy^g	35 utt2	B	he, he's from Ireland isn't he?

sd^e	36 utt3	A	and it was, mostly all Irish tunes,
	b	37 utt2	B	yeah.

sd	38 utt1	A	they had a band with him that, had a harpist and another flute and then a guy that played the bagpipes plus the, tin whistle, and a couple of violins and, drum,
	b	39 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	42 utt2	A	it was just fabulous.
	b	43 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	44 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	45 utt1	B	so, I've played flute, flute and piano,

b^r	48 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	49 utt2	B	I'm getting now to the age where I don't like the new stuff that's coming an , much of the new stuff that's coming out,

b^r	52 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	53 utt1	B	my husband says I'm getting old .

b^r	54 utt1	A	Yeah
	bh	55 utt1	B	Do you?

sd	56 utt2	A	I love to just lay back on the couch and turn a good instrumental on and just close my eyes and listen.
	b	57 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	58 utt3	A	I've always wanted too,
	b	59 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	60 utt1	A	I've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something,
	b	61 utt1	B	Yeah

sd	64 utt1	A	but I'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music
	sd	65 utt1	B	I could never do that .

sd	68 utt1	A	I guess the closest I've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir.
	b	69 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	70 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	71 utt1	B	I haven't done that in a long time.

b^r	72 utt1	A	Yeah.
	^h	73 utt1	B	So, let's see

sd	74 utt3	A	an I don't care for rap music either.
	sv	75 utt2	B	that's not music ,

aa	76 utt2	A	no.
	sv	77 utt1	B	that is not,

sd	78 utt1	A	If I can't understand the words I don't want to listen to it.
	sv	79 utt1	B	Well, it's, it's not, it's not music,

b	80 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	81 utt2	B	it doesn't, it doesn't give you relaxation,

b^r	82 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	83 utt2	B	you can't dance to it,

sd	84 utt2	A	But, and I love, I like orchestra music too. Like the, Boston Pops or, or anything.
	b	85 utt1	B	Yeah.

ny	92 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	bh	93 utt1	B	Have you?

sv^e	96 utt2	A	they're good.
	bh	97 utt1	B	Are they?

sd	98 utt1	A	And, we went and saw, L , LES MISERABLES
	bh	101 utt1	B	really?

sv	102 utt1	A	the music in that was fantastic.
	sd	103 utt1	B	I've heard, I've heard that that is a really,

b	104 utt1	A	Yeah.
	qy^d	105 utt1	B	I heard that was hard to get tickets to.

sv	108 utt3	A	and, it was well worth the price.
	b	109 utt1	B	Yeah.

ny	112 utt1	A	Yeah,
	ba	113 utt1	B	I bet it was,

b^r	114 utt1	A	Yeah.
	ba^r	115 utt1	B	I really bet it was .

sd	116 utt1	A	just ever so often you know, a real good one like that one
	b	117 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	120 utt3	A	that had good music in it.
	bh	121 utt1	B	Was it?

sd	124 utt3	A	I got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it, Helen something.
	sd	125 utt1	B	I know who you're talking about,

sd	126 utt1	A	real long legs, and dark hair.
	sd	127 utt1	B	she's got black hair,

sd	130 utt1	A	I can't think of it.
	b	131 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	132 utt1	A	Yeah,
	sd	135 utt1	B	the last country music,

b	136 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	137 utt2	B	and they like, they like the Oak Ridge Boys and the Statler Brothers,

b^r	138 utt2	A	yeah.
	sd	139 utt1	B	and, well, my, my, my parents,

^2	140 utt1	A	The Blackwoods.
	aa	141 utt2	B	yeah,

b	142 utt1	A	Yeah.
	b^m	143 utt1	B	and, yeah,

^2	144 utt1	A	Alabama.
	aa	145 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	148 utt1	A	Yeah
	sv	149 utt1	B	I get kind, of tire , get tired of every other song being Alabama on the, radio.

^2	154 utt1	A	either Alabama or Hank Williams, Junior.
	sd	155 utt1	B	I've never cared for Hank, Williams, Junior.

sd	158 utt1	A	and I never have figured out how he won, entertainer of the year for about, three or four years in a row.
	b	159 utt1	B	Oh .

b	162 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	163 utt1	B	I just never have.

sd	164 utt1	A	I guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is, probably Eddy Arnold.
	bh	165 utt1	B	is it?

ny	166 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	bk	167 utt1	B	Okay,

sd	168 utt1	A	But, I've got about a hundred and, or had a, some, I sold some of them, I had about a hundred and fifty old seventy eight R P M records of country and western, songs,
	b	169 utt1	B	Yeah.

qy^d	172 utt2	A	Smiley Burnette, I don't know if you were old enough to remember him.
	sd	173 utt1	B	I've heard the name.

sv	176 utt2	A	I think his name in the movie was Froggy
	sd	177 utt1	B	I've never seen a Gene Autry movie,

sd	178 utt1	A	had a real raspy voice,
	o	181 utt1	B	No,

sd	182 utt1	A	some of those old ones, of course, Bob Wills, Miss Texas Playboys Ernest Tubbs and Red Foley an,
	b	183 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	186 utt2	A	I took them up here to Collectors Records and was able to get a little money for them
	b	187 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	188 utt1	A	but, my mother and dad use to, own a restaurant,
	b	191 utt1	B	yeah.

sd	192 utt1	A	and they had a, nickelodeon, of course, in the restaurant,
	b^r	193 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	194 utt1	A	and when they would come and change the records the guy would give her the old records
	ba	195 utt2	B	that's neat.

sd	196 utt1	A	so, that's where I got my,
	sv	197 utt1	B	that would be great if they weren't too worn out, at the time.

sv	200 utt1	A	Of course, there's not a whole lot of market for seventy eight R P M records.
	qy	201 utt1	B	Is there not?

sv	202 utt1	A	Well, the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because, you have to have that, particular kind of needle
	aa	203 utt1	B	Well, that's true.

sd	206 utt1	A	and, they, just won't play on a modern day, phonograph.
	ba	209 utt1	B	Well, that's a shame

b	212 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	213 utt2	B	you'd, think there'd be a market for,

b^r	214 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	215 utt2	B	I'm sure you could find old players for them

b^r	218 utt1	A	Yeah.
	b	219 utt1	B	Oh.

sv	220 utt1	A	Of course, they, you know, just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because, you get that scratchy sound.
	aa	221 utt1	B	No.

ny^r	224 utt2	A	yeah.
	sv	225 utt1	B	You could kill somebody with them .

sd	226 utt3	A	warped real easy.
	sv	227 utt1	B	And the ones you buy,

b	228 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	229 utt2	B	and they're not meant to last, at all,

b	230 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	231 utt2	B	neither are tapes.

b	232 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	233 utt1	B	and machines will eat them,

b^r	234 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	235 utt1	B	and so, the best bet, anymo , these days are compact disk,

sd	236 utt2	A	back then when I was a kid, there wasn't that much T V,
	b	237 utt1	B	no.

sd	238 utt1	A	so that's all you had to listen to was the, radio,
	^2	239 utt1	B	Radio.

b	242 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	243 utt1	B	I think it was better back then to,

b^r	244 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	245 utt1	B	and the radio is, you know, more exciting, really, than television,

b^r	248 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	249 utt3	B	it just didn't vegetate your mind like television does .

sd	250 utt2	A	I remember mother and dad always turned on the Grand Ole Opera.
	b	251 utt1	B	yeah.

b^m	252 utt1	A	Yeah.
	qy	253 utt1	B	Was it on the radio every week?

ny	254 utt1	A	Yeah.
	qw	255 utt1	B	what day, what day was that on,

qw	1 utt2	A	could you tell me what you think contributes most to, air pollution?
	^h	2 utt1	B	Well, it's hard to say.

sv	3 utt3	A	I think probably the greatest cause is, vehicles, especially around cities.
	b	4 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy	5 utt2	A	do you live right in the city itself?
	nn	6 utt1	B	No,

qy	7 utt2	A	so ca , Can you notice,
	qo	8 utt1	B	How about you?

sd	9 utt3	A	I live in a rural area.
	b	10 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	11 utt3	A	I live in Rhode Island.
	b	12 utt1	B	I see.

sd	13 utt3	A	and Attleboro sits in just over the line, where T I's plant is,
	b	14 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	15 utt10	A	they're swinging wider so that now they are coming over our homes.
	b	16 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	17 utt3	A	But, other than that, you know, we don't have unless we're catching it from the midwest, the emissions. You know from the power plants.
	b	18 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	23 utt3	A	but I'm not sure about the rest of the country.
	b	24 utt1	B	Yeah,

bh	25 utt2	A	well, is that right? .
	ny	26 utt1	B	Yeah,

ba	29 utt2	A	surprise, surprise.
	b	30 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	31 utt2	A	there must be, some of the, larger plants up around one hundred twenty eight.
	b	32 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	33 utt2	A	during the night seems like they'd blow off their stacks from, the warehouses, for powerhouses,
	b	34 utt1	B	Right.

sd	37 utt1	A	and, they do that at night too, because, employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted, and, you know, spots all over them.
	b	38 utt1	B	Right.

sv	41 utt2	A	they could do something about, about that, I guess.
	aa	42 utt1	B	Yeah.

qo	43 utt1	A	How are your lakes,
	sd	44 utt1	B	they've been getting cleaner.

qy^d	45 utt1	A	They have?
	na	46 utt1	B	Sure.

sd	47 utt3	A	that's what I was,
	sd	48 utt1	B	I mean the stuff I've read recently in Technology Review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit, overstated. That a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all.

sd	51 utt1	A	upstate New York somewhere, over huge areas,
	sd	52 utt1	B	I haven't read that.

sd	55 utt3	A	and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback.
	b	56 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	57 utt3	A	and I can't remember where.
	b	58 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	59 utt2	A	So, that's interesting because New Hampshire, and parts of Vermont, they showed pictures of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain.
	b	60 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy	63 utt1	A	you kind of think it's something else then?
	nd	64 utt1	B	Well, that's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article.

"	65 utt2	A	they just said they thought it was,
	na	66 utt1	B	They didn't say what,

bf	67 utt1	A	natural disease,
	aa	68 utt1	B	Yeah,

b^r	69 utt2	A	yeah.
	h	70 utt1	B	But, I don't know,

sv	71 utt2	A	I still think that's, one of our major causes of pollutants.
	b	72 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	73 utt1	A	how we go about that, it's a little bit difficult.
	sv	74 utt1	B	I think it's up to individuals too, to ask automakers for, for less pollutant vehicles.

sv	77 utt2	A	yo , ne , I think you need a vehicle something like, Ralph Nader, Nader's Raiders, or, or, A A R P, which has a lot of members. if you can get those types of groups.
	b	78 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	83 utt1	A	Yeah,
	sv	84 utt2	B	and the new cars is, hardly anything.

qw	85 utt4	A	when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch, smoke, or,
	b	86 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	87 utt3	A	fuel is one of their biggest costs.
	b	88 utt1	B	Right.

sd^m	91 utt2	A	diesel engines.
	sv	92 utt2	B	I mean, they do generate a lot of soot

sv	93 utt4	A	This country seems to be a little behind on that.
	b	94 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	95 utt2	A	but only because we got used to, single person, single car, driving.
	b	96 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	97 utt2	A	A lot of people don't even like to carpool.
	b^r	98 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	99 utt2	A	That'll help, air pollution,
	b^r	100 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	101 utt2	A	The, United States and Canada is, is, going into, some types of agreements to limit, what's being given out by power plants,
	b^r	102 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	103 utt1	A	I guess Canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up there,
	b	104 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	105 utt1	A	So that's helping.
	qw	106 utt1	B	Well, what do you think about like a device, a meter right on a tail pipe

ad	107 utt2	A	don't say that too loud though because, every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating revenue,
	sd	108 utt1	B	Well, it just means if you don't pollute, right, or you pollute very little you don't have to pay any tax

qy	109 utt2	A	Is that your idea?
	ny	110 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	111 utt3	A	you could, you could, it could be installed like a catalytic converter.
	b	112 utt1	B	Right.

sv	113 utt1	A	I mean I guess you could take those off too
	sv	114 utt2	B	but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off.

sd	115 utt3	A	well not unless it was built into every muffler.
	b	116 utt1	B	Right.

sv	121 utt2	A	You should, pursue that I think, or patent it, you know.
	aa	122 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	123 utt1	A	If you could come up with a device that's the thing.
	b	124 utt1	B	Right.

sd	125 utt2	A	But that's a thought.
	b	126 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	127 utt3	A	I don't know if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that.
	b^r	128 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	129 utt1	A	but you know a proposal to, I guess the proper authorities,
	b	130 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	131 utt1	A	well you might, generate some
	b	132 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	133 utt4	A	Other than that I'm not sure what individuals can do other than like I said get involved through a group or an organization.
	b	134 utt1	B	Uh huh.

fp	1 utt2	A	How are you?
	fp	2 utt1	B	I'm doing fine.

sd	3 utt2	A	Massachusetts.
	bk	4 utt1	B	Okay.

sd	5 utt2	A	This is quite a long distance.
	aa	6 utt1	B	Yeah,

qy	7 utt1	A	Do you have any pets?
	nn	8 utt1	B	No.

qy	9 utt2	A	You get tired of them?
	sd	10 utt1	B	Well, I live in an apartment building

b	11 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	12 utt2	B	I'd love to have a dog, you know.

br	17 utt1	A	I beg your pardon?
	qw	18 utt1	B	What is she?

sd	19 utt2	A	a toy poodle
	b	20 utt1	B	Ah.

sd	23 utt1	A	This is a little bigger than a teacup.
	b	24 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	25 utt7	A	Well, after you had an animal for a couple of weeks, you become you become attached to it.
	aa	26 utt1	B	for sure.

sd	29 utt9	A	But she's usually pretty good.
	b	30 utt1	B	Yes,

b	31 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	32 utt2	B	But, it, it's it's really made such a difference for her.

b	33 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	34 utt1	B	so I'm unable to, really take care of a pet

ad	35 utt1	A	Well, you might want to get yourself, an animal that doesn't require much attention. Like a cat.
	b	36 utt1	B	yeah.

b	41 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	42 utt1	B	it's just a great cat,

sv	43 utt5	A	 they're, they're affectionate
	sv	44 utt1	B	Well, you don't own cats.

sv	45 utt5	A	I can't seem to communicate with a cat like I can with my dog.
	b	46 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	51 utt7	A	I don't know that a cat would do that, .
	b	52 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	55 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	56 utt1	B	I could just walk in the door

b^r	59 utt2	A	yeah.
	sv	60 utt2	B	It was, uncanny .

sd	61 utt1	A	I think, in a way we're able to read each other pretty well because, she knows when I'm upset and I know when she's not feeling good too .
	b	62 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	63 utt2	A	When when she was younger, she used to do that to get even with me,
	b	64 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	67 utt2	A	but, but, I do .
	b	68 utt1	B	Sure .

sd	69 utt1	A	Like if I put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours, because I was going out. She would, break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to, to let me know that she was unhappy with what I did .
	bh	70 utt1	B	Really?

ny	71 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	72 utt2	B	well, I had that cat that I mentioned, Alfie .

b	73 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	74 utt2	B	and, the next morning, when my roommate got up and, did not feed it right away, it decided that it was going to protest.

sv	81 utt2	A	Animals have a way of talking .
	sd	82 utt1	B	Alfie did.

sd	83 utt11	A	It cost me over five hundred dollars.
	ba,fe	84 utt1	B	Ouch.

sd	85 utt10	A	It's been about two years now.
	ba	86 utt1	B	Well, that's great,

sd	87 utt4	A	I probably would have had second thoughts.
	aa	88 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	95 utt2	A	So that that was kind of a surprise
	b	96 utt1	B	Really.

sd	99 utt4	A	and then the cat, died.
	ba	100 utt1	B	My goodness.

sd	103 utt2	A	So another five or six weeks I'll be bringing the little kitten over to my folks.
	sv	104 utt1	B	Well, that, that, that will make their day.

sv	105 utt4	A	I think they enjoy that.
	bf	106 utt1	B	Only work initially.

aa	107 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sv	108 utt1	B	For cats anyway, you know.

fc	111 utt1	A	Well, the same here.
	fc	112 utt1	B	And you take care.

fc	115 utt1	A	Bye now.
	fc	116 utt1	B	Maybe we'll talk again sometimes .

qw	117 utt2	A	What is that sound?
	sd	118 utt1	B	That's my buzzer at the door .

fc	119 utt2	A	I'll let you go.
	fc	120 utt1	B	Okay.

fc	121 utt1	A	Right .
	fc	122 utt1	B	Thank you .

sd	1 utt2	A	but, I don't know if its their proposal or one that's being seriously kicked around.
	b	2 utt1	B	No,

sv	3 utt2	A	I've always felt for a long time that I think that all young kids ought to do a stint, primarily in the military.
	b	4 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	9 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	10 utt2	B	I don't know about the young women,

sd	13 utt1	A	I mean, everybody does.
	b	14 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	15 utt3	A	I mean, I went in the service when I was eighteen, And, stayed in for ten years.
	b	16 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd^e	19 utt2	A	did a lot of growing up.
	ba	20 utt1	B	I bet.

b	23 utt1	A	Yeah.
	b^m	24 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	25 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	26 utt1	B	He came from a poor immigrant family,

^2	27 utt1	A	Do it himself.
	sd	28 utt2	B	and he did.

sd	31 utt1	A	You know, I had wanderlust, you know.
	b	32 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	33 utt3	A	So I started to work on my education.
	b^r	34 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	35 utt1	A	Course my job was such that I couldn't do it as much as I wanted
	b	36 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	37 utt1	A	and still I ended up going two semesters when I got out just to get my degree.
	ba	38 utt1	B	That's pretty good.

sd	39 utt1	A	But, I've been in school ever since .
	ba	40 utt1	B	That's good.

sv	41 utt2	A	I guess.
	b	42 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	43 utt2	A	I mean if you don't like,
	sd	44 utt1	B	I mean, working in the national parks, working, clean up the roadsides

ba	47 utt1	A	Exactly.
	sv	48 utt1	B	I mean, I've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend * why no slash? not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job, but at least some of their time to go out and clean up the roads. You know,

sv	53 utt2	A	and if they're able bodied people, I don't see any problem at all with having them go out there and, if nothing else, get a group of them together and take them around to old folks places and let them cut the yards, paint the houses.
	b	54 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	59 utt2	A	get something out of that money.
	sv	60 utt1	B	Country would benefit,

sd	63 utt4	A	and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able bodied
	bh	64 utt1	B	That right.

sd	65 utt4	A	and, back in those days they also use to give you, booklets good for, clothing and gas, and things like this .
	b	66 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	67 utt1	A	They get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games you know,
	b^r	68 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	69 utt2	A	and I jus , I have a hard time dealing with that.
	sd	70 utt1	B	What I hear one time, I think it was on Paul Harvey's, radio segment, that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy, each person would receive like forty five thousand dollars.

b	71 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	72 utt1	B	I mean, I was astounded.

sd	73 utt3	A	you, you think about, you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient,
	b	74 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	75 utt1	A	and there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy.
	aa	76 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	77 utt4	A	and, quite honestly I just got so fed up with it I just couldn't stand it any more.
	bh	78 utt1	B	Is that right,

sd^e	79 utt2	A	I mean, this is the kind of thing you look at.
	b	80 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	81 utt5	A	Well just ridiculous.
	b	82 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	83 utt1	A	This is ridiculous.
	sv	84 utt1	B	It's sad.

sv	85 utt6	A	I mean, these these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks.
	b	86 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	89 utt2	A	and I would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance.
	b	90 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	91 utt1	A	Give an incentive.
	^2	92 utt1	B	Educational or vocational training or something.

sd	93 utt2	A	Something that's going to help them along the way.
	sv	94 utt1	B	And they'll help the country eventually, too, because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people,

ad	97 utt2	A	I mean I mean, look at the statistics,
	sv	98 utt1	B	and that's only going to help.

sd	99 utt3	A	One in five Americans can't read
	b	100 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	101 utt2	A	and we've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math.
	b^r	102 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	103 utt2	A	We're becoming a service country.
	bf	104 utt1	B	As opposed to what we were twenty years ago.

sv	105 utt5	A	and they did it better than we do.
	b	106 utt1	B	Yeah

sd	107 utt1	A	Simple as that.
	sv	108 utt1	B	because they have the ambition, I guess.

sd	109 utt2	A	simple as that.
	b	110 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	111 utt2	A	it's terrible for us.
	sv	112 utt1	B	I think that if, young people had service to the country might give them more ambition. Because they learn that serving other people is a good thing.

sv	115 utt2	A	and it can be good for them, too.
	b	116 utt1	B	Yeah,

aa^r	121 utt1	A	I know.
	ad	122 utt1	B	Give me the money

sv	123 utt1	A	Well, you know, you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house.
	b	124 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	125 utt3	A	Parents aren't parents any more.
	aa	126 utt1	B	No.

sd	127 utt2	A	One of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble?
	b	128 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	129 utt1	A	Well, as a substitute teacher for a year, I can say yes.
	b	130 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	133 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd(^q)	134 utt1	B	And when come time to get out of school, I thought, Boy, I'd like to teach.

b	135 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	136 utt1	B	You know, I don't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life.

aa	137 utt1	A	Exactly.
	sv	138 utt1	B	I mean, that's a sad thing to think,

sv	139 utt2	A	but you have to look out for yourself you know,
	aa	140 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	141 utt3	A	and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers,
	sv	142 utt1	B	That's wrong.

fe	143 utt2	A	gosh,
	sd	144 utt1	B	I'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less,

sd	145 utt4	A	I mean, I have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that.
	b	146 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	147 utt1	A	But, I mean, there's a sense of priorities here, too.
	b^r	148 utt1	B	Yeah.

qh	149 utt2	A	what's more important, picking up the garbage or educating our kids.
	b	150 utt1	B	Yeah

aa	151 utt3	A	sure.
	sd	152 utt1	B	But, you know, when it gets right down to it,

ad	153 utt2	A	I mean, on the other hand, I mean, you take a garbage man in New York City starts out at twenty six thousand dollars.
	ba	154 utt1	B	That's pretty good.

sd	155 utt1	A	Well I bet you there's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year.
	b	156 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	157 utt1	A	I mean, my other pet peeve is unions.
	aa	158 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	159 utt2	A	There was a time when unions were needed.
	^2	160 utt1	B	And they served a good function.

sv	161 utt3	A	and they're only there to perpetuate their own power structure.
	sd	162 utt1	B	I remember, the company my dad worked for, the people there went on strike against the management.

b	163 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	164 utt1	B	and they all lost their jobs.

sv	165 utt2	A	and and that's really what happened to the steel industry in this country.
	b	168 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	169 utt2	A	And, well, that took care of that industry
	aa	170 utt1	B	That's right.

sv	171 utt2	A	Detroit worked awfully hard on stopping car manufacturing in this country.
	sv	172 utt1	B	And they're trying to do that now with the imports.

sv	173 utt3	A	and I don't think we ever will.
	sv	174 utt1	B	It'll be a tough road, though.

sv	175 utt3	A	and we've got to go into partnership with the Japanese to build cars.
	b	176 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	177 utt1	A	You know . And they only did it because I guess they were embarrassed that they're so good at it .
	b	178 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	181 utt6	A	I don't care what kind it is.
	sv	182 utt1	B	It teaches them pride in their country.

sv	183 utt2	A	and pride in themselves, too.
	aa	184 utt1	B	That's right.

sv	185 utt1	A	they could, I mean, you could organize something just within your community. same old thing.
	b	186 utt1	B	Yeah,

aa	189 utt2	A	Uh huh.
	sv	190 utt1	B	And that's a great idea.

sv	1 utt4	A	and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have.
	b	2 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qo	3 utt2	A	How about you?
	h	4 utt1	B	well, I don't actually live in the city,

sv	5 utt2	A	probably right, if you look at it from that stand point.
	b	6 utt1	B	Uh huh.

qy	7 utt2	A	is there anything, that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing?
	sd	8 utt1	B	where I live now it's not so bad.

qr	9 utt2	A	Do you live in a real small town or out in the country?
	sd	10 utt1	B	I live out in the country,

qw	11 utt1	A	How far out from the city, I mean, do you,
	sd	12 utt1	B	I'm about fifteen miles out.

sd	13 utt2	A	I live in a little suburb, which I guess from Dallas is twelve miles or so
	b	14 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	19 utt1	A	Our major crimes in our immediate town, is probably house robberies and very few instances of, you know, alcohol, drugs, reported.
	b	20 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	21 utt2	A	However, I'm sure they're there.
	b	22 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	23 utt1	A	But, right now our neighborhood is running about, eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed, sometime during their, existence in that neighborhood.
	ba	24 utt1	B	Wow.

sd	27 utt1	A	And since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or, you know, burglar alarms and including the outer perimeter type, devices, sensors and things like that.
	b	28 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	31 utt4	A	so it still, remains city wide, pretty high.
	qy	32 utt1	B	are there any theories on why this is happening?

sv	33 utt1	A	I would say the majority of it's happening during the day, between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon.
	b	34 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	37 utt2	A	and both people are working.
	b	38 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	39 utt1	A	So they're happening during the hours they're gone from work.
	b	40 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	41 utt2	A	they'll stock your house and, look at your pattern and then go from there.
	qy^d	42 utt1	B	So they're professionals?

sd	45 utt1	A	you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier, just taking, you know, just junk items that they can just get, you know, ten to twenty bucks for real quick.
	b	46 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	47 utt2	A	the, you know, Mercedes, Volvos, things that they can get, you know, big dollars for and the jewelry are the major targets,
	b^r	48 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	51 utt1	A	Very few, you know, penny ante stuff.
	qw	52 utt1	B	Well, what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime?

sd	53 utt5	A	and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty, for that amount of people which is not very many.
	b	54 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	61 utt3	A	so they're giving the early release,
	b	62 utt1	B	Right.

sd	63 utt3	A	I think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences,
	qy	64 utt1	B	So you think that would be a deterrent?

na	65 utt1	A	That would certainly be a deterrent.
	b	66 utt1	B	Uh huh.

ad	67 utt2	A	You know, if they're overcrowded, just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate.
	qw	68 utt1	B	Well, what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty?

sv	69 utt2	A	Course, I know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof.
	b	70 utt1	B	Right.

aa	73 utt1	A	I'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence, to convict somebody
	b	74 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	75 utt2	A	and then those convicted, especially of, you know, murder and, you know, major crimes, to reach the life sentences and, you know, death penalties and follow through with that.
	b^r	76 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	79 utt1	A	especially, you know, in the case of murder
	b	80 utt1	B	Right.

sd	81 utt1	A	I know in my case, my wife and daughter were kidnapped, during a house robbery back in eighty five
	ba	82 utt1	B	wow.

sd	85 utt2	A	we, we went through the court system and all that sort of thing
	b	86 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	87 utt2	A	and, you know, two counts of kidnapping, you know, the forty five to the head, you know, just the mental anguish and the whole nine yards you know, the guy only got five years.
	b	88 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	93 utt1	A	And, you know, he was out within two months because of the parole system.
	qy	94 utt1	B	did you sue him under the civil system?

br	95 utt1	A	Do what now?
	qy^r	96 utt1	B	Did you sue him under the civil system?

sd^e	97 utt2	A	I'm not real familiar with that.
	sv	98 utt1	B	Well, you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something, right, and try to get money from him

^q	101 utt4	A	there's nothing that he has that you could go after.
	b	102 utt1	B	Yeah.

aa	103 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	104 utt1	B	But they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt.

sd	105 utt5	A	you or the insurance companies never see any of that money.
	b	106 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	107 utt2	A	they, been in jail before ,
	b	108 utt1	B	Uh huh,

sv	109 utt1	A	they've been released, you know, several times, which is another, deal I hate to see.
	b^r	110 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	113 utt1	A	But, you know, basically the guy commits, you know three major crimes and, and car theft on top of it, destroys my car,
	b	114 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	119 utt2	A	and, you know, the guy gets out in two months
	ba	120 utt1	B	That's awful .

sd	121 utt3	A	Fact, he's back in jail now.
	sv	122 utt1	B	Gives you sympathy for the vigilantes.

qh	123 utt2	A	what deterrent does he really have?
	b	124 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	125 utt2	A	I think in our particular neighborhood, vigilantism is becoming a real possibility.
	b	126 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	127 utt1	A	we've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually, you know, shot the people
	ba	128 utt1	B	my God.

sd	129 utt4	A	then other people will wait up, you know, and wait for somebody to do something else, try to take it in their own hands.
	b	130 utt1	B	Right.

sd	131 utt1	A	Course it doesn't always work out in their favor.
	b^r	132 utt1	B	Right.

sd(^q)	133 utt1	A	But, nevertheless, I think people are just getting fed up and saying, you know, you can't arrest all of us,
	b	134 utt1	B	Uh huh.

^q	135 utt2	A	you can, you know, you can get some of us,
	b	136 utt1	B	Right.

^q	137 utt2	A	you can't get all of us.
	b	138 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	139 utt1	A	and we're beginning to see more and more of that.
	sv	140 utt1	B	And that's a deterrent, too. If you think the home owner might be armed, right, and awake

b	141 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	142 utt1	B	here you break in,

sd	143 utt3	A	we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in, you know, during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death.
	b	144 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	145 utt1	A	And, it helps for a while
	b^r	146 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	149 utt1	A	I would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught, they're from places like up in Oklahoma, and Louisiana, Arkansas, you know, across the border.
	ba	150 utt1	B	Wow,

sd	151 utt1	A	So, you know, people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever
	b	152 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	153 utt1	A	it's not many from the local communities.
	b^r	154 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	155 utt2	A	and I just, I think that the court systems need to be more in, stiffer in their penalties,
	b	156 utt1	B	Yeah.

sv	157 utt2	A	and, and, giving the, police, agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they catch these people.
	b	158 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	161 utt1	A	Right.
	sv	162 utt2	B	And I think one of the big things that you can do to increase deterrence is, if someone is found guilty of a, felony level offense, they lose their citizenship.

b	163 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sv	164 utt2	B	and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about, you know, protecting these people from, we just don't protect them.

sd	165 utt1	A	I know like in my wife's case, they made her feel like the criminal.
	aa	166 utt1	B	I know,

qy	1 utt2	A	have you painted something lately?
	ny	2 utt1	B	Yes,

b	3 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	4 utt1	B	And then since then we have painted the bedroom.

qy^d	5 utt2	A	another bedroom.
	ny	6 utt1	B	Yeah,

ny^r	7 utt3	A	Yeah.
	bk^m	8 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	9 utt1	A	yeah
	b	10 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	11 utt2	A	Well, I painted the outside of my house and one bathroom.
	b	12 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	13 utt2	A	But I have that problem with the ceiling, you know, the blown, ceiling. You know where you get around the edge.
	b	14 utt1	B	yeah.

qw	21 utt1	A	Well, how do you get the edge though?
	br^m	22 utt1	B	How do you get the edge?

aa	23 utt1	A	the straight edge?
	sd	24 utt1	B	You just have to be real careful.

b	25 utt1	A	I see.
	sd	26 utt1	B	We use, a two inch brush on a slant

b^r	27 utt2	A	Uh huh.
	sd	28 utt1	B	and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes.

qy	29 utt1	A	Well are you going to paint the outside of your house too?
	ny	30 utt1	B	Well, yeah.

bh	31 utt1	A	really?
	ny	32 utt1	B	Yeah,

ba	33 utt1	A	nice.
	sd	34 utt2	B	There are three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses.

b	35 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	36 utt1	B	So, I am thinking I am going to change it to, something, you know,

b	37 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	o@	38 utt2	B	I think I am going to put something like a brown on it, on the outside. And maybe, a little deeper brown in the entry way or something so it will stand out a little. What color did you paint,

^2	43 utt1	A	or two tone. You know.
	b	44 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	47 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	qw	48 utt1	B	What color did you paint your house?

sd	49 utt1	A	White.
	bf	50 utt1	B	On the out,

sd	51 utt3	A	and we can't paint the chimney .
	ad	52 utt1	B	Well, you have got to get one of those ladders.

sd	53 utt2	A	We are just not willing to get up that high.
	b	54 utt1	B	yeah.

sd	57 utt5	A	but and the only thing I would consider a professional, maybe doing that,
	b	58 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	59 utt3	A	other than doing our own work I prefer it to a professional.
	sd	60 utt1	B	Well, our house in New Mexico, it was stucco,

b	61 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	62 utt1	B	And we did basically seventy five percent of the house

b	63 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	64 utt1	B	So, I hired this man to come in and do it. A young kid.

b^r	65 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	66 utt1	B	And he came with his own raf ,

qy^d	67 utt1	A	The blowers?
	nn	68 utt1	B	No,

sd	69 utt1	A	I know what you are talking about.
	b	70 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	71 utt2	A	That's it .
	sd	72 utt1	B	He came and did it that way

b	77 utt1	A	Yeah.
	sd	78 utt1	B	and if he fell, he was dead

sv	79 utt2	A	So that was worth it getting a professional for that.
	aa	80 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	83 utt2	A	but other than that, it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself.
	b	84 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	85 utt1	A	It wasn't too bad.
	qw	86 utt1	B	How much did it cost you for the paint for the outside?

sd	87 utt1	A	Shoot, maybe a hundred and fifty.
	bk	88 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	89 utt3	A	But then that way you know you are assured you did a good job than you are, you know, if you hire someone to do it.
	b	90 utt1	B	Yeah.

b	95 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	96 utt1	B	and yet he bought like seventeen gallons.

ba	97 utt1	A	My word.
	sd	98 utt1	B	And, anyway, when he checked out and he was using his charge card too. They only charged him for one gallon of paint. Like thirteen bucks or something.

ba	103 utt1	A	my word.
	sd	104 utt1	B	And he had, the, he had already carried a ladder outside and told her that

b	105 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	106 utt2	B	and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint

b^r	107 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	108 utt1	B	so she had to start all over again

b^r	109 utt1	A	Uh huh.
	sd	110 utt1	B	and when he got outside, he noticed his receipt was like thirteen ninety nine or something.

ba	111 utt1	A	my word.
	sd	112 utt1	B	And he saw .

bf	113 utt1	A	So that was really worth it. Painting his own house.
	aa	114 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	117 utt2	A	Well, he really saved in that way.
	b	118 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	119 utt4	A	I want to do it about the same color. And just be a little,
	sv	120 utt1	B	Rollers are so messy.

qy	1 utt1	A	are you on a regular exercise program right now?
	ny	2 utt1	B	Yes,

sd	5 utt1	A	well, I'm kind of off and on.
	b^m	6 utt1	B	Off and on

sd	7 utt1	A	Right now I'm kind of off.
	sd	8 utt2	B	I'd say more on than off .

qw	9 utt2	A	what type of exercise do you do?
	sd	10 utt1	B	I do walking on the treadmill,

qy^d	11 utt2	A	I guess you don't enjoy that very much.
	ng	12 utt1	B	not really.

qy	13 utt1	A	Do you find that, to be boring?
	ny	14 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	17 utt1	A	Well, I'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring.
	b	18 utt1	B	yeah.

qy^d	21 utt4	A	I don't know if you've seen those advertised on T V.
	ny	22 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	23 utt3	A	so it's collecting dust right now.
	b	24 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	25 utt1	A	I used to jog somewhat.
	sd	26 utt2	B	I use to have one,

sd	27 utt6	A	when I go visit them, I get on that thing every now and then.
	b	28 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	29 utt4	A	had to get out to do something.
	b	30 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	31 utt2	A	so thought I, better get outside and do something and not waist the day.
	b	32 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	35 utt5	A	and so I really don't ever keep a program up consistently.
	qy	36 utt1	B	Have you ever had any injuries from jogging?

sd	37 utt4	A	I usually only go about a mile or two.
	sd	38 utt1	B	I guess it worries me about jogging that I hear that it's very hard on your body and that, you know, you can end up getting hurt, worse.

sv	41 utt1	A	it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete, or on asphalt.
	b	42 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sv	43 utt2	A	Suppose to be much better if you find grass, or dirt to jog on.
	b	44 utt1	B	Yeah,

sv	47 utt2	A	that's, very important.
	b	48 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	53 utt3	A	my don't get very much use .
	sv	54 utt1	B	Well, I guess my breakdown they say about every six months.

sd	59 utt1	A	But, that gets old too in a very short order,
	b	60 utt1	B	Yeah.

sd	61 utt2	A	I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis.
	b	62 utt1	B	Yeah,

b	63 utt1	A	Yeah.
	b	64 utt1	B	well.

sd	65 utt1	A	Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can, start some type of, regular program.
	b	66 utt1	B	Yeah,

sd	67 utt1	A	I've always found that, when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep something going.
	b	68 utt1	B	Uh huh.

sd	69 utt2	A	an, one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine, lifting weights and, working out like that.
	b	70 utt1	B	Oh.

sd	71 utt3	A	we kept charts of our progress, and, consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks.
