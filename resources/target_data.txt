sd	and they just plan on being here.
b	Yeah,
sd	So it was good, it, it worked out very well.
sd	One interesting thing that they did at the time is they videotaped the whole shebang it made a nice remembrance of the entire party.
aa	Yeah,

sv	I'd say health care is way up there, especially anybody with kids.
sd	and does the company pay for it. You know, all or partially
sd	And, also, vacation time too is a big one for me. and I guess support for whatever other, you know, kinds of professional activities you have at, you know, work.
sd	cause I've been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer any and sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though,
sv	so that's not so bad, you know.
sv	You know, it's kind of a give and take kind of thing, I think.
sv	I say that health care is probably definitely number one though.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	cause that makes a big difference.
sd	And she works, as a assistant manager in a fabric store.
sd	And so she works a lot of evenings and weekends
aa	Yeah,
sd	And I think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too.
sd	I mean usually, you know, you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting, up for school
sd	And especially in the winter. I mean, you get up in the dark and come home in the dark you know.
b	Yeah.
sd	a lot of I guess is.
aa	Yeah.
sd	especially in large corporations. You can really, you know, wind up having, you know, real problems I've found out.
sd	I work with, computer systems a lot.
sv	It's real hard to rate something like that.
sd	It's like get a painter, you know, or something, a artist.
sv	Well, I think it's inevitable that we are going to see national health care
sv	Well, it's going to make it tough for them
sv	And, as a society we are paying a staggering price for this.

b	Yeah

b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Ready to go.
b	Right.
sd	I know it builds up really fast.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	and, so it really builds up with us.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	They used to have several places, that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all,
sd	and they stopped doing it because they said it wasn't profitable.
sd	So finally, the people put so much pressure on the city,
sd	they did a survey of everybody,
sd	and they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic, and put it in front of the Wal Mart store in town,
sd	and they, it just really,
sd	and so Wal Mart complained ,
sd	so they moved it behind the store
sd	and so people kept piling stuff in the same place, where it used to be.
sd	it was just like a dump there,
sd	and so finally, you know, I called
sd	So we do that because we have milk cartons, you know, constantly, with two little kids, and the paper,
sd	but it just builds up,
sd	it would be so nice if they had it, you know at your home, where you could just turn it in so they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area , in one neighborhood,
sd	and they have pickup there,
sd	And the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out
sd	but then finally people started getting the message.
aa	Yeah,
sv	I think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this,
sv	and it's not going to be,
sv	I don't think .
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I know this year we took our Christmas tree
sd	and they gave you a little, seedling to plant, you know ,
sd	you could take the mulch home with you, you know, and take buckets of that home,
sv	so that was really good idea,
sd	I thought.
b	Yeah
aa	yeah
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I've read so many different things about diapers
sd	but now their saying that they're, really not that much in comparison to the others because you don't have to use the water to wash them, and, you know, all different kinds of things too,
sd	so the diaper service, trucks
sd	So I don't know what's the, you know, right thing to do
sd	but the landfill have to do something special, you know, for those,
sd	but that just generates a tremendous of volume of trash too,
b	Yeah.
aa	It does,
sv	because you hate to contribute to the problem,
sv	but on the on the other hand the alternatives aren't to great either .
b	Yeah,
sd	I don't know if those are recyclable
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	we don't either,
sd	we usually use frozen vegetables and things
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	we try to recycle old clothes .
sd	Our church has a place, where you can take them
sd	and they, you know, pass them on to, other families,
b	Yeah,
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
bf@	Kind of like a Goodwill, / * should this really be the end of a slash unit? B's next utterance is left hanging as a result

b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I'm not sure I can't really think of anything else that we could recycle.
b	Yeah.
b	Okay.
fc	You to.
fc	Bye bye. .
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes,
sd	but I work at a manufacturing plant,
sd	But occasionally I have to get dressed up and wear panty hose and a dress, and high heel shoes
sd	and I feel really uncomfortable doing that
sd	But, normally I just wear blue jeans and a T shirt.
sd	Very, very, comfortable.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Right .
sd	Well, I have plenty of suits and dress clothes because I'm like you, when I first started working, I have all these suits and blouses and skirts and mix and match, and that kind of stuff ,
sd	but now that I, you know, work in the manufacturing plant, then it's just, so much more difficult for me to actually get dressed up to come in to work like that.
sd	but occasionally I have to because, part of my job is teaching, and training,
sd	and, so you have to look just a little bit nicer than your normal, garb .
sd^r	Than your normal garb .
sd	and I had mostly polyesters and, wools and winter clothes and buying all these cotton clothes,
sd	and then, of course, you have to iron them all the time.
sd	that's been a problem for me.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's true, that's true.
sd	Well, I know, I was just now, putting away a lot of my winter clothes,
sd	and I was going through here
sd	And, because it's a wool skirt
sd	And I have five or six wool skirts,
sd	so I was thinking well, maybe, you know, I need to think about getting rid of them,
aa	Uh huh,
aa,o@	I know, I agree with you . / * 2 slash units?
sd	But the previous winter we had more, cold weather where I was able to actually wear, your double and triple layerings of, clothes yeah, like you would when you're up north.
sv	So , that's really interesting.
aa	Yes,
aa	Yes,
sd	It is, it is.
aa	That's true,
sd	and then you can actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall, you know, to have it, permanently attached,
sd	and that's what I'm thinking I'm going to have to do because mine's sitting right out in front of my bedroom
aa	Uh uh,
o	No.
sd	and I wouldn't have to have that eyesore .
b	Yeah.
sd	So, I have a big closet.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I'm like you, the night before or that day, I will iron whatever it is that we need
sd	and that's it.
sd	Because it's too many,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	No,
aa	Absolutely not .
aa	Uh huh,
aa	That's right .
sd	I know several of my girlfriends, though, we all keep our ironing boards out and just, an ever present thing in our household
ba	There you go.

sd	This isn't a good topic for me right now.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Well I don't know how much publicity it's gotten outside of the state
sd	to be honest, I didn't pay that much attention, to the details of it.
sd	the big disagreement I have is that in California, the appeals process, is so extensive and takes so long that you end up spending a huge amount of money in like ten to fifteen years before you can actually, you know, put somebody to death for, for a crime.
sv	And, I mean, that's ridiculous.
sv	and you should be able to either put the guy to death
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
sd	and so he wasn't, you know, mentally competent or anything else. Which is ridiculous,
sd	and the court found him competent,
sd	I forget.
sv	it was something really outrageous.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think in general, punishment in the United States is a lot weaker than it should be.
sv	I mean there's no connection between the two.
sd	I mean you take you know, most of the people who are committing violent crimes, most of them, not all by any means,
sv	they don't really see past next week much less next year.
sd(^q)	And to say, you know, well if I kill somebody then a decade from now, I might face the punishment.
sv	That's not real.
b	Uh huh.
qy	you mean, would he be put to death for that?
sd	largely depends on the circumstances
sd	if they can say things like, you know, well he was just, you know, temporarily insane because of, some domestic squabble then you know, they'll give him, you know, twenty years with parole in twelve or something like that .
sd	that's, that's the state that was famous when they executed somebody.
b^m	Gary Gilmore.
sd	By firing squad, as I recall.
b	Uh huh
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	until recently I've been sort of,
sd	I assume they're doing it for that reason .
sv(^q)	by by saying well, doing th , this particular crime in this particular way is a capital crime now.
b	Uh huh.
aap	Not often.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it seems like it's gotten carried away,
o	No,
qy	yeah, I mean, doesn't this encourage murder, in order to wipe out the the witnesses?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	I see,
sd	A six person jury could have decided either way, of course .
b	Uh huh.
sv^r	The problem there is that they've been let out jail.
b	Yeah,
ny	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I'm in Richardson.
ny	Yeah,
sd	And they also have a couple of areas where you can take, cans, plastic and paper, to, you know, dump them off there if you don't, want to wait and have a pick up, least of paper,
no	I'm not sure.
qo	What about you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
qw	Where do you take them?
b	Uh huh.
sd	One of the people from my department, I think used to take a lot of the stuff to a recycling center that was for the benefit of the Dallas Shelter.
sd	she's not here anymore
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, sometimes we always keep our aluminum cans.
sd	And a lot of times they take them over to one of these can banks.
sd	You don't get too much money back.
sd	But normally I collect, like three trash bags full
sd	and I take them over to that can bank
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and like sometimes they come by,
sd	I'm not really sure why they're not always consistent in that.
sd	That would be easy.
sd	You're not supposed to have, like the coupons in there.
sd	or you're not supposed to put magazines in there
sd	and you can't take newspapers.
ny	Yeah,
sv	You know, well, that's stupid
sd	There was like a lot of paper coming out of our department that wasn't recyclable.
sd	So I thought that was pretty good to expand upon it,
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
sd	Well, we had the one person who used to take things to the Dallas Shelter.
sd	I think that's what that was called.
sd	she used to collect from the whole department,
sd	I wish I could remember the whole name of that place,
sd	she used to collect them from everybody in the department.
sd	She'd go up and down with her little bag collecting from everybody.
sd	Well, I, don't seem to have as much spare time as I used to,
sd	Well, I sit and design cards

sd	so I get it from T V a lot.
sd	And, The thing about it, you know, now that I've found, is that we get such good coverage on T V, or at least such, I don't know, attempted thoroughness of coverage, by the time you get the TIME MAGAZINE, there's nothing in it you don't know.
na	Right.
sv	You know, it's, basically you've heard everything
sv	and, you might get a little more thorough, account of something,
h	I would say.
b	Right
sv	I think our concept of news isn't necessarily events that happen.
sv	But, on, on T V I think, they try to throw in good stuff,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	I mean, you know, I remember, well, just the things that are covered.
sd	I mean, you know, that was just so phenomenal to see this stadium shake and the announcers, you know grabbing,
sd	I mean, it's like, that was just something because that was like live and real like you said,
sv	and then, of course, one thing I think, too, is with tele ,
sd	A Ford Explorer.
sd^r	A Ford Explorer.
ny	Yeah,
sd	And, I'd probably buy another, this is the first American vehicle I've owned.
sd	So I would probably purchase another one, I would be more selective in the dealership that I purchased it from
nn	No,
qw	And why would that be?
qw	What's wrong with the Volvo.
b	Oh.
qw	what city are you calling from?
b	Oh.
sd	Up in Dallas.
b^m	B M W or Mercedes, yeah,
b	Uh huh.
qw	What do you presently drive?
ba	fun.
sv	Well there nothing wrong with those, they're nice veh , they're nice vehicles, nothing wrong with those.
sd	it's just everybody has their own taste,
br	Huh?
bd	no,
b	Yeah,
sd	they're kind of low to the ground after driving the Explorer.
sd	Because you can't see a car ahead of you,
qo	what are your feelings about American versus European cars?
qw	Why not.
ba	That's the way it goes, I guess.
ny	Yeah,
sd	I don't know, I mean, I think European cars are great, course you've got to have metric wrenches and stuff
sd	excellent warranty, I mean, just, unbelievable warranty.
sd	I wouldn't send my dog to buy a car from Middlekauff Ford.
sd^r	Middlekauff Ford in Plano.
sd	their attitude is just slimy.
qy	Middlekauff wouldn't?
sd^t	I was asking you some questions about the telephone and how many have you been doing,
sd^t	they don't want to hear that.
qy^t	Is that all?
ba	Good Lord,
fe	God, I've,
sd^t	That's why I wasn't sure if this was the second time around or what.
ad	And keep smiling.
fc	Bye, bye.
b	All right,
ny	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I certainly am too.
aa	Yes, sir.
b	Oh.
sv	Well, it just, it's so discouraging that they can't really,
sv	We certainly need to support them,
qy	Do you go to the game?
aa	Yes,
sv	But, maybe they can do some.
aa	Yes, sir,
ba	Yes, sir.
sv	And they have just done as much as they can for that man,
aa	I do, too.
sv	I mean, you can't give, anyone too many chances
sv	and I think he has gone over the limit.
aa	That's right.
aa	It is tragic.
ba	Yes, sir.
aa	I think you're right.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
nn	No
sd	And I'd go up there with friends after school a couple of times every week
sd	and then I'd started picking it up again a couple of years back
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I mean it's a great game
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
na	a little bit but not a whole lot.
sd	well they range anywhere from about five bucks for your basic city type course up to fifty, sixty dollars for a really, really nice course.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
sd	Somebody's paying
aa	Yeah
aa	Yeah,
sv	It's nice to see those , guys.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I was able to go and see one of the rounds of that
sd	I never really thought it would be that much fun to go to a big golf tournament and watch
aa	Right.
sd	I mean it's a lot more exciting than actually watching it on T V.
sd	and then they go off to some other hole
sd	I'm a student right now.
ny	Yeah.
sd	At, Indiana University.
sd	I don't really know.
nn	No .
b	Yeah.
b	Huh.
bh	yeah?
sv	Well, you know, it seems like, well you go to work every weekend. Play, maybe, one, two tournaments a month. You come in about tenth, you'd still be doing pretty well.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right .
sv	that is out of control.
b	Yeah
b	Yeah.
bk	Okay,
sd	Well, I'm in Dallas right now,
sd	well, I don't know if you know,
sd	So we're trying to promote that, because she thought we just put them in a special trash can and threw them away,
bk	okay.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	it's just different kinds of plastics, like the clear plastic is different from that milky looking plastic.
sd	And that's what the different types are.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	I know there's a long scientific name
sd	I don't know if they do it all over,
sv	That's something since we all seem to have an abundance of those plastic grocery bags .
sv	I know we use them for trash can liners and a lot of other things.
aa	Yeah,
sd	The only problem with those is sometimes they get holes in the bottom.
sd(^q)	It's like, whoops, there goes my chips
^q	okay,
qy	in fact did you happen to see TWENTY TWENTY the other night?
sd	They did a program,
sd	They have built up one mountain.
sd	They built up one mountain, covered it with grass, and put ski lifts on it,
sd	it's, Riverview, Ohio or some place up there.
sd	But I thought it was a pretty neat idea.
aa	Yeah,
sd	So, they're going to be called the Twin Peaks.
sd(^q)	So, it's like, well, no, Honey.
^q	and you make them into new things,
qy	so do you all go ahead,
aa	Well, yeah,
sd(^q)	Was like, well, from trees That's why you have to cut down trees and why you have to plant more trees.
aa	Yeah,
sd	But at least she knows that that is something that people need to be doing,
aa	Right.
sd	I'm in the legal department
sd	And I don't know too much about the air pollution thing.
sd	And supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants from what I've heard, that everything would be in, you know, confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up.
bk	okay.
b	Oh .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Now is that place built
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	Well, I know from some of the sites that we've had, quite a list of cites that have gone bad
b	Yeah.
sd	there was one site that they cleaned up
sd	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bh	you were?
bk	okay.
aa	Yes.
sd(^q)	People used to come and laugh and go, gee, I hadn't seen one of those ten, fifteen years.
sd	We, finally got a little respect.
aa	Right.
fc	You too.
fc	Bye.
aa	Right.
nn	No,
b	Yeah.
sd	but grew up in, Iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of lawn and garden work.
aa	Yeah.
bd	No.
sd	So, not growing up familiar with here, when I get a chance I listen to that Neil Sperry and do that .
b	Yeah.
bh	Yeah?
sd	Don't do any, any gardening in the sense of, vegetable gardening
sd	There was one when, we, when we bought the house
qo	What about you?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	Well, good.
b	Yeah.
nn	No.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
qw	What, Well, what kind what kind of trees are they?
b	Huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	but what trees were there when we moved in, had been put in by the developer when he built the house,
sd	And, figured up last night,
sd	three we've lost to, to, freezes between, eighty three and then, a year ago we lost, another one.
b	Yeah,
sd	two of them, the wind blew over in terms of getting them down.
b	Yeah.
sd	but what I just used a hand saw and sawed them off at, as close, close to ground level as I could, and then, got s , got some chemical that drill holes and pour in that helps , helps rot the,
b^m	stump ki , yeah, stump killer, and stump rotter,
sd	But, this last one had a fair sized root
b	yeah,
sd	and, I took the,
sd	and, and it's filling in with grass, nicely this year, so that, that was worth it
aa	Yeah.
aa	Yeah
b	Yeah.
aa	yeah.
b	But, yeah,
sd	And I took it back home,
sd	But, o , one of my sons and a couple of his friends this year have ,
b	Really.
sd	Well, I haven't been in probably about three years.
sd	And the last time we went was in, well, I guess it was like hunting season,
sd	It is real pretty.
qy	Do you do a lot of fishing?
sd	One of the ones that you pull along
qy	and is it pop up?
b^r	Pop up.
ny	Yeah.
br^m	A tent?
b	Really.
bf	So you're a serious camper.
ba	Well, that makes sense.
qy	But when you all went camping is that what you normally, I mean,
sv	I guess probably just wherever you live at has a lot to do with what you're going to do when you go,
qy	Did you ever like travel around to what's that, the little K O A camps whenever
qy	ever done that?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bf	That actually travel, what, city to city, state to state.
sd	That's probably where I first started, was in Girl Scouts.
ny	Yeah
sd	well, let's see. I mean, I just like to go
sd	and we just kind of go and hang out and just do fun stuff.
sd	Roast marshmallows.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sv	kind of makes you appreciate a lot of the things you take for granted.
sd	Running water
sd	your hair dryer
sd	curling iron.
qo	What about your family.
ba	Hey,
b	Yeah,
sd	I don't know if I'll ever want another new car again, you know.
aap	Maybe not.
b	yeah,
sd	that's not quite authentic,
sd	I had to stop there.
b	Yeah,
sd	they just weren't really expensive,
aa	and, yeah, you know,
aa	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^m	You're an American car person.
b	Yeah,
h	and, I don't know,
^q	we'll try something different
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
sd	I'd, I would hate to see the American car industry suffering more than it already has you know, even though right now I'm not driving an American car,
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	and it final just wore out
ar	No,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	they've scaled everything down so much
b	Yeah,
sv	now the Lexus are very nice looking cars, you know.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's true,
b	Yeah.
bf	What is what,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
aa	Yeah.
sd	I guess it just, seems to me they're all the same shape.
b	Really.
qy	Are they still,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Now when was this,
bk	okay,
b	Yeah,
bk	I see.
b	Yeah.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my word.
ba	That's wild, you know,
sd	you hear about things like that
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	somebody's finally woken up, you know.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	yeah,
sv	and you really would have to be a dream car because the repair bills are supposedly just constant, you know.
b	Yeah,
sv	Well, that's good that you can.
b	really,
sv	I think it takes a talent to do that, you know,
sd	He drives, drives a Honda.
b	Uh huh,
b	Right.
sv	Well, that's one thing that when you would consider,
sv	so, you're pretty lucky in that respect
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and it's, it's really been so interesting the people you meet because, my husband Carl has called all over the country, you know,
sd	he's gotten these catalogs try ,
sd	well, we only have one child right now and another one on the way
sd	Latter Day Saints.
sd	So so that's what I would try to do.
ny	Uh huh,
aa	Right.
aa	Yeah.
nn	No,
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd,o@	I like that situation, that's usually real good . / * 2 slash units?
b	Uh huh.
bf	Have structured, activities and not just, you know, stick them in a corner and say you're on your own.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's true.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sv	That's, kind of a minimum there that you're getting.
sd	I like that term .
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's good.
aa	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
sv	Well, even educated play, supervised play, can teach without,
aa	yeah,
aa	Right,
aa	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
nn	No,
sd	Well, we decided to,
b	Right.
ny	Yes,
sd	But I've gotten rid of all of the credit cards, you know, that I possibly could,
sd	credit cards run, what, anywhere from, up to eighteen, nineteen percent, I guess.
sv	It's just a bad deal.
b	Uh huh,
aa	Absolutely.
sv	It's so easy to pull out the plastic,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	But, you know, the instant thing may, may be the way of the future you know, to replace checks and every other thing.
b	Yeah.
aa	It certainly does.
aa	Absolutely.
bk	I see.
bk	I see,
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
sd	But, I have in times past gotten into a bit of trouble with credit cards.
aa	That's right.
sv	Well, that's a novel idea.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	we plan purchases, you know, pretty well, you know, watch for the best buys, things like that.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Sure.
by	I'm sorry.
fc	Take care.
fc	Bye bye.
qy	Do you get a chance to do it at home
ba	I understand that.
sd	and then during the week, I catch up, you know, on the radio on the way to work or if I'm traveling around at lunch or on the way home
aa	No .
b	Yeah
aa	It is.
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see.
sd	it's frustrating to me because I don't know, what do I want to say? I wish that I was around more news.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
aa	That's true,
ba	oh no .
sd	A little bit that worries me, because I feel like the news is so biased.
sd	And yes,
sd(^q)	and I'm like, who are you to judge. You know,
^q	just report the facts.
b	Yes.
sv	And I feel like they sensationalize things that shouldn't be sensationalized.
sd	But they keep asking these questions
sv	Stupid.
aa	Uh huh,
aa	I agree.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	So I guess when I get to listen to the news, it's probably television or radio.
b	Yeah.
aa	Exactly,
sd	Well I'm glad tha ,
sd(^q)	and I'm like, how do they seem so together all the time.
sd	So, I guess news is just part of that rat race for me.
b	Yeah.
aa	Exactly.
b	Yeah,
fc	Well I appreciate talking to you.
fc	Have a good evening.
fc	Bye bye.
ny	Yes,
sd	maybe I'm a hard liner
na	Right.
sd	again, having participated in jury duty myself, I know , I know how such a diverse group of people get together, the different backgrounds, different ideas, that sometimes you can have one person or two, that can hold up what I consider the proper sentencing, of the person.
aa	Yes ma'am.
bd	No problem.
ny	Yes.
b	Yeah.
sv	So many things in their back,
aa	Yes.
sd	And yet, the attorney, for the prosecution could not enter the good man's background into it.
sv	Whereas, I think that's,
sv	Those that should be in jail should be in jail .
b	Yeah
sv	Well, I think this is one of the reasons that also that attorneys have such a, unsavory reputation,
b	Yeah
sv	And, that's not the idea.
b	Yeah
sd	And the person that killed him was a young woman who had left the house with full intent to commit crimes, carrying a gun in her purse.
sd	And, anyway it'd get to the,
sd	Of course it took eighteen months for the trial to happen.
sd	So, then, there was a letter writing campaign that went in,
b	Right.
sv	This is it
sv	and most people don't take the time.
sd	Again the only reason I took the time is because I was personally acquainted with these people.
sd	I'm just as guilty as the rest in that respect.
aa	yes.
b	Yeah
b	Okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	And then the amazing thing, of course, is how, some cases can come to trial in thirty days,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	I think, I think I have similar views,
sd	and she said that you know, they have to go through, they have to pat the kids down, because they bring guns to school.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
sd	my wife teaches, middle school.
ny	Yeah,
aa	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	she's, yeah, she can tell, she can tell, you know, when they have kids come in for,
sd	they meet with all of the parents,
sd	and she can tell before a parent comes in, normally, you know, give or take, eighty, ninety, per cent, you know, what the parents are going to be like when they come in, and the responses the parents will give back.
ny	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	I think it's probably very true.
b	Uh huh.
^q	let's sit down and read together.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	But you know what's really funny is that there's been some research, because I'm a, I'm a college professor, and, and, a lot of the research shows that like, Georgetown, while Hewing was playing at Georgetown, basketball, Georgetown, and they were winning, endowment to the university, in other words, money that could to everything, everything, and normally gets directed away from sports, realistically, a lot of the, was, was probably, two thirds, I guess it's now two thirds of what it was when they were national champions.
sd	In other words, while they're national champions, people donate more money.
sd	Average human beings like you and I, average Joes, that make a decent salary, that are a graduate of the school, send big bucks, like couple hundreds of dollars,
sd	but thousands of people,
ar	Because, no,
aa	Right,
sd	Because when Georgetown was number one, their, their money that was donated to them from companies, from l , from business people, from graduates, whatever, was up into, you know, like twenty million dollars,
sd	and now it's down to like, fourteen million.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
qy^d	but, smaller schools aren't like that,
qy^d	only the big time schools show that.
sv	But you're right,
sv	but swimming never gets much glory, so it really doesn't matter.
aa	That's true,
b^m	He didn't make it,
sd	I would have liked it if he would have, though,
sd	but I think, realistically you know, you read the, the research studies,
sv	and, I don't think he would have made it simply because the event he was trying to swim, the research shows that distance running, so I would assume distance swimming might be similar, that,
sv	and he was good at distance, Spitz, as a swimmer, you know,
sd	and, but he's was trying to make it in the sprinter's event,
sd	and most of them, are under twenty five.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
ba	you're kidding.
ba	Jeez.
b	Huh.
sd	as an athlete, I just hate that.
b	yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and something you have to consider, too, because I know as a, as a former high school teacher, I know that from right now,
fp	Hello .
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Where are you?
sd	In Garland, right outside of Dallas.
sd	So, we're getting a large ,
sd	Cambodians, Asians, Vietnamese.
aa	Yes,
t3	Okay.
^2	To get them on their,
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
sd	And there's a lot of graft, like people giving them information that was free to them anyway if they just knew how to get it.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
qy	You mean, really trying to plant something?
qy	Farming?
b	Oh.
ba	that's terrible.
b	Uh huh.
bf	And not being cared for.
bk	All right.
b	Uh huh
sd	Well, I'm an E S L teacher.
ny	Yes.
sd	I got my certification.
sd	I mean, it's like people don't know, what they say,
sd	it's not step for step.
b	Yeah
sd	But anyway, I enjoy it.
sd	but I'm applying for,
sv	A lot of our words are the same,
sv	like, you know, they just change the pronunciation a little bit.
sd	But, I love it.
sd	and I like it.
sd	And trying to get them set up, inculturated, into the system.
sd	I thought that would be good experience for me.
sd	And, I've applied at another district where many of the children are Asian.
sd	And I think that would be wonderful too.
b	Right.
sv	Well, the times were different too.
sd	My neighbor, let's see, is Jewish.
sd	And he spends,
sd	And he thoroughly enjoyed it.
aa	No.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And because they're so deficient in English, they haven't been able to get jobs.
sd	So they'll have to go back and get a degree here. You know, almost start all over.
aa	No,
sd	I feel sorry for her.
fc	Have a good night.
aa	Okay.
fc	Okay,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	I would think so.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and so she was always home for us
sd	and I always, really appreciated that. Having her there you know, when I came home from school and when I worked,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	They really do.
sv	a family without a father, it's, a really hard thing.
b	Uh huh.
ny	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And, Then we will try.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Well, We really want to have a family.
sv	give them an edge,
sd	But then, a family is definitely a high priority.
sd	Well, well I am in, I am in a different situation.
sd	and I am home on furlough.
sd	And then we go back for four years.
sd	So, we will share the job of raising the family.
sd(^q)	then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard about schooling, like do you want to home school your kids on a computer program you know, that kind of thing
^q	or do you send them away to boarding school
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's good.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, I'm just recently married.
sd	So I don't have any children. Though we plan on having them soon
sv	but I think, that that's probably one of the biggest difficulties,
b	Yeah,
sd	and it's nice for me because, most of the time you have so much flexible hours so that I could probably work two or three days a week, and then one or two evenings, so that if my wife does go back to work part time, there probably will be a possibility that I could stay home two days that she would go to work and that I would have to teach at night.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I think we're very lucky because just my job sort of builds in flexible schedules,
sd	I can even teach on Saturdays and, and things, like that.
b	Yeah,
sd	and one of the things they made in,
sd	my sister in law is a clinical speech pathologist,
sd	so, she is als ,
sd	it would be three years,
sd	so I guess she took off three all together
aa	Yeah,
sd	and she won't do it in the summer because her kids are home from school.
sd	So I don't know what they are going to do.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	so she was probably twenty seven when they were married,
sd	so she already had gotten bachelors and masters and established herself in a, profes , in a practice almost. where, you know, he then they waited a couple years
sd	and he got himself pretty far along, I guess they didn't have kids until he was about, twenty six
sv	but, I think the longer you wait the easier it is, if you have that professional occupation where you can change.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yep.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and sometimes they flunk kindergarten now.
sd	They don't let them into kindergarten unless they can count to ten and know their A B C s
sv	it's a very important part of your life
sd	you know, I can see that when you make that point.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yep.
sd	And I bet,
sv	I bet you could trace all the way back .
b	Yeah.
aa	That's true,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yep,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	because of having, you know, flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule.
sd	I teach a computer classes
sd	and I'm also, you know,
sd	and, you know, you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a Saturday, which means, that, you know, whole week's worth of courses
sd	so that lets you be available three days during the week, you know,
sd	so you be will home with your kids you know
sd	so, by the time he got home he was so tired
sd	and I think he missed a lot of, our up bringing.
sd	You know, my mother
sd,o@	it's funny I don't think she had to work until we started school I think teenagers become much more expensive . / * 2 slash units?
sv	It's probably costing you a fortune.
sd	My goodness, if you want them to be able to drive the car, the insurance bill.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
^2	Carpools,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd^r	it lasts a long time.
o@	Well, normally they come in, * slash error cause they'll come in in ten minutes normally and stop us. / * slash error
ng^t	Well, you don't have to
sd^t	you go the length
sd^t	Depends on how old the tapes are at that time.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	This is Baltimore, Maryland.
b	Yeah,
aa	Uh huh,
aa	Okay.
na	well, I sing.
sd	I don't play an instrument.
ng	not right now.
sd	pretty much anything.
ny	yeah.
sd	A long time out, all through college and everything I was in the choirs.
sd	And I've had some classical vocal training.
ny	Uh huh.
nn	No,
sd	in Germany.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Soprano.
sd	as far as opera goes, I'm, I think most fond of Verdi.
nn	No,
sd	but, that's, Puccini, I think,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa@	No. I think it would be nice if I played the piano.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah.
sd	I like to listen to all different kinds of music.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
sd	There's, you know, some of the really totally country stuff, I don't really particularly like
sd	Well, I have like, we,
sd	but I don't really know how to go about it without having a degree
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's good.
sd	I'm in Flower Mound.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
na	I'm married.
br	I'm sorry?
na	a little bit.
ny	Yeah,
sd	Probably .
fc	Okay.
fc	All right,
fc	Bye bye.
aa	I know.
sd	we do ours more monthly than long range.
sd	and when he gets paid, I pay all the bills.
sd	And out of his check they take a savings
sd	So, as far as extra savings, we really don't have that much extra to save.
sd	his check, once a month, pays all the bills.
sd	and it works out real well that way.
sv	but budgets are horrible.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
aa	I know.
sv	And, of course, the cost of living keeps going up so much.
sv	Groceries are outrageous
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well I know that since I do work, I buy a lot of quicker cuts of meat and, well the frozen things for the microwave and things like that.
sd	And I'll stop by the deli and pick up, chicken or whatever. Where if I did not work, I'm sure that the grocery bill could be managed a lot, better.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, I'm sure you do.
sd	But in the summer he's still young enough that I cannot leave him by himself.
sd	So in the summer I have that extra
sd	and that's usually movies one day, skating one day .
sd	Swimming one day .
aa	Yes.
sv	But you know, if they're going to be in daycare then they need to have some activities other than just being there.
qy	do you have two children?
sv	Well they're expensive too. just the outgrowing of their clothes
sv	so I'm sure the budget,
b	Yeah.
sd	Although the insurance we had was good, when Thomas was younger. A lot of the stuff had to be paid up front
aa	Yeah,
sd	I would too.
sv	Well, you probably wouldn't want to do it forever.
ny	Yes,
sd	but I had to replace it with something that the kids could carry.
b	Yes.
aa	Yes,
sd	so I called four or five dog trainers because I don't like the little dogs.
sd(^q)	and I asked them, you know, these are the ages of the kids, what do I get.
qy	Do you know what that is?
sv^m	They're cute.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, actually, you know, that's the breed standard for females.
ny	yeah,
sd	That is not breed standard.
sd	Fifty five is the minimum
sd	You cannot show your retriever if it's, you know, a hundred plus pounds.
ad	So don't say she's small, just say she's perfect.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yep.
sd	Well, they are the ultimate dog to have around kids so long as your kid is not scared of a big dog, because I had a retriever, actually I had a retriever Irish Setter cross. Which is a really nice animal
sd	and fortunately it was just like a retriever
sd	It was gorgeous.
sd	Since they've become so popular you get what I call backyard breeders. Which is probably where yours came from. People that don't know what they're doing, and they breed them, you know, for a certain characteristic.
sd	when I bought my last purebred retriever I mean I looked all over because I wanted one that still looked like a retriever, you know, the short to the ground, stocky, golden, trainable, tractable, quiet animal that could hunt and still be in the house.
sd	And I ended up getting one that, came out of a, a hunting stock because I wanted one that could still perform like a retriever did.
sd	And I've seen an awful lot of lately really dumb, dumb retrievers
sd	but I really figure right when it becomes really popular that it's going to be ruined.
aa	yeah.
sd	It was bred out of several different retrievers,
sd	But they selectively culled those litters, I mean, for many hundreds of years
sv	On the other hand, you know, they sure created a wonderful breed, I mean a wonderful breed.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I tell you, you know the German shepherd is the classic case of what I'm talking about because in America that's called a Rin Tin Tin phenomena.
sd	Only in America is there a dog called a German Shepherd.
sd	That dog is bred out of three European dogs. The Belgian Tervurien, a German Skutzhund, and a , I always forget the third one. I can see it.
sd	And there are distinct breeds in Europe.
sd	And everybody wanted Rin Tin Tin.
sd	That said anything that is a Skutzhund, a Tervurien and, that's the other one. Alsatian, any inner breeding of that can be called a German shepherd here.
sd	And what happened is, is that people wanted this shepherd to shepherd and protect.
sd	And even, police corps which started, you know, finding other breeds to use because this, this thing known as a German shepherd here, its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible.
sd	and it's the Alsatian that's the kid's dog.
sd	But you'll see,
sd	This is bred for,
sd	Because they were looking for this disposition.
ng	I used to,
sd	I sewed, you know, in high school
sd	And, my sister sewed
sd	and then just in the last, you know, ten or twe , I just haven't sewn anything.
b	Yeah.
sv	now it's a little more expensive to make it, because, you know, you start paying the price for the patterns and the material,
sv	but it's still such better quality that I think it's worth it.
bh	You're kidding me.
sd	See I can remember paying seventy five cents for a pattern .
b	Uh huh.
ba	Good night.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well and that always is helpful for starters.
sv	You know you have to have something that kind of gets you on the right track of where you're going.
aa	That's true.
qy	Well do you do anything el ,
sd	see, I've not ever been a real craft type person.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and I asked my roommate if she would teach me how to crochet granny squares.
sd	and I started crocheting a king size bedspread for a guy that I was dating at the time.
sd	And when we broke things off,
sd	One of these days I keep thinking I'm going to finish it because it would make a really pretty bedspread .
bf	Fast .
ng	I don't think so.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
bh	You're kidding,
sv	Well that takes all the work out of it.
ba	Well, how neat.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well that's neat.
b^m	For the machine,
b	Yeah.
bf	You have to learn how to do it.
qy^g	Otherwise, they hold it over your head forever, right .
^q	Now I bought you that machine .
qy	Do you paint or anything like that?
bf	Never.
sd	so do I.
sd	well I have one here,
sd	and my folks gave it to me,
sd	So, I'm not great,
b	Yeah.
aa	You do,
sd	Well, I figure it takes practice
sd	By the time I put my kids in bed at night, I don't want to do anything.
sd	you know, I've worked all day
sd	I don't want to do them sometimes,
sd	So, I try to save that for the weekend.
sd	Now the part about sewing that I never liked was laying out the material and the pattern and cutting it out.
sd	and my mom wanted some pants,
sd	But I hate laying out material and trying to get the most out of the material and, make sure it's on the right lines and not on the bias.
aa	Yes,
b	Yeah.
qw	Well what are some of the other features on this machine?
bk	okay.
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
bf	So it has the ability to do just about any type of sewing you want to do.
b	Uh huh.
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well I'm going to have to go check it out.
sd	boy, this is going to be tough, I'm in Plano .
aa	Exactly.
qw	what part of Dallas are you from?
b^m	north Dallas.
ba	Well, jeez.
qy^d	Well then you've been getting quite a bit of rain also.
bh	How about that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
bh	How about that.
ba	That's great.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Huh.
b^m	A hundred and sixty.
b	Uh huh,
b	Sure.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	True.
sd	Colorado.
aa	sure, I'm I'm very familiar,
sd	So, I'm, quite familiar with how it is up there,
sd	And it's always snow, you know,
aa	yes.
b	Uh huh.
aa	sure.
sd	So it's pretty amazing, it can be that drastic in just a short distance .
na	it's getting to be more and more of a possibility.
sd	It used to be no problem, just because it was such a rugged terrain and with trees everywhere,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Sure,
fc	Good bye .
fc^r	Good bye.
am	could be.
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I came from a smaller town in New York
sd	and the city was fairly big size or not real big
sd	every night the news is very depressing because they run down the list of how many people were shot, you know, drive by shootings or whatever
sd	and it, it's pretty bad.
sd	Well that seems to be what they were doing
sd	but, you know, it's very difficult.
sv	and you know, the more, less that's done about it the more it seems it tends to spread into smaller areas unfortunately.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
h	But I don't know.
sv	But it seems, I mean,
sv	and you know, something has to be done but just that too many people argue about how to fix it.
aa	sure.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sv	And that's just ridiculous
b	Right,
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Oh.
sd	Well, it's kind of a mixed breed that we got from the Humane Society .
ba	my.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, my children are the ones that wanted our pet,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's hard to do that when you're not there constantly,
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
sd	About the only time we have,
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ba	What a cute idea.
sd	Well, we got one one year for Christmas,
sd	and, so that one wasn't really well trained .
sd	I just didn't have time to take care of baby and train puppy at the same time,
aa	Yeah,
sd	and that was fun,
aa	That's right.
fp	Fine,
b	Yeah.
aa	Okay,
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Because they just say there's either no room in the system, you know, in the jails for them
sv	You know, it's crazy.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well even if it's life, like you say, we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some, you know, joker in there for life.
sv	So to me if somebody has life, you know, beyond a reasonable doubt that should be it.
sv	You know particularly for some of these really, I mean,
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right,
b	Right.
sv	And the victims, you know, the family of these people that have been murdered, they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution.
aa	Right,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	I saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge, I believe from Florida,
sv	He'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he's got his peers or something,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
aa	No,
aa	yeah,
aa	Okay,
sd	I'm very much in favor of gun control.
ny	Yes
sd	I don't mind people owning guns,
b	Yes.
sd	I believe that's correct,
b	Uh huh.
sv	That would certainly help,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	Uh huh,
no	I'm not sure I have.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
ba	that's interesting.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
aa	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yep,
ba	that's interesting.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Absolutely.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yep.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Sure,
aa	Yeah,
aa	I promise.
b	Okay,
ny	Yes,
b	Yeah,
sd	I do not quite a lot,
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure,
b	Uh huh.
ba	That'd be neat.
fc	Okay.
fc	Okay.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	I like the, idea.
sd	Well, I like the idea of voluntary support.
sd	I mean they might be able to, say that anyone who does that, gets certain benefits that would not be available to someone who didn't do it.
sv	The idea itself of service is good
aa	Yeah.
sv	You know, if someone were studying something, take something obscure. Somebody was studying economics, the State Department could offer to send them to the Soviet Union for two years to teach them how to run their country.
qy^g	As an extreme example, right?
nd	Well, they're not.
sd	And it's sort of a topic of debate.
sd	And the people who are proconstitution oppose it on the grounds that the government shouldn't even have the right to enforce you to join the military unless the United States is actually under attack .
sv	So, mostly, it's just kind of one of those things that goes away.
sd^c	They've got a noisy line.
b	Yeah.
sd	eighteen.
b	Yeah.
co^c	Let me see if I can get on a cleaner line.
b	Yeah
o	All right.
sd	And, of course, this one the women would be equally grabbed
ad	So, if you're near that age or you know somebody who is you know, be aware of that.
b	Yeah.
bk	okay.
sd	You know, we only find out about that a year after the fact.
sd	So, it's another thing.
sv	it seemed dangerous.
b	Yeah.
b	Okay.
sd	I have high hopes for him.
sd	I mean in the Democratic primary, I'm going to vote for Brown just because I kind of like Brown and his attitude.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
ny	Yes,
sv	Well, I think that's a big part of it
sv	but yeah, I think that's a big change .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes.
sd	but as long as I w , you know, was going to work I was going to do as much as I could, as well as I could et cetera.
sd	And I wanted to stay home when I had kids.
sd	And we would like two more
aa	Yeah.
sd	It's full time work.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	of course, you know, everything you give up something
sv	But I do think that's one of the major changes. {D You know,
sd	And if she worked it was part time
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	and I think,
b	Oh.
sv	But see, it's such an important time to be home. You know.
sd	And that, was important to me enough,
sd	you know, my husband was raised,
sd(^q)	and he's like well, you know, what's the big deal about being home, for your kids.
sd	Well, as our kids are getting older, you know, he sees it more.
sd	or, she was there to take you,
sd	and I want to be able to do those things
b	Yeah.
ba	I think that's wonderful.
qw	So, where do you see, us changing in the future?
sd(^q)^t	Well, see that was one of the things the question I think is, you know, what changes do we see
sd	and I'm not sure I see it go anywhere.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	The day care eats, me alive.
sd	You know, I pay four hundred fifty to five hundred fifty, a month for two kids .
sv	They would eat you, alive.
aa	I know.
nn	No,
sd	You know, so I feel good about them being there
sd^r	It's just not.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
ba	That's wonderful.
ba	I like that.
sd	Well, we're working on it.
sd	I feel like, that's good
no	Well, I, I don't know.
sv	obviously, if it's all compatible and it, you know, tens
aa	Right.
sd	and they were ready,
b	Right.
sd	So I think that's what they did at first, was that they had metric
sd	and I mean, and there's things that we've gone metric.
sd	you can buy that
sd	you know, so that, we have little things that are metric,
b	Uh huh .
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sv	It would be difficult,
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right .
b	Right.
aa	That's true.
sd	Well, I was trying to think of what kind of things you'd have to change,
sd	When you wouldn't be five foot eight anymore, you'd be a hundred and seventy centimeters,
sd	and then you'd be lighter in kilograms than you were in in pounds.
sv	So all the dieters would be happy .
^q	I only weigh sixteen today.
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	Right.
^q	Just so you'll know,
aa	Right.
sd	I, I don't think they are, because our measurements started in England,
sd	all that began back there,
b	Right.
^2	We're the trend setters in the world.
h	I don't know.
b	Right.
sd	Well, pounds,
sd	See, and I don't understand liquid ounces and fluid ounces.
sv	It's not like it's really entrenched other, you know.
b	Right .
ba	Well, that's good.
b	Oh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
qy	Did you ever check it to see if it really was, a pint?
b	Right.
sv	you all are nice business .
b	Right.
b	Right .
sv	Probably ate all your merchandise too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
aa	Yeah,
b	oh.
b	Okay Carol.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Surely.
qy	You mean they don't have the smog alerts?
b	Right.
bh	really .
b	Yeah.
sd	I was born in L A
sd	the worst city in the world is actually, Mexico City.
ny	Yes.
sd	The worst one for smog is Mexico City.
sd	The most polluted city in the world .
b	Yeah.
sd	some things they do, one of them is they're using corn in fuel.
qy	You ever heard of that?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	that's one thing that they do.
sd	unfortunately, it still contributes to global warming cause, you have to, you know, wipe out forests to grow corn and things like that.
sv	It doesn't make sense.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Drive cars with catalytic converters, and all that.
sd	And, they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically,
sd	So the engine kicks on when the batteries need power
sd	Interesting thing about I mean, about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light, you're not using any energy .
sd	Unlike a car where it's running.
sd	A electric car it's on demand.
o	Basically.
sd	You don't have to shift .
sv	Very interesting.
b	Yeah.
sd	And Ford and General Motors and all those compete.
aa	Right.
sd	G M, Chrysler announced that they're going to, they're,
b	Yeah.
bf	To operate, yeah.
sv	Kind of interesting so see.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
sd	I wasn't there too long ago.
qy	Well, you know, going over the hills, you know, coming into the valley? .
sd	You can see that horrible, horrible brown haze.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
sd	well, only my grandmother, but for a very short time.
sd	physical therapy was there and whatever,
b	yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	But when the time comes, and she can't do things
sd	but if she wants to go to a meal, she can go down the hallway, to a room where there's a cafeteria
sd	and there's other people there,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
sd	I mean, see, I know that my grandmother would like to stay in her house,
sv	That doesn't necessarily mean you're controversial.
sv	Well, I think that those crimes which are punishable by the death sentence, need to be reevaluated.
sd	I think there are other crimes that could easily draw the death penalty and not make me feel bad at all.
sd	Crimes against children is one of them.
b	Yeah.
sv	You know, if you kill, you lose your life.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Innocent people could do that,
b	 Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think then that a life sentence to restitution is appropriate.
sv	I think he should spend the rest of his life working to support that individual or the family of an individual. who has been harmed you, you know.
sd	People who kill policemen.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ar	I don't agree with the length, of the sentence though.
sv	I think expediency is the answer.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	you can appeal it once.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
sv	I mean, you know the guy is guilty.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And, I just don't think that,
qy^d	I hope you're not a lawyer .
b	Yeah.
aa	Absolutely.
sv	But I really believe that our justice system is the best around
aa	That's right.
aa	That's right.
aa	That's right.
sd	that really does ruffle my feathers, at times.
sd	I mean I can just get so, aggravated about it.
sd	on Rutherford.
sd	It's, corner of New York just west of Mayfield.
bk	okay.
b	Oh.
sd^t	Let's see, we're on government, whether we think it's honest or can be.
sv	I don't think under the way the system is right now, it is.
sv	The ultimate power, ultimately corrupts.
sd	I don't know if, there is enough money that you could pay them just, you know X amount of money to keep them honest.
sd	I just don't,
aa	Right.
sd	here in Oklahoma we had a few years ago a major, corruption on our county commissioners
sd	and there were several counties, including the one I was in, that lost every one of their county commissioners
sd	they were taking kickbacks.
b	Yeah
sd	Just a little here, a little there.
sd	Major amount here, a major amount there.
sd	But I think there was something like, you know, thirty or forty commissioners that ended up going to jail.
sv	that's small scale.
aa	That's right.
sv	The cover ups and,
h	I don't know.
sd	I think that's what upsets me worse than, that they're getting a little, you know, on the side that, it seems that when they get up there it's if I vote your way, what it'll do for me rather, than this is the way my constituents want it.
^2	run,
sv	I don't think that anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government.
sd	Well I wonder if they really were, or if we just really didn't,
fp	Hi.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I used to have a ton of gas credit cards,
sd	and I don't drive that much.
sd	But, as long as,
sd	And so, I tend to buy almost all major purchases on a credit card, when I have the choice.
sd	And, I used to even use it for my grocery shopping and stuff.
sd	And so I don't.
sd	but it's not really a credit card .
na	it's a debit card,
sd	And, just, you know, many times you get out of the store faster if you pay with that than if you pay with cash.
ny	yeah.
b	Right,
aa	Yeah,
sd	And, you know, I'll forget to pay the bill by the due date,
sd	And you know, so I thought I,
sd	But they have no proof of that.
sd	I had that hassle one time
sd	and months later they were still telling me that I owed them finance charges and, late fees and things like that.
sd	You know, kind of the ,
aa	Right.
sv	And, I mean you can't do that,
b	Right.
aa	Right.
sd	Well, that's basically what happened with us is we bought a computer,
sd	We need to just put external cards in
sd(^q)	And then they said, well then don't pay it.
sd	But it's sort of, you know,
aa	Right,
sd	So I learned that for the next time.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, my husband and I both have that
sd	and I'm not quite sure what it is for him.
sd	but, in the past you know, there are some places that only take American Express
sd	and then they don't have the credit limit because I've over done the credit limit on the other card,
sd	And, with the American Express they say there is no limit.
b	Yeah,
sd	Because there are some,
b	Yeah,
nn	No.
nn	No.
sd	and sometimes it comes in right away
sd(^q)	Because like many times I'll buy some things towards the end of the month thinking, hey, I won't get that bill until the next bill, not this bill.
sd	And it will come in on the next one,
sd	But sometimes the is long .
b	Yeah.
bf	Immediately.
sd	but, that's what happened with us
sd	and I got billed like the next day .
sd	It didn't matter because we couldn't have paid for it by check
sd	You can, return it so like the washing machine we bought it in October
sd	And somethings like that are,
b	Right.
bf	Or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be
sd	and so that's, you know, another advantage. And then even things like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which, hopefully you never use.
nn	No,
nn	No,
aa	No,
b	Uh huh.
b^m	One.
b	Uh huh.
b^m	Ten.
aa	Yeah.
qw	What kind is it?
bh	really.
b	Uh huh .
br	A what?
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do they?
aa	Yeah,
h	I guess.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh,
ny	Yeah.
sd	That's what I heard.
aa	Uh huh.
aa	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
qy^d	You all don't have any other children around there?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
ba	yeah .
aa	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aap	That's probably right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Uh huh.
b	Huh,
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
sd	Probably doing outdoorsie stuff, and trying to keep them away from the T V, I guess . And, McDonald's .
sd	I always said that if I had a kid they wouldn't know what McDonald's is.
sv	But , they learn from their friends,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sd	This lady in our bass club, we had a tournament yesterday
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
sd	That's the kind I like.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
ba	yeah.
b	Uh huh,
sd	I heard it's twenty bucks a whack.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
ba	yeah.
sd	That's why I lucked out,
sd	I'm in a ranch.
bh	Really?
qw	How many square feet do you have?
qy	Four bedrooms?
b^m	Five bedrooms.
sd	I made a fourth bedroom out of, made a fourth bedroom out of our living room and then added what we call a sunroom to get the, you know,
sd	when we added four hundred square feet to our house
qw	How many stories?
qw	How are they built?
b	Yeah.
qy^d	But I mean it doesn't give you trouble?
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	No cracked slab or anything like that?
bk	All right.
sd	And is it, a natural gas and,
qh	You know what I miss though?
sd	I sure wish they could build basements in homes in Texas.
qy	Can you stand up in it?
qy^d	So you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here.
sd	ours is pitched so shallow that you, don't get much room in the attic.
bf	So, five bedrooms and two family t ,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qh	Isn't it funny how families end up living in one room in the house most of the time.
b	Right.
sd	I mean might as well not even heat and cool it.
sv	Strange.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
ba	Wow.
sd	We've been fifteen years in the house that we're living in.
sd	And the principal feature I like about ours is that it's pier and beam.
qy^d	Yours is a slab I assume.
b	Yeah,
sd	I've done a lot of electrical and plumbing and other work by myself and saved a lot of money that I couldn't have done if the house was on a slab.
sd	But that's because it's so old.
sd	It's thirty five, thirty six years old when they used to build like that,
aa	I know,
sd	I, on the other hand, do a lot too much of it
b	Right.
sd	Well, you know, they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers
sv	but, you know, it's pretty hard to try, let's say, the man down the street that's living on Social Security or somebody that's on a limited income to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people,
b	Okay
b	Okay
sd	But then there's another thing that I disagree with in Texas is sometimes you have a jury of six
sd	And I don't know why they do that.
bk	Okay,
b	Okay .
sv	Well, we know there's a few out there.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and that's more money spent.
aa	No.
sv	And it's not working either.
sv	It seems that we have more and more repeat offenders.
aa	I know,
sd	And it's overcrowded.
sd	They turn them loose.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, it seems the way it's been working here's,
b	Yeah
b	Yeah.
b	All right.
b	All right.
aa	Yeah,
sd^r	And that would give, you know,
sv	Sometimes it's pretty messed up,
b	Yeah.
sd	and there's another thing about the justice system that I don't like
sd	and when you're in jail, they take you out just like they do in Alabama or anywhere else, what they call a chain gang.
sd	And they clean the city parks.
sd	And they clean the city streets.
b	yeah,
sd	but I know families myself that have three and four children in Lubbock that don't make that much.
sd	And you know, they're not doing anything to support themselves, while they're there.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	And something else that I would, And something else that I would like to see is, victim reimbursement, you know, because they, you know, like you say these guys are in jail
sd	and they're working,
sv^m	has nothing, you know.
sv	they know how to deal with the penal system
sd	I strongly disagree with any judge passing sentence on a person himself.
aa	Yeah,
sd	the jury gets to see the whole trial, as does the judge,
sv	Whereas the jury may have a little, shall we say, sympathy, you know,
^q	is there a basis for it.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	and you'd have more than one person's input on it.
sd(^q)	And, you know, we're supposed to be, and I quote, in a democratic society.
sv	And a lot of jurors,
aa	Yeah
na	Sort of.
ny	Yeah.
na	they do it before you go in
ny	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sv	you have, to do randomly otherwise people will cheat.
b	Yeah.
sd	and then when that urinalysis came around they would be all scared.
sv	The only problem is, you know, if you have done drugs but you've stopped and, you do get caught, it is kind of harsh.
b	Yeah.
sd	we get counseling
sd	I don't do any drugs
bf	Crazy.
aa	Yeah,
ny	Yeah.
qo	what do you think about our, like, other government agencies testing?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	I know,
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	see, that's,
sd	I've heard of that,
sv	I believe you should have the testing
aa	Uh huh,
fc	Well, it was nice talking to you Rose.
fc	Okay .
fc	Bye bye.
ny	yeah,
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I definitely wouldn't dispute that,
sd	Well, about a year I guess.
sd	It just turned two, I believe.
aa	Pretty much,
b	Okay.
ba	that sounds interesting.
ba	that's neat.
b	Yeah,
aa	Most definitely.
aa	I wouldn't doubt it,
ba	Well that's understandable,
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Okay.
aa	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sd	She's definitely ready to get out and run around.
b	Really.
ba	wow.
b	Yeah.
b	Okay.
b	Okay.
b	Okay.
aa	Most definitely.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sv	it's a matter of exposure really.
sd	and, the dog kind of felt out of place then because she was being fed, and everything else from all directions.
ar	She really did,
br	pardon?
sd	it's, Mitzi.
aa	Yeah.
bk	okay.
b	Yeah.
bk	I see.
aa	Yeah,
sd	And he was a real lovable type, but, definitely not an apartment type animal
sd	so he had to stay home.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
aa	Most definitely.
ba	Well that's great.
fc	That sounds real good.
fc	You too.
sd	Well, we, remodeled a bathroom. which required, completely repainting the bathroom,
sd	and the other project we've done around here is, we've remodeled all our closets which required quite a bit of painting.
nn	No,
ny	Yeah.
qy	Is this a project you did yourself?
qw	what brought about the fading of the paint?
bk	okay,
qy^r	Latex?
b	Uh huh.
qy	On the ceiling?
b	Yeah.
aa	No,
qw	what kind of paint did you use on the ceiling?
bk	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Seems like, we've done some remodeling of some, rental houses that we have
sd	and it appears as though that, in the fifties or sixties when some of these houses were built, they used a lot of, semigloss type enamel for ceiling paints
sd	and that was a little difficult to cover with today's paints, it seemed like.
aa	Yeah.
qy	You had pretty good luck with one coat type paint?
qy	Weather beater type stuff?
b	Yeah.
ba	Understand.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Well, the particular bathroom that we did is a half bath,
sd	I've, have never experienced that type of a problem with a latex paint.
sv	So, you shouldn't have a problem with it.
sv	they're pretty well refined today a lot of the paints,
sv	and Sears is one of the better ones.
sd	I've used, many a gallon of them, myself.
na	used oil base paints for trim you know, like around doors and on doors, things like that.
sd	primarily because it seems to be a little more, well, let's say
sd	And, you know, it, it gives you a variance even though it's the same color.
sd	So it's worked out pretty well for us.
na	quite a bit,
ad	make sure it's nice and brown on both sides
ad	And then you, pour all of the oil out of the pan
ad	Then you, pour that in there, you know, to make the gravy.
sv	And it's going to be really good .
b	Yeah,
aa	Right,
b	Yeah.
na	well it will be in a little while,
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	What kind of wok do you have,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	that's, That sounds real good except the squash,
sd	I just don't like squash.
sd	I never did.
sd	And maybe she'd have chicken or something.
sd	And I'd just be,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that sounds good.
aa	Right.
ba	Wow.
sd	You wouldn't believe it, we even raised chickens .
qy	You ever seen anybody kill a chicken?
sd	And they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off.
sd	Getting ready to eat chicken too.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well that's good.
b	Yeah.
ba	Ugh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
ba	Ugh.
aa	right.
bf	The spice,
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well I might have liked some of that
sd	I really do.
h	I don't know,
sd^t	well this is my first one.
ba	wow.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Goodness.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Well, okay.
fc	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Ugh.
b	Yeah,
b	Okay.
fc	All right,
ar	Well no,
sd	and I drove a nineteen seventy seven, B M W
sd	But I'm not interested in having any car payments,
sd	But I also found a nineteen eighty Volvo, station wagon that was in just super condition.
sd	I mean there's not a dent on the outside body,
sd	it has about eighty thousand miles on it
sd	and I think it would last me probably another fifty or sixty thousand miles.
sd	So, I guess I'm kind of in limbo waiting to see what the insurance you know, company is going to do, to see whether or not I can get one of these cars.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well not only that, needing the room, you know, we finally ended up buying a Dodge Caravan here about two and a half years ago, because I too, have very small kids.
sd	And you know it's like you go on a trip
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	We have definitely put a lot of use in on ours
sd	and my husband's been in business for himself for several years
sd	used to be you kept them three years.
sd	Well when they did all the tax law changes you had to keep them five.
sd	So I was trying to keep my B M W in tact, for three more years. So that then I could take the van,
sd	And so basically that's what I'm looking for in a used car. Something that's going to last me at least three years.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Know how that goes .
aa	That's right .
aa	I know,
sv	and you just almost can't find that payment anymore.
sd	So, I understand that, it's kind of hard to go do.
sd	And we have had just wonderful luck with ours.
sd	which drove me nuts trying to get car seats and kids, into a back seat, you know.
sd	And so it's wonderful to have the room and the space
sd	And it is nice on long trips.
sd	and they come out fairly easily, so we took out the middle seat, put the car seats in the back and just had a whole area in the middle, like if we were out on open road
sd	You know, I wouldn't do that if we were in a city, or, if there were a lot of cars around or anything.
sd	But it made it so much easier to travel.
b	Uh huh,
ba	yeah.
aa	Sure,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ba	Well that would be good.
ba^r	That would be good.
fc	Well, I appreciate talking to you.
sd	Well, really I'm supposed to hear today
sd	and you know, my B M W that my husband was going forty to forty five miles an hour
sd	Well, we lived,
sd	and we did a lot of gardening out there, and, mostly in raised beds so we could keep the, soil nice, because basically out there it was mostly a clay soil, very hard to grow, very hard to cultivate,
sd	and we've been planting flowers that we could never plant, in San Antonio because the heat would just dry them up after, you know, about three good weeks of nice weather before the heat started
sd	and, we're at the edge of a forest area, so there's a lot of pine mulch .
sd	Just about anything you would want in Texas as a gardener is here just around us.
ny	Yeah,
sd	But, that has been the major change that we have noticed in gardening,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	So do you have to get a shade tolerant grass?
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Just get grass to grow.
sd	Well, when we had our house, out in Castroville, the problem with ours is that the, plots there are a third of an acre . And trying to keep grass alive during a summer on a piece of ground that big was expensive .
sd	To water it
sd	we were just watering all the time.
sd	And so when we left, you know, the back yard had some,
h	But, I don't know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Okay,
b	Uh huh.
sd	there's so much money
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right,
sd	and then when it comes to fertilize, then it would come to raking,
sv	People that were building the new homes that put those in, that was the only way to go because it was just so convenient.
sd	But there is a grass that you can use that is shade tolerant,
sd	It's just a real fancy decorated boot.
sd	and I think one of them was a blend of two types of grass that they had used.
sd	But I do remember they had used a blend.
sv	but that's so neat, because so many homes don't have that.
sv	It makes the biggest difference, when you have the big old trees.
sv	So, that's great that you have them.
ba	that's even better.
b	All right.
sd	My husband didn't like it that much.
sd	So, the end scenes are kind of suspenseful, you know, when she realizes he's in the house, you know, after her,
sd^r	You know, why didn't she just tell hi ,
qw	But anyhow, what have you seen?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bf	And the drugs let them come back.
b	Oh .
qw	Well, how bad were the side effects?
b	Oh.
b	Oh .
qo	Well how about KINDERGARTEN COP?
sv	You know, Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting to be, a bit of a variety actor, you know.
sv	But he's kind of branching out.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	Well, there was a movie out,
sd	I thought that was just great.
sd	I even like I mean, some of the original stuff,
sd	but I still like watching him in THE TERMINATOR. and some of the other things.
sd	TOTAL RECALL last year I thought was really good, last summer.
sd	Guess it didn't last too long at the box office,
sd	but I thought it was pretty good.
b	Yeah,
sd(^q)	and I just keep telling her, how can you do that?
sd	And she watches these really gross things you know, like, THE NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and, you know, that kind of, junk.
sd	I don't go for that at all.
sd	I remember when I was real little, we all went to some kind of scary movie,
o	You know,
sd	You know, they tell you that kids can, you know, be impressed by all that stuff,
sd	I had a lot of things that I,
sv	But I think a lot of kids, it's funny, get the same kind of fears, like there's somebody under the bed.
qw	Where do we get that from?
qw@	 How old are they?
sd	but I remember, I was with a friend of mine, had, three kids,
sd(^q)	And he just bawled at the end and just she's not going to die.
sd(^q)	And we were trying to say, Kenny, it's okay,
sd	He just was beside himself, you know,
ny	yeah
fc	You too.
b	Uh huh.
ba	How weird.
sd^t	It was discuss air pollution, causes of it and cures.
sd(^q)	I was going, well .
b	Uh huh.
ad(^q)	Say, well, I know it takes a fishing pole and some bait, and some water .
fc	All right.
sd	Although at least Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	You know, because other states quite a bi , a chunk out for, city and state taxes
sd	A little more take home here .
ny	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
bk	okay .
b	Yeah.
sd	Or up to Collin County, somewhere that you're getting out of the, Dallas County area because, what do we pay, like eight and a half percent, something like that for the, sales tax.
sd	Which, yeah, that really is pretty high.
na,sd,o@	I think so, although I really, don't go up there too much, I mean I normally just kind of go to Richardson Square Mall, or Valley View Mall just kind of for the convenience, / * Looks like 2 slash units
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sv	Although I wish, you know, overall they'd try the lottery again.
sd	well, Ohio, kind of.
sd	but, you know, basically I went to high school and college in Ohio and lived there more years than I ever did in Michigan.
bk	okay .
sd	But you know, when we first came down here, I really thought this place was somewhat backward, I mean, I was just shocked that we couldn't shop on Sunday.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy(^q)	Were you shocked like, no, I'm stuck I need to buy stuff.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	Well the, there was other things too, I mean, I think it's taken us Yankee's influence down here, to get them to, come to the, you know, the correct decade here and century.
sd	I mean, you could always, be careful about that back then because, you know, if a cop stopped you then you would, you know, get arrested or what not.
sd	And people would just drink openly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
bf	So you end up about paying about twelve dollars for a pack and two dollars of that is taxes.
b	Huh.
qy^d	They're cheaper there?
ba	Oh!
bk	I got you,
b	Uh huh
qw	Well how did you do?
b^m	A dollar, well,
sd	Seems like wanting to go to the Peace Corps was something that I had really wanted to do when I was young.
sv	But, I don't believe they accept you you know, after you're married
qy^d	they will?
sd	I didn't know that.
qy^d	Then there's no age limit?
qy^d*	Your kidding. / * typo > you're
ba	Goodness I'm surprised.
sd	Well, , I don't really think that they should be, it should be mandatory.
sd	that just might not be something that everybody wants to do,
sd	I don't see how that can make a better class of Americans to make it mandatory for everybody to participate.
aa	That's true.
b	Yeah,
bk	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	that, that's true.
sd	Thousands, and thousands of people are out there looking for jobs.
ar	, no,
b	Uh huh.
bk	okay.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
aa	All right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	well, yes,
sd	Well, they wish for the money
aa	Right.
b	Yeah.
b^m	Total gun control.
aa	Yes,
sv	But I think personally, that we do need some weapons available to most of the people.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	I don't think we should have access to those.
b	Huh .
b	Yes.
sd	and he was showing me that at a hundred yards, he kept five shots within a quarter of an inch of each other at one hundred yards.
sd	just from a technical point of view, that interests me. Not to kill anybody with it or anything with it, but just the fact that a piece of mechanism like that could be made to be so accurate.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes,
sd	My aunt is planning it.
sd	Missouri.
sd	Southwest part of Missouri.
na	That will be where it is. if she gets it planned.
sd	I have been out of town,
sd	All my aunts and uncles.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	I will probably have to take charge and do it one of these, days.
sd	But, I still have elderly parents alive.
sd	So, it takes a lot of effort to either get everybody called or written and settle on a date, you know that,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my gosh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
aa	it is.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bh	Is that?
bh	Is that right?
ba	That is wonderful.
sd	well, we need to have another one.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	we have it usually at this one park because there is a pavilion there, in case it rains.
sd	And, you have to have it, fairly early in the summer or it is too hot up there.
na	In Missouri,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Isn't that great?
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
o@	But, Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	Every family has all that going on,
aa	I do too.
no	I do not know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, time flies so fast,
sd	So, anyway I hope both our families get to have one soon.
b	Yeah.
sd	I know when we had, had our,
b	Uh huh.
ba	Lord.
^h	I am telling you.
aa	No,
b	Yeah.
fc	Enjoyed talking to you.
fc	Good luck in everything.
fc	Bye bye.
fp	Hi.
b	Okay.
aa	That is very true.
sv	but, bet right this moment, you probably have several loans out
sv	But, see our whole system is built on owing not borrowing.
aa	true.
aa	Well, now I agree, I agree with you one hundred percent.
sd	I'm just taking the other side so we'll have a discussion here.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I have one way to suggest reducing the budget.
sd	Very simple.
sv	Now give them, what a week, I think we here at T I get a total of eleven a year.
sd	And that's about, three or four less than civil servants get.
sv	Now just look at that money the government could save if they didn't have all of those days off, all those holidays.
sv	Well, now don't forget the mail is something else again.
nn	No,
nn	No.
sd	That's why the price of mailing a letter keeps going up.
sd	You know, I could I can remember the days when it cost only three cents to mail, a letter.
b	Yeah.
qo	Well, what about, sending all this money overseas supporting other governments, third world governments.
sv	Well, in so many cases, it's not a loan,
nn	No.
sd	And, World War Two debts have never been repaid.
sd(^q)	And said, well, we'll cancel it just like they did to that Polish debt here, last week.
sd	half the countries of the world simply canceled the Poland debts to help them.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I don't believe in a single government or a single control for the world.
sv	that's asking for trouble.
sv	I mean you could travel from one coast to the other here in the U S and find a tremendous differences between the peoples.
sd	So, therefore, I don't believe there could be a single government for the whole world.
o	sure,
sv	That's a big laugh,
sv	We've got too many, immigrants.
sd	They don't call them immigrants anymore,
aa	Yes.
sd	My grandfather came over from Lithuania back, just before the turn of the century
sd	and, as a matter of fact he's a draft dodger.
sd	He, was supposed to serve some time.
sd	And he came back.
sd	I just sort of blanking tonight.
b^m	THELMA AND LOUISE,
ny	Yeah,
ny	yeah,
sd	this is the,
aa	right.
qy	Have you seen that?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	And I'd heard it was really good, too
nn	No.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	I mean it kind of runs in, in batches,
qw	what kind of movies in general do you like to watch?
b	Uh huh.
nn	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh
sd	in fact, I, I'll, I'll look for it because I ,
b	Actually yeah,
sd	And, I'm sure that, that would make it worth her watching.
sd	my, my movie watching has, severely, has changed a lot since I got married.
ny	Yeah,
sd	and so I, I, I, I really, I used to watch a fair number of foreign films.
sd	And I find I don't do it anymore or else I have to watch them on my own.
^2	Find something both of you will watch.
sv	it's funny because most women aren't really,
ny	Yeah,
sd	Keep her on the edge of her seat.
sd	But, so it, it varies,
aa	Well, yeah,
sv	they won't come within ten feet of, all the ya . All the sounds of the karate chops flying through the air .
ny	yeah,
nn	No,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Huh .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I have five in the kitchen at the moment.
sd	I have three of my own
sd	They cause more noise pollution than air pollution .
aa	That's right,
b	Yeah.
sd	I remember being,
sd	and, I can remember the smell of Newark vividly .
sv	And it's the type of industry, you know, which obviously if you can smell it, it's in the air.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Then it just gets into the soil and into the water .
b	Yeah.
sv	I think we've got to do more with the recycling.
b	Yeah.
sv	at least they're starting, you know.
sv	So at least they're moving that direction.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it's probably going to be a generation or two before, before it's really going, very well, because now the adults are more aware of it,
sv	and the children are being taught in the schools it'll be, you know, on down the road this is going to be passed on, which is good.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	and as we educate them individually what they can do, people become more aware of the things in industry too that are causing problems
b	Uh huh.
t3	I'll turn it up in a minute, honey, when I'm done .
b	Uh huh
sd	I think they teach it a lot in science .
b	Yeah.
sd	I, I think they're kind of getting it in all different grades.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sd	if you go in the entrance, they've got, stands usually where they have, kind of a little newspaper thing that the kids can read
sd	and , and they can form a group to,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, I know it's a hard problem to solve because you know, like McDonald's has changed back and forth between paper and foam and that kind of thing,
sd	and they do all these studies on which ones pollute more,
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I guess the big discussion, just kind of what you were mentioning, has been the color.
sd	and we put a flat over the top,
sd	Every time the sun would come up in the morning I'd see another spot and have to drag out the paint can.
sd	Well, it's not too bad.
sd*	and it's really not to bad to get off, / * typo to > too
nn	No,
b	Okay,
b	Yeah.
ba	gosh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	you know, you're not nearly as concerned with a barn or a grainery, or something like that as you would be with your own house.
na	a little bit,
b	Yeah
b	Yeah.
ba	gosh,
ny	Yeah,
sd	But, It's gone pretty well.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
ny	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
sd	they're in pretty good condition, as far as, major repairs. You know, a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that,
b	yeah,
sd	live in Dallas.
bk	Okay,
nn	No,
sd	In fact, we were planting flowers this weekend .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
o	but, no,
ny	yeah,
ny	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
nn	No
b	kay.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	really.
sd	that's great, because they don't have it in Florida.
sd	I mean, you know, like I say, I'm in New York
aa	Right,
o@	I think if it were to be, if it were to be, hold on a second please, someone just walked in the ro , * seems to me that the "hold on" should be a separate slash unit (marked 'ad'), and shouldn't continue into B.15 if it were to be spent in the right way I think I wouldn't be so upset about it, / * see B.13 note
sv	but given that it's not spent properly, I think it's a major problem.
b	Uh huh
sv	so they want I think they're trying,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I agree,
aa	Right,
sd	You know, but I'm not convinced, a , tha , that Social Security is doing as well as it should you know, and, and, and, and, and that, you know, those people who need it for welfare and so forth, who really need it for welfare, not the eighty five to ninety percent of them who don't need it. But I mean the real people who really need it, you know, should be getting it
qy	You think so?
aa	I know
b	Yeah
b	Yeah,
sv	it'd be nice if we sort of, as one, band together
sd	To see if we could sort of clean them up
b	Uh huh.
sd	I sort of get discouraged when I think about all the things that I think are wrong .
h	So, I don't kno ,
b	Yeah.
aa	Right.
aa	Right,
b	Right .
sv	They do forget, it's true, because everybody,
sv	So it becomes, a general battle of the sort of the election of the lesser of two evils, I think,
h	I don't know,
sd	and what I make isn't taxed very highly because I'm still in school.
sd	But my, my, my wife has a real job
sd	Especially around bonus time.
b^m	Bonus,
nn	no
sd	We're lucky to get paychecks the way I figure.
sd	my wife is taxed on her bonus as well,
sd	I mean her bonus isn't that much,
sd	So she gets destroyed on her bonus check.
sd	So, she works in, in sales.
aa	Yes,
h	So, I don't know,
aa	Same here,
aa	I, I do agree with you, most wholeheartedly.
fc	It's been a pleasure talking with you.
ft	Thanks for call.
fc	You too.
nn	No,
qy	Do you?
br^m	Have I?
nn	no,
bk	Okay.
na	Right.
aa	Okay.
aa	Right.
aa	Exactly,
aa^r	exactly.
sv	Especially when you have a family, with children, and you are always going to the doctor for,
aa	Exactly,
sv	they always do.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Exactly.
sv	Also, for working women I think a lot of the companies should start providing for day care in the, in the building.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	And it would be just,
sd	basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care, center.
aa	Exactly.
sd	Besides which, it would be easier, there's a lot of single mothers out there now, from divorces and a lot of, women are starting to have babies without a partner.
sv	And to go to work, you are worried about your child, besides which you have to get up earlier to take the child to day care.
sv	And if they were in the same building then you are going to the same place,
sv	and you could go for your lunch hour down and visit with your child, you know, and take your breaks with your children, or something.
sv	I think tha ,
sv	I think if the company could not provide it all on their own, for the people that would be using it, you know, a certain amount of their salary would go to it.
sv	But it would still probably be cheaper , with the company helping, if everybody, you know, pulled their own weight in it.
sv	I think it would be really. really great.
b	Yeah.
aa	I do.
sv	Eye care is good.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Right,
ar	Well, she does not have it,
sd	Her eyes are changing,
sd	and she has to be tested periodically.
sd	Now, I think your insurance covers her on that,
sv	but you know, for something like that, that's just as bad as a medical, you know,
aa	Right.
aa	Right.
sd	Now, I would like to see better dental insurance to me.
b	Oh.
bk	Okay.
sd	But, with the three children orthopedic care, not orthopedic, orthodontic care,
sd	because on a lot of the dental insurance, they do not cover that well.
aa	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Right.
sd	And it affects his speech a little bit, not anything, you know,
aa	Right.
sd	But just enough that his bite is off a little bit
b	Oh.
bh	Really.
sv	That sounds like it would hurt more.
ba	gosh.
sv	I think in some professions it's, essential. Things like pilots and things that involve the safety of other people particularly.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my goodness,
sv	that is a problem
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ny	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	however, here in Dallas we had a player, Roy Tarpley on the Mavericks team
sd	and he had been suspended a couple of times because of drug testing,
sd	and, just recently he was, missing from practice
sd	so they were able to get rid of him and not have to pay his contract.
sd	And so, in his case, he lost his whole career,
sd	and talk about a terrible role model,
ba	my goodness.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's terrible.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think most of us are.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes,
sd	the drunk and his wife in the car were killed,
sd	he went through surgery after surgery
sd	and for a long time they didn't even know whether he'd be normal again.
sd	He, has been tutored,
sd	He may never have all those motor skills back.
aa	No.
sd	Another thing that we saw here recently. some of our high school kids were out goofing around in a park area that a train track ran through
sd	and one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try to play with the train.
sd	he was in a coma for four months,
sd	he's out of the coma now,
sd	but he's lost,
ad	Well, let's talk about air pollution.
qw	What do you think causes air pollution in Dallas?
qy^d	Maybe you're not in Dallas.
bk	Okay.
sd	Well, I have some small experience in this area.
sd	But, one of the major problems that Dallas has is oxides and nitrogen.
sd	power plants since,
sd	And that's, course hydrogen sulfide, which is when you burn gasoline, you also produce some water vapor and that goes back in with your sulphur
sd	and under the right condition you get H two S.
bd	Well, I don't know.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Ron a lot of this is caused by the fact that cars sitting in traffic tend to run rich because the way the pollution is.
sd	And when they run rich they spit out a lot of hydrocarbons,
sd	Well, I guess, not trying to top you, but I grew up in Dallas county and I can remember when they built the north part of North Central which was built after the south part of Central
sd	and, I can remember coming over the hill down there long about, I don't know, little bit north of Mockingbird on up over those hills
b	Yeah,
sd	Right along in there somewhere, suddenly the air feels cleaner.
sd	Well, sometimes it depends on which way the winds blowing
sd	but, I also travel a little bit
qy	once a week, twice a week?
b	Yeah,
sd	but we both work
sd	really, I'm kind of open on food.
sd	Been on a real barbecue kick lately.
ny	Yeah.
b	Excuse me. yeah,
sd	I hate franchised restaurants.
sd^r	I despise franchised restaurants.
sd	I don't,
sd	You know, if I could have a good small restaurant or a good large restaurant I'd go to the good small restaurant.
sd	And I don't know why that is.
aa	Well, yeah,
b	Yeah.
br^m	It is what you look for?
b^m	isn't.
sd	And not just that, well, that's a big part of it. I try to get my money's worth. You know, and not just in quantity, you know, but quality, and flavor and texture and care.
arp	Well, presentation's not always all of it either.
sv	it's important.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	and just for color if nothing else.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
ny	yes,
b	Oh.
aa	yeah
sd	and in Texas we got it from the Gulf.
aa	And, yeah,
sd	I was like a man starving at every meal.
qy^g	It's a lot cheaper there, isn't it?
sd	It's like shrimp on the Gulf.
sd	That's as cheap as steaks some places I mean in a grocery store.
ba	my gosh.
sv	it sounds wonderful.
sv	That sound good.
sd	And, it's just so much different than to eat something that's been frozen. You know
sd	shrimp straight out of the bay.
b	Hm.
qy	Was it true?
b	Hm.
b	yes,
sv	they can do things to shrimp that no one else can.
qy	So, have you eaten crawfish yet?
sv	as with anything, it's preparation.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	So you do eat out a lot.
sd	One of our other real problems with going out to eat, Sunday morning brunches.
sd	You know, Sunday brunch, all you can eat brunches.
sd	we still find it fun.
sd	Well, I work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sv	it, it's the way to spend a nice Sunday morning.
sd	I think it's as much the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch. {D
sd	Colorado Springs.
sd	West
sd	west out of Colorado Springs.
sd	Well, as a matter of fact, I was thinking about that the other day,
sd	But, something that still has a lots of amenities and, you know, gadgets and things.
ny	Yeah,
b^m	Amenities.
b	Yeah,
b	yeah.
sd	but, I have preferences for some, makers over others,
sd	but, you know, I'm not so totally hung up on that, that I wouldn't buy something else,
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Oh.
b	Right.
aa	No
b	Yeah,
sd	and, even though they do a lot of the work themself just buying the parts and everything is pretty expensive.
sd	Well, I haven't really gotten that far with it,
h	but, I guess, I really don't know.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
aa	Uh huh.
sd	and, you knew it had been through a whole lot,
sd	and yet, you know, it held up pretty doggone good,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
aa	Yeah,
ad^t	Well, we talked long enough .
b	Okay,
fc	Bye bye.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	and you can move around.
qy	is that the Dodge Caravan, that does that
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and you can, move them around and stuff
sd	and right now we have a van which is,
sd	But, next year we'll probably buy a new car
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I think it's going to be a lot easier now.
sv	I think banks are going to be a little bit more lenient.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	Balance that and the house payment,
qy	are they twins?
ba	wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, the Honda's have been very safe. in accidents, more so that a lot of the American cars.
sd	Matter of fact I just heard something today on the news about those, automatic seat belts that are attached to the door
sd	they're questioning the safety of those now saying that,
sd	So they're saying they're not as safe as,
sd	And you're, you're required to wear them.
aa	Exactly.
sv	So, I mean, it kind of gives you a false sense of security.
sd	So, that, that's a concern of mine as far as, what I'll be looking at with buying a new car.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	and in, I think around nineteen eighty, they changed the model
sd	Literally, I mean it got chopped in half
b	Yeah.
sd	And my husband had a Honda,
sd	So, so we ended up,
qy^d@	to Williams College in Massachusetts? And that he was trying to decide between University of Pennsylvania and Williams,
sd	and it was a very difficult choice
o@	but that's one of the reasons why he chose Williams that it has solid liberal arts, * end of slash unit? About two thousand, / * should be indep slash unit. See B.8
sd	Very excited,
sd	Well, they're, they're really very strong academic rather than, you know, big sports,
sd	We're outside of, Washington in Maryland.
b	Uh huh,
b	Okay,
sd	one of the advices we've given our children is that you can always learn a job
sd	but what you can't learn, on a job, is a good solid well rounded education.
aa	That's right, you know,
sv	and if you get that you can,
aa	That's exactly right.
^q	do you want to go away,
^q	What do you want in a college.
sd	so he wanted to swim in school,
aa	That's right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	He is very, very strong academically,
sd	and yet he did wind up having to make a choice.
sd	It's got about nine thousand undergraduate.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yes,
sd	At Pennsylvania.
sd	Williams is an undergraduate school only
sd	and it's a total of two thousand.
aa	Yeah,
sd	and he had visited his brother at Amherst and knew that he liked the environment
sd	but he did go on college visits,
aa	Yes,
sv	it's large,
b	Uh huh.
qy	And did you ever eat at the Blue Bin Diner?
aa	No
sd	it
b	Uh huh.
sv	but, if you're going into,
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah
aa	Yeah,
sd	he had a great time
sd	and he said it almost back ,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	But I did,
sd	He had to look at himself.
aa	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I told him to look to yourself.
^q	but if it's a class of fifteen and you need help, you know that it's much easier to do it and especially in the large schools they have lectures
sd	and even though they may break it up into smaller groups Penn is known for having graduate assistance teaching.
sd	They have graduate assistants to teach the smaller groups.
sd	he made the decision, I'd say, about, an hour and a half ago .
aa	Yeah,
sd	I mean, and they were really nice,
aa	Yeah,
sd	My other son is just as happy as a bed bug.
sd	the moment he knew, he decided early on that Amherst was the school.
sd	and he also got into the graduate school of music as an undergraduate for classical guitar,
sd	but he decided he was going to go to the, the smaller now, and then graduate school later.
sd	Well, my older boy's real happy,
sd	he's going to be a junior.
sd	Well, you know, see the advice we give is to not limit yourself, especially this, you know, go to a school where you're not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, one of the things we said is that they should pick the college,
sd	Well, we place a real high priority on education in our family.
ba	good,
aa	That's right,
b	o , .
bk	okay.
bk	okay.
bk	okay.
sd^t	I've only made a few.
aa	Okay,
sd	When the phone rings and you've got a recording, and this always happens like around five or six o'clock, at night. It rings and you get this recording
sd	and then it won't go away
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
bf	They can leave their whole spiel on it.
b	Huh.
aa	yeah,
sd	And so it really doesn't make much difference as to whether or not, you know, you have a unlisted number or not.
sd	or they sell their catalog list of people, to different companies and everything.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah.
^h	Let's see, I'm trying to think.
sd	Well, I work in the computer science center
sd	And, this was a software program that a company was developing that was going to have X amount of million peoples financial history and information on it.
sd	And, they finally, stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused, because it was such a big deal.
sd	And I wouldn't have been too thrilled about it either.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and there it is.
sd	They just want that credit history to see if you're a person.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know that there's several people I've talked to that really have a problem with it
sd	so you get kind of used to, to going through stuff like that.
sd	You know, you don't pay any attention to it. I mean,
sd	once you sign over your soul to Uncle Sam, , you know, you just kind of, kind of blow it off
sd	So, I think the people who have been down that route or have had to deal with anything like that have learned, you know, it's just one of those things.
sd	But I do know that there are several sites .
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I don't think it's a necessary thing to publish it they just need to deal with it and, , on an individual basis.
sv	I mean, if they're going to do it, just deal with it and, be done with it.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I, I think it's a safety factor too because, you know, when people are inebriated, whether it's alcohol or drugs or whatever, they are very unsafe for their co workers, you know, it's like, you know, my father was a fireman
sd	and I can just imagine if, you know, , you know, some guy being on drugs they go there
sd	and they fall out because of the drug issue, you know. I mean you can forgive somebody because all of a sudden they maybe get hurt or whatever that you can understand / * Seems that there should be a slash after 'you know'
sv	but the use of drugs or anything like that, will, be a problem.
bh	really?
ba	That's good.
sd	I never really thought about that,
qy	Are they big into ambiance down there
sd	Texas to me makes
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	well we have a lot of favorites here, in Northern Virginia
sd	and there's all sorts of things down there.
sd	and he's got a big clientele
sd	we don't hang around with them, because usually it's, you know, ninety dollars a plate or something silly like that.
sd	So, but, my wife has a friend that runs one of the restaurants down there
sd	And, most French food always leaves me hungry for some reason.
sd	but the atmosphere is just wonderful.
sd	Well as out here you might have enjoyed the meal and go away feeling satisfied, it's not so much an event, you know, out in the suburbs when you go to a local restaurant.
sd	And they're starting to get a little bit different,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	We have two very special places in Northern Virginia that people go to.
sd	Maryland is, you know, a big place for crabs with the bay pretty much taking over most of Maryland.
sd	And, Captain Pell's is a place with the big huge wooden tables inside,
sd	And people come all over the country amazed at, the abuse they were seized.
aa	Yeah,
ba	wow.
ny	yeah.
sd	From the dock, from shore.
sd	mostly we catch carp.
ny	Yeah.
sd	They fight hard.
bh	Yeah?
b	Yeah,
qy	Are they good to eat?
qy	you mean size wise they're not very big?
b	Yeah.
qy^r	Are you fly fishing
b	Yeah.
sd	I've never even tried that.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	With the little thing on the end.
b	Yeah,
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d^m	you fish upstream?
b	Uh huh.
bf	You hope that they think it's a bug and, and eat it.
b	Yeah.
br	That's a fish?
bf	it's a lure.
bk	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
na	I guess so.
sd	but bait tends to work the best, just some blood bait.
qw	Where are you from?
sd	I'm from Midland.
sd	I went to college at Tech,
b	Yeah.
sd	I didn't catch anything,
aa	Yeah.
sd	Just from the heat of it all.
bh	It does?
sd	We were in Mesa Verde Park,
sd	And it was twenty eight, twenty nine degrees.
sd	We did not know what to do about it.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
sd	That's cold water around there.
bk	I see.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old.
sd	And the little one, of course, could care less.
sd	The, three and a half year old has just gotten to the point,
sd	And he started trying to cast it.
sd	He understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw, but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	yeah.
aa	Well, yeah,
br	I'm sorry, what?
sd	We're both,
sd	And he's in school, and everything else.
sd	Kathy and Kevin Guy.
b	Yeah.
sd	So that would be neat to, try it some time.
b	Yeah,
sv	long as you have a good time, that's the main point
aa^m	Definitely more to look at.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	and I guess the creek, the mountains were really starting to melt,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Okay.
qw	How many children do you have?
b^m	four,
sd	Well, I have two children and, two stepdaughters.
sd	So we have four altogether, too.
b	Yeah.
b	they are.
ba	well good.
ad	Impart me some wisdom, Catherine .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	so she's a little one.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Oh .
qy	Are you surviving.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
bh	Was she?
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
ba	that's nice.
qy	Do you get to see them?
ba	How nice.
aa	It is,
sd	And, you know, just so that they get to know their grandparents, but also for help .
sd	we don't have that luxury.
aa	They definitely do.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh,
sd	And they're part of the Plano Children's Civic Chorus.
sd	And they're going to Washington, D. C. next December . to sing for President Bush at the White House at Christmas time.
qy	Isn't that neat?
aa	Yeah,
sv	and I'm sure when your children grew up you didn't, you know,
sd	I certainly don't remember my parents running me here and there and supporting me in all these things,
aa	Yeah,
sd	But on the other hand, we just love watching the kids play and getting to know the other parents
sv	It's just different.
b	Yeah.
b^m	It's just very different.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really.
b	Yeah.
aa^m	It is very nice.
aa	Well, I think so,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes,
aa	Uh huh,
sd(^q)	Besides don't sweat the small stuff .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Absolutely.
^q	And you owe that back to God because he's given you that ability and that talent
sv	and and that's real nice.
sd	I'm real proud of her.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
ba	how neat.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And then I bought a van
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes,
sd	All the bugs and stuff .
sd	but I try, you know, to get out there and enjoy everything.
sd	But what was so fun though is that I had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends
sd	and it's all over him.
fe	shoot.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Right.
bf	Definitely when it's cool.
qy	Well, have you done much camping around Texas?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	Wow.
sd	See now I haven't so that,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
sd	Well, I know my parents like to camp a lot,
sd	They said they've got the white beaches and the sand,
sd	and it's not real populated so they feel like they're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean.
sd	And, from what I understand from them it's really, really pretty there.
b	Uh huh,
qy	Well, have you done much camping up in Kentucky and those parts, in the mountains?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	Yeah
sd	But we're getting more into it
sd	so that's good.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh,
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I, well, I have, a son that's, going to be eleven here pretty soon, and then a daughter that's thirteen.
sd	So, they're getting old enough to where they can help out with a campfire and, cooking and all that kind of stuff too.
ba	So, that's really neat.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No,
sd	But not on the regular basis.
sd	and I just couldn't do that, you know.
b	Yeah,
^2	Just getting away.
sd	But every Friday night they'll go home, you know, straight from work
sd	But anyway that's their life .
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Now that's true.
aa	Yeah
fc	Okay.
fc	Okay,
fc	Bye bye.
nn	No,
sd	I'm only twenty nine.
sd	So, social changes aren't that much for me either.
b	Well, yeah,
aa	Uh huh,
sd	I think so.
sd^r	I think so,
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sv	and and like you said, pro choice and whatnot.
sv	I think that's become more outstanding than it used to be where women, I think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something.
aa	No,
b	Right.
sd	and, you know, we didn't have to talk about,
sd	but, I'm not naive, to think that my children are not going to not do it.
sd	It wasn't that long that I was that young.
sd	And I've got a ten year old,
sv	and it's just different things you have to talk to them about now that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No,
sv	and it always will be,
sd	I mean, the boys are very open because that's all I have is boys, so that's all I'm around basically, is boys,
sd	but they talk about things that my brother didn't talk about until he was in college you know,
sd	and they sit down
sd	You can't give them, the, you know, Cabbage Patch answers and stuff.
sd	that just does not go.
sd	And they can tell me, basically some things that I don't know .
sd	But it's interesting, listening to them.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I know,
^h	let's see,
sd	some comedy shows, I can not think of, off hand,
qw	but, what are your,
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	I think it had some good situations that it presented.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, I think a lot of people, you know, kind of felt that way,
sd	and you know, that they called interaction between people and sort of to use as, as a way of getting people to talk about their problems,
sd	and that sort of thing .
sv	that tends to, put a cramp in your viewing, because by the time you get through getting her ready for bed and everything, it's, very little T V time left.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
aa	No,
sd	I notice it's like, it's like THIS OLD HOUSE,
sd	But, it's kind of interesting because they renovate an old house
aa	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sd	but, baseball to me is a little hard to watch on T V, for an extended period.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Right.
sd	I know we have done that too in the past,
sd	But, you know, we used to rent, two or three movies on a weekend and try to watch.
nn	No,
sd	we live in,
aa	No.
sd	but when they built our section did not put it in
sd	and they still do not have it
sd	I have contacted them about this
sd	and so they look
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Right.
fc	Alright,
nd	Well, I could pick country music. / * answered as if to a qw
sd	As I've gotten older, I've started listening more to the words of music and to the softer melodies.
ng	Not originally.
sd	Georgia.
qw	If you had to pick one, what would you choose?
sd	Well, I understand what you're saying.
sd	Well, there's some joy in it also.
no	I don't know.
sd	Well, I like groups like the Statler Brothers. And the Judds, certainly.
sd	Reba McIntire is a little too country for me.
aa	That's true.
ny	yes.
sd	That's certainly where her roots are.
na	Very much so.
aa	That's true.
sd	Well, it's just difficult for me to believe that anybody's ever going to make a record of the rap songs of the eighties.
b	Yeah
aa	That's true.
b	Yeah
b	Right.
aa	Of course.
sv	Well, the big key is that, I think you've already stated, that all music is rooted in the classics
ba	You bet.
fc	Bye bye.
ba	That's interesting,
sd	And I thought that was the best experience in that we had more one on one since we seemed to know everyone on campus,
sd	and we had a broad spectrum of languages and cultures and backgrounds, and so forth,
sd	so, I thought it was wonderful to be a bigger fish and not so much a number,
sd	one of fifty thousand, I was one of three thousand, and, you know, different perspectives,
sv	but it sounds like we were both kind of looking at the same sort of thing.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
sv	That's one thing to definitely consider.
b	Uh huh
b	Yeah.
sv	and whereas some would immediately feel very comfortable in this, larger university setting, some of the students, when I was teaching school would not have been comfortable with that.
sd(^q)	They needed, at least at first, they needed a smaller setting that was more like family where they could get one on one, from teachers, professors and so forth, and then after a year or two move on to a little bit bigger pond where, when they had a little more self confidence built up, yes, I can do this, I've done this before, it's just in a bigger setting,
sd	and so maybe to me the key would be what is a the, the students needs,
sd@	and what school or schools can best meet those needs besides education yo , you can expect all of them with, a , accreditat , accreditation to give the education / * seems that this should be 2 slash units, the second starting at "yo "
sv	but they're the things that don't show up in,
aa	That's right,
b	Right.
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I guess now I've been out for,
sd	And I was looking at an annual last night,
sd	and it was church related.
sd	And I got to looking at my class of sixty nine,
sd	and I realized that even though that school's two hundred miles from here
sd	and it's neat to know that we have that contact that goes back that some of the same memories if not the same education in,
sd	you know, we weren't all out to be teachers or whatever
sd	And it's, it's kind of neat just knowing that those kinds of things, those are what I carry beyond that piece of paper that allows me to be an exempt at T I,
sd	I have something more important to me than that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I was going to ask who won .
sv	in that case, regardless of what you or your father pushed for it sounds like she was going for what she needed, and finding a school that met her specific requirements, and made the best fit for her.
b	Yeah.
sd	I could live at home.
sd	But I chose to go to another school
sd	and I think I value my education more because I had to work for it.
sd	And because I knew all along that's what I wanted, even though I had to buck the family in order to do what I needed to do.
sd	I guess it was my mother's support that got me through it, that and ten years of, loans , after I got out .
qy^g	Sounds familiar,
b	Yeah,
sv	I'm sure it was worth it though.
sd	if nothing else because I work in training at T I now,
sv	if nothing else just those experiences beyond and including your educational classes that help give you the self esteem to do and achieve, whatever you set your mind on,
sv	and you made the right choice in going to a school that met all of your needs to give you the potential to do whatever you wanted.
sv	Young lady, you have gotten your education then,
aa	that's right.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, I think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and people getting less time and not serving any of the, or a lot less of the, time they're given by the court system,
h	but, I don't know,
b	Right.
sd	Well, there was an article in our paper Sunday that the average person sentenced to seven to ten years in North Carolina, serves six weeks .
sd	Well, see, we don't have any room in our prisons
sd	they shuttle them in and shuttle them out
sv	I think the general public is so overwhelmed by things right now, so many different things coming in so many different directions that they've just decided to become apathetic towards it all because they realize there's abs ,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I don't know what the answer is,
sd	I hope so.
sd	I definitely believe in capital punishment.
sd	it's when they're on death row for nineteen years that I'm kind of curious about.
aa	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sd	and then, after that it goes to the Supreme Court of the United States
sv	They're hoping,
sv	But it's just a,
sv	The fundamental problem is,
b	Uh huh.
sd	and they have community newspapers around here so their extremely local stuff is in the local paper that comes out once a week
sd	and then I get the Sunday, MILWAUKEE JOURNAL because I don't have time to read a paper.
sd	I get my news pretty much from the same sources as you do, although I do listen to N P R which has very good, and that's National Public Radio which has very good, coverage of the national and international news, and does a pretty good job of analysis as well.
nn	No,
sd	and when I'm not teaching, if I choose to have the radio on I can listen to that station,
qy	are you satisfied with the TWENTY TWENTY and FORTY EIGHT HOURS and the things that you do watch?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is the timely noting of the events as they happen?
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I, myself, the reason why I listen to N P R and the reason why I watch MACNEIL LEHRER, rather than the network news shows at night, although I do watch a local ten o'clock in the evening news which carries over a lot of the national news stories is that quite often it seems to me the national doesn't do a very good job of analysis.
sd	The local doesn't either
sv	And perhaps newspapers do that
sv	So. there is some danger to that, of course, too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture.
qy^g	you have young children, right?
qy^d	So those evening shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the T V set for awhile without interruption.
bh	you do?
b	Uh huh.
qw	When is your good watching time?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I have older children and getting dinner on the table.
sd	I come from the east coast
sd^t	We're supposed to talk about recent political developments.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think they probably have a better education than the average congressman.
sv	he, you know, we know he's a good leader,
sd	You know, Schwartzkopf was ordered to get Iraq out of Kuwait.
sd(^q)	And so he went to the President and said, okay, here's how I want to do it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, the thing that I'm wondering about is how we get a new congress.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sd	I think if the President, be him Republican or Democrat,
sv	I think the reason why we've got these guys in Congress is because of the fund raising rules.
sv	Basically the people,
b	Yeah,
sv	that's the easy way.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	You know, like, you know, the recent election about how the Dallas City Council should be made up, that election last December.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
^2	The manager.
sd	Well, what get's me is this thing, it went down to defeat last December by how many votes, by just a few hundred votes.
sv	And if it had passed,
b	Uh huh,
sd	but this is supposedly to benefit the minorities,
sv	and they would have had their way.
aa	Yeah,
sd	my position is people who don't vote don't have any right to complain about the way the government's going.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and you ask them why they don't vote,
sv^m	I think they could.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	In Presidential races that's about what they've done,
sd^t	Actually, I haven't made any calls,
sd^t	I think, yeah, I have to make these,
ny	Yeah,
sd^t	Well, I think we've used up as much time as we're supposed to anyway.
sd^t	We're supposed to do five minutes,
ft	Hey, well thanks for the call.
fc	Yeah,
b	Okay,
qw	why did you check music?
aa	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Like what kind of oldies?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
sd	and it is excellent.
qy	do you listen,
b	Okay.
o@	Really. * slash error at the same time, or, / * slash error should be qy
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	So, and, my wife played flute in high school.
b	Really
b	really.
sd	Actually that's exactly the same thing my ex wife did .
ny	Yes,
sd	Well, I like it,
qy	do you go to listen to much live music?
qy	Do you listen to much live music, like concerts or things there?
b	Uh huh.
qy	You know, you know whom I'm talking about?
sd	And he's coming to Dallas on the twenty ninth,
sd	My sons are kind of into Broadway.
sd	And he does it,
sd	and one of the,
sd	So, he's been to, they've been to see it several times.
b	Yeah.
qy	don't any of those ever come to Pittsburgh?
b	Sure.
ad	So if it comes to Pittsburgh in the road shows, and I think they have three different companies that tour the U S, you should go see it, because it's really outstanding.
b	Right.
sv	Well, I think it's just incredible.
ny	Yeah,
sd	And they went to it,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
bf	So he listens to New Wave
sv	That's kind of different.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, now we don't listen to much country,
sd	That is excellent.
sd	I mean, I've probably heard him,
sd	Garth Brooks is probably the only country album we have,
nn	Nope,
sd	so these are a bunch of old recordings.
sd	She bought that the same night we bought the Nat King Cole and the Garth Brooks.
sd	It is pretty good.
sd	it's a little too country for me,
sd	I like the Garth Brooks album a lot.
sd	It's pretty good,
b	Uh huh.
qw	which of his albums do you think is the best?
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I think we'll probably get one of his albums, because we do kind of like it,
sv	So, so it's good.
ny	Yeah,
^h	Well, let's see.
sd	So, I'm not sure how much I'm getting back
sd	It's not too much.
sd	Not too bad though .
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
sd	And, you know, taxes are one of the ways to help pay for a lot of the things that are needed in this society.
sd	I mean, everything you know, from medicare to social security to feeding the h , to, you know, feeding the homeless, to maintaining prisons, to maintaining polices or fire departments and things like that.
sd	but someone has to pay for it
b	Uh huh
b	Yeah.
sv	And, makes you wonder when there's, you know, countries out there that have, you know, tax rates of like close to fifty percent or higher.
sv	And that's kind of a scary thought.
sv	But, on the other hand, while those countries that have high taxes, also have things like, socialized medicine, things like that too, which are nice fringe benefits of it.
sv	And it's good
sv	I mean it can be argued one way or another whether economically it's actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that because those countries have be, tend to have a much slower cash flow and don't generate a, a large amount of revenue because there's so little, currency flow through out the economic system .
bd	Well, just keeping up with the times, that's all.
sd	as it turns out, you know, it's one of those interests , you know, I kind of like to keep up on.
sd	work hard to get, you know.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think in a way it's good, in a way it's not.
sd*	as far as the safety thing, in San Luis Obispo, for example, there's an ordnance which states that, there's no smoking in any public areas. / * typo ordinance
ba	okay, great.
b	Right.
sd	I do, quite a bit of sailing.
sd	and we take it out
sd	It's just I don't have a trailer hitch on my car anymore
sd	so it's hard for me to get it somewhere
b	Yeah,
sd	but you couldn't really sleep in there unless you sort of stuck your body out the hole, back into the main part of the sailboat.
sv	they can be black holes to throw money into .
sv	Boats are kind of expensive to maintain.
sv	Especially a bigger one.
sv	The bigger they are, if you get a big cabin cruiser or or a big ski boat, power boat, then there's always, stuff to go wrong with it.
sd	A sailboat at least doesn't have an engine to mess up,
sv	It takes a, a pretty good amount of maintenance to keep one up
sv	and when you work hard and you're under pressure and everything all week long, a boat can be a lot of relaxation, especially with a group of friends and cook out or camp out or whatever, or a cabin or something, depending on how much you like to rough it.
^2	Use the boat for transportation.
bf	They just go across the boat and tie it up and go in, huh
sv	That would be fun.
sd	I might just donate my little one to the scout troop and let them, keep it and maybe consider getting a better one for me.
ny	Yeah,
sd	And if you get a big enough one, then you've got a little motor on it also, where if it's light wind, you can still putt around a little bit and have fun.
sd	and you're just stranded out there trying to pick up what little gusts you can to work your way back in
sd	And if you're a big enough boat to have the little auxiliary motor on there, at least you can kind of drop the sails and putt on back in .
sv	But it's fun.
sd	I own an insurance agency, a managing general, a wholesaler of insurance, out in Addison
sd	and, I'm a scout leader, though,
sd	it's kind of hard to put my finger on a favorite T V program,
sd	It's going to be its last show.
b	Uh huh.
by	well, That's a shame.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Well, it's, it's,
b	Yeah.
sd	One from the east and one from the west.
sd	But it kind of confuses people.
sv	And then there's other ones that, deal with, in a funny manner, socially relevant things.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yes.
aa	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well I'm one of those rare guys, who, I rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event, if ever watch one.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well I think it was great when they were, you know, like world champs and they were doing real well.
sd	And, when I came down to Dallas, you know, I found myself rooting for the home team.
ba	wow.
o@	Huh. * slash error Yeah. / * should be independent slash unit
b	Huh.
b	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Gee, I'll have to try to catch that sometime.
b	Yeah,
aap	that's probably true.
sd	You know, having movies, back then it was ninety nine cents.
aa	Yeah.
sd	You can see them a lot sooner than you can see them on any of the stations like H B O or Cinemax.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yes.
aa	Yeah.
sd	And, so I'm hoping I can get her talked into it soon.
ba	That's great.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, capital punishment is a hard thing,
sd	There have been some things, you know,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	But, it's something that's really hard to deal with, the way that our justice system is right now, is basically set up in lawyers
sv	They are the ones with the rights.
sv	They have the right to, you know,
h	whatever they call them, you know.
aa	Uh huh,
sd	They can get continuances on for years, before the thing ever comes to trial
aa	Yeah,
sv	I think you know, that there needs to be a way that, you know, once someone has gone through, you know, a trial, I do not know how to fix it.
sv	You know, when someone has been,
aa	Yeah,
sv	when someone ha ,
sd	Well, even when someone has been convicted
sd	But appealing, you know, and continuing to appeal, like four or five or six times.
b	Oh.
sd	Okay, I could see that that might be the situation where, the person could be rehabilitated.
sd	Well, what bothers me,
sd	and they had told their teachers that I mean,
sd	and so that's what they did .
aa	absolutely.
sd	He stopped them for routine traffic violation
sd	we had gone out, with he and his wife
sd	And these people, you know, in the course of the trial, you know, came up with all these, you know, things about well, you know, they were disadvantaged and all this stuff.
b^m	And there's just no rea , I mean,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	You know, they stay in jail, they get off time for good behavior and all that stuff, and they get released .
sv	And they go right back and do it again.
b	Oh.
qw	And how big is it?
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
qr	Like washer, dryer or,
b^m	Nothing.
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah.
qw	Which one is it?
qw	Where is tha ,
bk	okay,
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	and, it's a three bedroom two bath,
h	and, it's, it, I don't know
sd	and, it's about sixteen hundred square feet, which is fine for the two of us.
sd	But it, you know, we looked at a lot of houses that had more square footage,
sd	but they didn't use it right, you know.
sd	It was a bunch of empty, you know, hallway and stuff that cur ,
aa	Yeah,
sd	so, you know, I think we you know, got a good deal on it.
aa	Yeah,
b	really,
aa	Yeah,
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh,
sd	But that's what we had,
b	Yeah,
sd	And, so that's what we went for first
sd	and, you know, some places have,
sd	But to stick a wall between two rooms didn't do anything for us just so we could have a living room and a den.
sd	So, we opted for the just, the whole wide room, that went from one end of the house to the other, just about.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	and you know, we have a,
sd	It is just really,
sd	And, we really liked it,
aa	yeah.
sd	But, it's nice
sd	And they've lived there and have it all built up, you know,
sd	we don't have a neighbor's fence coming up to ours. You know, right up to our bathroom window or whatever it is. Like a lot of the little model homes that they you know throw up in three days.
nn	No,
sd	in fact, we talked about that just a little bit, you know,
sd	we were joking around about, winning a sweepstakes, and what would we do with the money
sd(^q)	and Steve said we'll I'll buy a bigger house
sd	You know, you know cause I like where it is
sd	But when we found it, we knew it.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qw	Where?
bk	okay.
bk	okay.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
sv	and to put it all back into an apartment would just never work .
sd	God, I can't believe we moved out of an apartment and had this much stuff
sd	Of course we got it on, a little bit of more furniture and stuff,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	for Waco
sd	and especially around Lake Shore area, that area's picked up quite a bit since we were there,
aa	Yeah,
sd	the ones next door to those,
aa	Yeah
sd	And we lived in those third ones
sd(^q)	we drive by now and think, gosh, you know, look how much it's changed
sd	every now and then,
aa	yeah,
sd	We used to run to you know, Red Lobster
sd	we don't have to run that far .
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	And it's nice too.
sd	I liked living there.
sv	I guess we chewed up the house market, and apartment market for a while.
fc	You too, Tanya.
fc	All right.
fc	Bye, bye.
sd	Well, I primarily listen to classical music when I have my druthers, partly because I find it more soothing.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I tend to listen to the classical music, on the radio a lot.
qy	are you involved in music?
sd	Well, my whole family is somewhat musical, and not from training, but just because we sing in our choir
ar	No,
sv	It's loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning.
sd	but, the more popular music I don't care for, usually.
sd	even when I was a teenager I didn't really like the music of that period so much because I found I liked, a little bit more melodious music than what was often the popular, rock and roll kind of sound.
sd	Although now I kind of enjoy hearing the rock and roll, I guess it makes me think I'm young again .
bh	Isn't that the truth?
sd	And, you don't hear everything all the time,
sd	and I remember my older sister.
sd	and she laughed
aa	Right,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes,
sd	the problem that I found, in this area is that there, there is inconsistency in the quality here.
sd	If you get someone who's very good at selecting, it's okay,
sd	I live in the, Washington, D C area, Maryland.
b	Yes.
aa	Uh huh,
sd	But, now my children have sometimes,
ba	wow.
b	Right.
ba	That's nice,
ba	Well, wonderful.
sv	That'll be a musician.
sv	there's some wonderful Christian, children's tapes. you can get,
sd	and I know when my children were younger, we found a lot of really nice tapes that they liked.
sd	my youngest is almost sixteen.
sd	there's one that's, a little girl singing Practice Makes Perfect.
sd	And, she's playing the piano.
sd	And so she gets the wrong note every now and then.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	Because I have always played classical music, or classical style,
sd	Someone else noticed it
sd(^q)	and I said, well, I guess that's true.
sd	you know, it was really funny .
aa	Right,
sd	this same child, really listened to more, ballady or, pleasant sort of songs and even classical, rather than the real hard rock stuff that so many other kids listen to.
sd	And I never, I didn't want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and wouldn't do it anymore .
aa	Right .
b	Yeah.
fc	Well, it was nice talking to you,
fc	Bye bye.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah,
sd	Well, my graduate work is in speech pathology,
ny	Yeah,
sd	it's difficult for many families, especially in the case of Alzheimer's and, some of the more degenerative diseases to, say, to have them at home, because then the family becomes completely,
aa	exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	Possibly before.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Huh uh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I agree.
sd	Well, I have two children,
sd	so I do not have a whole lot of spare time right now.
sd	I really enjoy,
sd	And then I really enjoy sewing,
b	Uh huh.
aa	I, know it.
b^m	Part time.
aa	Right.
qy	Is this going to be your first?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Right.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	So, I am,
sd	On the weekends I drive around, look to see, you know, who is selling what.
sd	and I got them for two dollars .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	I am glad,
sd	Well, at first, when you first have a baby, seems to take every moment of your time. Partly because you are not used to, you know, juggling your time around like that.
sd	But I think, my husband is real into sports too.
sd	But the kids enjoy going because there's usually a lot of other kids for them to play with
aa	Yeah.
sd	We have never done that before,
aa	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sv	So, I think that will be a lot of fun.
sd	So we are looking forward to that.
sd	Well, when I got married, I thought it was going to be fun .
sd	But my husband and I both, I think, consider it a chore.
sd	our yard has had so many problems.
sd	And, we have had to start all over trying to plant grass.
qy	Do you and your husband like to work in the yard?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sd	So, I enjoy, you know, cooking things to take over to her house
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sv^r	It sure does.
qy	Well, do you guys go camping or anything like that?
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sd	They can go fishing.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd(^q)	And I am saying, no, no .
aa	Yeah.
ng	Well, not really right now.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	It has been so long since I did it that
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	It was a real pretty rug.
sd	And then it was just like I forgot all about it.
sd	And every once in a while I will be digging through the closet,
sd	But, for a while there latch hook rugs were a real big, hobby.
sv	It seemed like people did them a lot.
sd	people do not do that much any more.
b	Yeah.
fc	Yeah.
ft	thank you.
fc	Bye bye.
b	Yes.
ny	yes,
sd	its an Emerson eighty eighty six, two low density floppy drives, and no hard drive yet.
ny	yeah,
sd	it came with a menus program,
sd	and hopefully sometime this spring we'll be able to get one and get it configured.
sd	Eighty eighty six.
qw	Which,
sd	impoverished college student.
sd	This one went on a credit card,
b^m	E D P.
bk	Okay,
b	Yes.
sd	 Computer engineering.
sd	Well, computer engineering technology, which, all I can understand is it's a slightly more hands on version of computer engineering.
aa	yes.
ny	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
sd	I've not had a chance to work with it, although, my, data structures teacher was telling us something about how fuzzy logic works as far as the concept behind it.
sd	Now how you'd implement that software wise or mechanically I don't know,
b	Yes.
qy	In the fuzzy logic direction?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ny	yeah,
qw	Well what do you think about the idea of, kids having to do public service work for a year?
aa	Yes,
aa	That's true.
b	Yeah.
aa	I agree with you.
aa	They are
aa	Yeah,
aa	no.
sd	senior.
sv	once they get into junior high it just, not done anymore .
b	Uh huh.
^2	Me .
sd	Grab,
b	Yeah
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sv	But, since there is much that needs to be done here.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
fc	You, too.
fc	Bye bye.
b	Okay.
sv	Evidently, that's a big problem.
b	Right.
b	Lord, I mean, yeah,
b	right.
aa	Exactly,
aa	That's right,
sv	what gets me is I can't believe that or, our state legislature can't come up with, some kind of workable means to have funds for the school.
nn	No,
b	Okay.
b	Okay,
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	Exactly.
aa	Exactly.
aa	Right,
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
sd	but, I can definitely, see on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern.
b	yeah,
sv	and I don't think any politician's going to do that,
b	Right.
aa	Exactly.
b	Yeah
b	Well yeah,
b	right.
aa	Exactly,
sv	and you want to encourage them, you know, to be active and everything in school,
b	Okay.
na	Right.
aa	That's right,
aa	yeah, that is a scary thought,
b	Right.
aa	Exactly.
aa	That's right.
b	Right.
aa	That's true,
b	Right.
sv	that's where they get the deep rooted values
sv	Then you just have to hope and pray that everything, works out okay,
fc	Okay,
fc	You to.
aa	Me, too.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	really.
ng	We don't get Channel Two.
sd	I wish we got that what,
qy	Was it?
bh	really?
sd	actually, I did,
sd	and, so, I, I appreciate his too, his mus ,
qy^g	he, he's from Ireland isn't he?
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	so, I've played flute, flute and piano,
sd	I'm getting now to the age where I don't like the new stuff that's coming an , much of the new stuff that's coming out,
sd	my husband says I'm getting old .
bh	Do you?
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
sd	I could never do that .
b	Yeah,
sd	I haven't done that in a long time.
^h	So, let's see
sv	that's not music ,
sv	that is not,
sv	Well, it's, it's not, it's not music,
sv	it doesn't, it doesn't give you relaxation,
sv	you can't dance to it,
b	Yeah.
bh	Have you?
bh	Are they?
bh	really?
sd	I've heard, I've heard that that is a really,
qy^d	I heard that was hard to get tickets to.
b	Yeah.
ba	I bet it was,
ba^r	I really bet it was .
b	Yeah.
bh	Was it?
sd	I know who you're talking about,
sd	she's got black hair,
b	Yeah,
sd	the last country music,
sd	and they like, they like the Oak Ridge Boys and the Statler Brothers,
sd	and, well, my, my, my parents,
aa	yeah,
b^m	and, yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sv	I get kind, of tire , get tired of every other song being Alabama on the, radio.
sd	I've never cared for Hank, Williams, Junior.
b	Oh .
sd	I just never have.
bh	is it?
bk	Okay,
b	Yeah.
sd	I've heard the name.
sd	I've never seen a Gene Autry movie,
o	No,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
ba	that's neat.
sv	that would be great if they weren't too worn out, at the time.
qy	Is there not?
aa	Well, that's true.
ba	Well, that's a shame
sv	you'd, think there'd be a market for,
sv	I'm sure you could find old players for them
b	Oh.
aa	No.
sv	You could kill somebody with them .
sv	And the ones you buy,
sv	and they're not meant to last, at all,
sv	neither are tapes.
sd	and machines will eat them,
sv	and so, the best bet, anymo , these days are compact disk,
b	no.
^2	Radio.
sv	I think it was better back then to,
sv	and the radio is, you know, more exciting, really, than television,
sv	it just didn't vegetate your mind like television does .
b	yeah.
qy	Was it on the radio every week?
qw	what day, what day was that on,
^h	Well, it's hard to say.
b	Uh huh.
nn	No,
qo	How about you?
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah.
sd	they've been getting cleaner.
na	Sure.
sd	I mean the stuff I've read recently in Technology Review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit, overstated. That a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all.
sd	I haven't read that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
nd	Well, that's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article.
na	They didn't say what,
aa	Yeah,
h	But, I don't know,
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think it's up to individuals too, to ask automakers for, for less pollutant vehicles.
b	Yeah.
sv	and the new cars is, hardly anything.
b	Yeah,
b	Right.
sv	I mean, they do generate a lot of soot
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
qw	Well, what do you think about like a device, a meter right on a tail pipe
sd	Well, it just means if you don't pollute, right, or you pollute very little you don't have to pay any tax
ny	Yeah,
b	Right.
sv	but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
fp	I'm doing fine.
bk	Okay.
aa	Yeah,
nn	No.
sd	Well, I live in an apartment building
sd	I'd love to have a dog, you know.
qw	What is she?
b	Ah.
b	Yeah.
aa	for sure.
b	Yes,
sd	But, it, it's it's really made such a difference for her.
sd	so I'm unable to, really take care of a pet
b	yeah.
sd	it's just a great cat,
sv	Well, you don't own cats.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I could just walk in the door
sv	It was, uncanny .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Sure .
bh	Really?
sd	well, I had that cat that I mentioned, Alfie .
sd	and, the next morning, when my roommate got up and, did not feed it right away, it decided that it was going to protest.
sd	Alfie did.
ba,fe	Ouch.
ba	Well, that's great,
aa	Yeah.
b	Really.
ba	My goodness.
sv	Well, that, that, that will make their day.
bf	Only work initially.
sv	For cats anyway, you know.
fc	And you take care.
fc	Maybe we'll talk again sometimes .
sd	That's my buzzer at the door .
fc	Okay.
fc	Thank you .
b	No,
b	Yeah.
sd	I don't know about the young women,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I bet.
b^m	Yeah,
sd	He came from a poor immigrant family,
sd	and he did.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's pretty good.
ba	That's good.
b	Yeah,
sd	I mean, working in the national parks, working, clean up the roadsides
sv	I mean, I've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend * why no slash? not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job, but at least some of their time to go out and clean up the roads. You know,
b	Yeah.
sv	Country would benefit,
bh	That right.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	What I hear one time, I think it was on Paul Harvey's, radio segment, that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy, each person would receive like forty five thousand dollars.
sv	I mean, I was astounded.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
bh	Is that right,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	It's sad.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
^2	Educational or vocational training or something.
sv	And they'll help the country eventually, too, because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people,
sv	and that's only going to help.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
bf	As opposed to what we were twenty years ago.
b	Yeah
sv	because they have the ambition, I guess.
b	Yeah,
sv	I think that if, young people had service to the country might give them more ambition. Because they learn that serving other people is a good thing.
b	Yeah,
ad	Give me the money
b	Yeah.
aa	No.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd(^q)	And when come time to get out of school, I thought, Boy, I'd like to teach.
sd	You know, I don't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life.
sv	I mean, that's a sad thing to think,
aa	Yeah,
sv	That's wrong.
sd	I'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less,
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Yeah
sd	But, you know, when it gets right down to it,
ba	That's pretty good.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
^2	And they served a good function.
sd	I remember, the company my dad worked for, the people there went on strike against the management.
sd	and they all lost their jobs.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
sv	And they're trying to do that now with the imports.
sv	It'll be a tough road, though.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	It teaches them pride in their country.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah,
sv	And that's a great idea.
b	Uh huh.
h	well, I don't actually live in the city,
b	Uh huh.
sd	where I live now it's not so bad.
sd	I live out in the country,
sd	I'm about fifteen miles out.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
qy	are there any theories on why this is happening?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	So they're professionals?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
qw	Well, what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qy	So you think that would be a deterrent?
b	Uh huh.
qw	Well, what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty?
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ba	wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	did you sue him under the civil system?
qy^r	Did you sue him under the civil system?
sv	Well, you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something, right, and try to get money from him
b	Yeah.
sd	But they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh,
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
ba	That's awful .
sv	Gives you sympathy for the vigilantes.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my God.
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And that's a deterrent, too. If you think the home owner might be armed, right, and awake
sd	here you break in,
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
ba	Wow,
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	And I think one of the big things that you can do to increase deterrence is, if someone is found guilty of a, felony level offense, they lose their citizenship.
sv	and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about, you know, protecting these people from, we just don't protect them.
aa	I know,
ny	Yes,
sd	And then since then we have painted the bedroom.
ny	Yeah,
bk^m	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
br^m	How do you get the edge?
sd	You just have to be real careful.
sd	We use, a two inch brush on a slant
sd	and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes.
ny	Well, yeah.
ny	Yeah,
sd	There are three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses.
sd	So, I am thinking I am going to change it to, something, you know,
o@	I think I am going to put something like a brown on it, on the outside. And maybe, a little deeper brown in the entry way or something so it will stand out a little. What color did you paint,
b	Yeah.
qw	What color did you paint your house?
bf	On the out,
ad	Well, you have got to get one of those ladders.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, our house in New Mexico, it was stucco,
sd	And we did basically seventy five percent of the house
sd	So, I hired this man to come in and do it. A young kid.
sd	And he came with his own raf ,
nn	No,
b	Yeah.
sd	He came and did it that way
sd	and if he fell, he was dead
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qw	How much did it cost you for the paint for the outside?
bk	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and yet he bought like seventeen gallons.
sd	And, anyway, when he checked out and he was using his charge card too. They only charged him for one gallon of paint. Like thirteen bucks or something.
sd	And he had, the, he had already carried a ladder outside and told her that
sd	and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint
sd	so she had to start all over again
sd	and when he got outside, he noticed his receipt was like thirteen ninety nine or something.
sd	And he saw .
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	Rollers are so messy.
ny	Yes,
b^m	Off and on
sd	I'd say more on than off .
sd	I do walking on the treadmill,
ng	not really.
ny	Yeah,
b	yeah.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	I use to have one,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Oh.
qy	Have you ever had any injuries from jogging?
sd	I guess it worries me about jogging that I hear that it's very hard on your body and that, you know, you can end up getting hurt, worse.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, I guess my breakdown they say about every six months.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	well.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Are you going to do that?
sv	Well, that sounds like something good to do then.
b	Yeah,
sd	Well, I do,
^h	Well, I'm trying to get my tolerance now
sd	but I'm trying to workup to three miles.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	My walkman broke,
sd	so I'm upset ,
aa	Yeah,
nn	No,
sd	I have a cassette.
sd	I use tapes.
sd	or Richard Simmons,
bf	Sweating to the oldies .
b	Uh huh.
sd	There was one guy I use to watch on E S P N,
sd	I use to watch one on the air,
b	yeah.
b	Yeah,
bh	Do they.
sd	I'll have to tune in.
sd	I'll have to check it, check, check, check it back up,
sv	but the thing is everybody always looks so good on that show, at least on .
sv	Not everybody has a picture perfect body.
sd	I haven't watch any other ones on T V. Just on some of the tapes.
b	Okay,
sv	Now, that's a thought.
fc	Nice talking to you too.
fc	Talk to you later.
fc	Bye.
sv	Well, I think, down here in Texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns.
sd	An , you know, I do like to have my guns.
sd	But, I like to have them handy.
sd	I've never heard of anything like that.
sv	That would be nice.
b	Yeah
aa	I know
sd	and, we bought it there.
sd	About nine days.
aa	No.
sv	somebody wants to do that,
sv	A shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does.
aa	No,
sd	you have a little, thing bottom of th , on top of the barrel where you turn it,
sd	you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get.
sd	And the spread changes.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	He belonged to one awhile back.
sd	and, we can't even find a place to shoot. Just for target practice.
sd	I'd love to get used to that shotgun.
b	Yeah.
sd	but, you know, they used speed and accuracy and all that.
ba	That's a good,
b	Yeah.
sd	well we was living on a navy base down in Memphis
sd	Well, he went tumbling down the steps along with, shooting his foot almost off.
sd	I can't remember what the term was going around.
h	that's a hard one because we did that.
no	I have no idea.
ny	Yeah.
sv	I don't think you have to register a shotgun .
sd	Well, see, my husband has a thing.
sd	my kid is jumping on me.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sv	bu , you know, they know so, how much money you make a week to, probably your,
aa	Yeah.
ar	No,
sd	And, we're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about.
nn	No.
b	Yeah.
sd	a ho , it's a, it's a bargain thing.
sd	It comes out every Tuesday.
nn	No.
ny	Yeah.
sv	You know. And I'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun.
sd	we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have.
b	Yeah,
bk	Uh huh.
sv	That's pretty impressive.
sd	I guess a play softball one night a week.
ny	Yeah,
sd	it, it varies.
sd	about forty five, fifty minutes.
b	Yeah,
sd	but, it's enough of a pain, that I did it consistently one year,
sd	It was a big hunk of the day .
ng	Not so much.
qo	How about you,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Are you think of doing any, like, centuries, or ...
b	Uh huh.
sv	I mean people seem to get into different aspects.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
ba	that's nice.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	So it makes biking a better alternative for transportation.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's terrific.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I guess as an adult for just about the past, three years or so .
b	And, yeah,
nn	No,
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's great.
b	Yeah,
sd	You know, it gets it down to about forty.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
sd	On average,
nn	No,
sd	And, I don't do that.
sd	but, you know, up here , it's only stopped snowing since then.
sv	it's, it's, it's pretty good.
aa	yeah,
sd	University of Rochester.
sv	So it's fairly picturesque.
sd	so it's, it's a good ride
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
fc	it was good talking to you.
fc	Okay,
fc	Bye.
sd	well, I'm not an expert,
sv	that's another arguable issue
qy	Well, did you see Carl Sagan on SIXTY MINUTES when he was talking about if the, if the war started in Kuwait and they'd set those, all th ,
sd	it was, it was interesting
ny	Yes.
b	yes,
sd	but th , th , the, the com , the general, the opinion among the, meteorologists at,
ny	Yeah,
sd	But I, I did that in my .
ng	No, I'm a production planner.
sd	But I, I'm in the active reserves as a weatherman,
sd	I keep up from time to time,
sd	and if there isn't and we do some the right things, I think,
qy	Well, do you have an older car?
sd	I have been working on an older car
sd	Well, I'm restoring one.
sd	I'm not having any problem it's a seventy.
qy	But did you have another ques ,
nn	No,
sd	they called nuclear winner
sd	Well, the Chernobyl accident,
sv	but when you get up in the morning in Dallas and see all that haze from west Texas, is that pollution?
 %	Well, it,
qh	But who wants to, ride a bus?
sd	Well, my boss drives forty miles one way each day.
sd	And one of the guys that works with me drives forty five miles.
sd	and they don't think it,
sd	so, we all move out out of downtown
sd	And now the valley is not
aa@	Yes, yes. Well, do ...
 +	General Motors apparently has one that they're testing,
sd	But they suppose,
sd	Well, the ROAD and TRACK was talking about that apparently General Motors has some,
sd	Well, there's still a lot of research,
b	Yeah.
sd	I'm at ,
sd	well, I'm in the C building,
sd	I know the focal plain array is they were taking space a long time.
sv	Well, the problem is that gas at a dollar a gallon, you know, who wants to,
sd	Well, I thought I saw an ad for Volkswagen that had an alcohol,
sd	they had one with spots on it and something.
sd	an article.
nn	No,
sd	I didn't go,
sd	They've done a lot.
sv	and it sure sounds like that's going to be a really viable program if it continues to be funded at current levels.
 sv	they're going to be doing a lot of interesting things.
sv	So, you know, there's there's a big opportunity for us to explore, what sorts of things you can do in a zero gravity environment.
sv	So. I suspect that we'll see a lot of gains from that.
sd	Well, as far as the practical aspects go, I suspect that the space station may actually be a good compromise between, you know, , I'm sorry, deep space exploration and not doing anything because we have the opportunity to off load some things to the space station.
sd	And, you know, perhaps we can find better techniques for doing things that, we'd normally do down here that are damaging to the environment.
 ny	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	I can start.
sv	I think one of the biggest, improvements in women is that finally you're starting to see them get into, management
sv	and you're seeing them, get, elected to, political offices.
 +	not near enough.
sv	You're not seeing, you know,
sd	And I have a sister that's an attorney in Oklahoma City,
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh,
b	Right,
sv	it was, then it was almost like a put down, particularly even by women in the work force.
sv	And it's getting the respect which is about time.
aa	Yes,
ba	That's right.
b	Right.
aa	Yes .
sd	Because I know I stayed home with mine and didn't start working until mine were in high school.
 sd	so, you know, it kind of does me good.
 +	so involved with families.
sv	Which, again, I think helps a woman's role.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I had to,
sd	and so I would work
sd	I was absolutely exhausted.
sv	and these women that are waiting until they're in their late thirties, or early forties to have their first children, I think are absolutely crazy.
b	Uh huh.
h	I don't really know what to think about it,
qy	Have you noticed that?
b	Uh huh,
sv	But I think trial by jury it's a lot better than leaving it up to one person.
qy^d	Leaving it up to the judge?
bk	okay.
b	Yeah,
sv	Course the judge will know when he'll be up for parole and all that.
b	Okay,
b	Uh huh.
sd	But, I don't know,
b	Right,
b	Yeah.
b	Right
qy	Does it have to be unanimous?
sv	Well then they consider it a hung jury, I think
b	Uh huh.
b	No,
sv	Well you don't have to be really convinced that he's guilty,
 b	Yeah.
sd@	I would hate to be that person because you would be, you know, bombarded by all the other eleven jurors to, you know, just say he's guilty so we can get out of here and go
sd@	home. * should this be in the above slash unit? The slash unit should end here. Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
t3	Kyle, I'm talking,
sd	Well I just think it's weird because I've saw, well, of course, soap operas,
sd	This one guy had, framed himself to make it,
b	Yeah,
nn	No,
qy^d	about that woman.
b	Right,
sv	I'm sure the prosecuting attorney could make a real good case if he, you know, knew all the details of the defendant's, you know, case.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	Well that one does seem out of it, though, because it, we , you're allowed to show their character,
sv	And if it shows that their character's, you know, capable of lesser thoughts like that and stuff.
b	Right,
sv	Tell you what we need to do is go into law and then we'll be able to,
ny	Yeah,
bk	Okay,
sv	Putting the right people in the office, that's a lot to do with it too.
sv	a lot of the politics will pass laws and stuff that the, general public wants,
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
b	Right.
 b	Uh huh,
qy	Well did they have a T V movie about him?
qw	Well, well, how was he killing the women.
qy	Were they jogging on a,
bk	okay.
sd	see, that's what I mean,
sd	I think my sister is married to a guy from Rochester.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well of course.
sv	But they just need to do something with him.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, it's supposed to be a jury of your peers,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
bh	did you?
qw	Where did you go?
bf^m	Clarion.
 qy	I mean, if you had children, would you want them to go to a certain place
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
 %	But, you know, I know,
h	I do not know,
 %	But,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
 b	Yeah.
 b	Uh huh.
 bf	For business.
qy	So, are you working somewhere then
bk	I see,
bh	are you?
qy	Do you have friends there
 bk	I see.
b	So, yeah,
sd	But I am originally from Illinois, but, you know, I have gone to college, I guess a few different places,
sd(^q)	and I will say, here's what you have got,
 sd	I put my wife through school too.
 %	You know, you,
 b	Right.
 b	Yeah.
 b	Right.
 b	Uh huh,
 b	Right.
sd	you know, so I think that helped me be real serious about it.
 +	and, you know, a family and everything else,
 b	Uh huh.
 b	Yeah.
 b	Uh huh.
 +	for,
sd	But, you know, by then she had practically got her degree,
ny	Yes, sir,
 sd	Well, actually I've done both kinds
 +	catch a lot of things in the ocean there.
 sd	I moved here to State College, in nineteen fifty five
 sd	The trout fishing is really, beautiful.
 +	so that I can then find out the type of lures that they use and where they fish, and any unique, techniques that would help you.
na	no,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
na	That sounds about right
ny	uh huh,
sd	Well, as I say, it's been several years,
 b	Uh huh.
sd	I just have one son and he lives out of the state now, rather, in the eastern corner of it,
bh	is that right?
ba	my goodness.
 sd	Well, I, the disease I caught was simply because, I was in the Norfolk Portsmouth area,
sd	there's so much water around that, you're either boating or you're fishing
 sd	and, I fairly enjoyed at that time.
sd	when I go on one of the large lakes that we have here I enjoy fishing for trout from that,
sd	Well, as I say, I'm in Center County.
sv	Now these aren't huge lakes from your point of view
 sd	but they are probably fifteen, twenty acres maybe
 +	which here is a lot of water,
sd	Well, you know they actually started
sd	either computer paper or different types of paper.
sd	I've had some ideas on how I think they could probably do it a little less expensively and accomplish the same purpose,
sd	Well, you know, they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module, or down the hall
sd	You know, where I use to work we had what we called tree boxes.
sd	And they were recycled cardboard.
b	Right.
b	Right,
sd	and whereas if you had a box that pretty soon it got full, you close the box, it's already bundled, it's already done for you.
sv	So you're saving a lot of time and effort.
qo	So, what else do they do in the Dallas area?
b	Uh huh.
^2	Anything extra.
ba	That sounds good.
sd	so I've not done that,
^2	Find a place.
sd	I don't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans.
sv	I think they can do the plastics, like the liter bottles things like that.
h	but, I don't know.
sd	I do that
sd	you drive through Burger King now and the bags are recycled paper
sv	you know, so, you know I feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it.
ng	I'm not as good about searching something out like that
sd	but if I am there and the choice is there I would probably take the recycled product.
sv	So, you know, that's just where I probably need to be a little more responsible, citizen wise, you know, looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start packaging it that way.
sd	So, you know, they are getting away from the styrofoam,
o	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
ba	gosh.
qw	And how long have you had them?
b@	Yes. Kind of lose track .
sv	Well, that's interesting because we have a simi ,
 sd	and she is going to be thirteen this summer
ny@	Yes, uh huh.
sd	she's, a mix of Cock , Cocker Spaniel and Poodle.
qy	Is that right?
bh	Isn't that interesting ?
sd	well, ours is black,
sd	definitely different .
b	Yes,
sd	and, she's slowing down considerably.
 sd	she doesn't see very well
 b	Yeah,
sd	at this age, I guess so.
sd	But, she's been a good dog to have,
b	Yeah,
aa	I agree,
b	Uh huh.
 ba	My goodness.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Isn't that,
 +	then we went out then, and found one,
sd	and, she was so cute because all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy.
sd	and I thought, that's the dog for me .
b	Yeah,
sd	and, she just loved this little dog,
 +	to pieces
sd	Our son, on the other hand, who was about eleven at the time, was, not very interested in pets,
sv	So you just never know how that works out .
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
b	yes,
ba	dear .
b	Yes,
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
qy	Is that right?
bh	Isn't that amazing?
b	Uh huh,
sd	I mean, that made me think of, when our daughter was looking at colleges, we visited a campus in, Saint Louis
 +	and, the,
 +	I'm sure someone, you know, fed them.
sd	But, our guide that day said that , one woman many, many years ago had given a huge sum of money to the university, on the condition that there be, dogs just kind of left to roam around the campus. Which is the strangest thing I had ever heard .
b	I know.
aa	Yes,
aa	Yes,
sv	and it kind of made it seem more homey too .
sv	I thought that was most unique.
 %	but, I,
sd	and so they were never allowed in the house, you know,
sd	they were always kind of,
b	Yeah,
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
ba	my golly.
ba	gosh.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
ba	I'll be darned.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Isn't that interesting?
ba	Goodness sake.
ba	my gosh.
b	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	My goodness.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I'll be.
 ba	My goodness.
ba	That's in ,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	Is that right?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	I have a few, you know, favorite shows that I try not to miss.
sd	L A LAW is one of them.
sd	Although this year's, it's a little easier to miss than last year. With the new cast and everything.
b	Right,
sd	THE TRIALS OF ROSIE O'NEILL with Sharon Gless.
sv	It's very good.
sd	But, and then there's a new sitcom on that is, Tim Allen's, what is it, HANDYMAN.
qy^g	It's hysterical, isn't it?
qy	Did you catch the Christmas? .
sv	I thought it was, you know,
qy	Did you see the end of it?
qy^d	Well, you know, the little boy, the little one was trying to decide if there was a Santa Claus.
sd^m	They thought it was the neighbor.
sv	I thought that was wonderful.
sd	And, used to be on Sunday nights, now I can't figure out where they've moved it.
sd	And it showed the latest, developments from all the computer companies.
sv	unless you're really into computers, and software, you probably wouldn't be interested,
h	but
 +	I don't know,
sd	And, you know, they covered everything from entertainment to spreadsheets, you know, and then also, the hardware.
sd	So you could see what the new developments were and what to look for
sd	It was just a thirty minute show with no commercials.
sd	public television, course, doesn't have the commercials during the show
sd	And I like the FRUGAL GOURMET.
sd	Well, there's very few that, you know, my life would stop if I didn't catch.
sd	Well, I watch two,
sd	And that's the BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL and AS THE WORLD TURNS.
sd	And I've watched the, AS THE WORLD TURNS since I was a little girl .
sd	it's, something I've done for the last probably twenty five years.
ny	Yes,
sd	But I like every, I like {F uh, the information shows
sd	I subscribe to H B O.
sd	So I can get some of the movies.
aa	It is.
sd	and you don't get good reception without cable
 sd	so
 +	that's primarily why I have it right now.
sd^t	I've originated only a few.
sd^t	But I've received quite a few.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd^t	you pushed the record button.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I'm quite pleased with it.
b	Uh huh.
b	yes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Now I really got caught up back in eighty five,
 +	exploration.
nn	No,
sd	But I say, I wasn't connected with G S I.
sd	And, I got caught up in a layoff.
sd	but, what T I did for us is, I've never heard of it before. They fixed us up with an office with, telephones, access to long distance, computers, a secretary to take messages for us or type, letters, for us.
sd	they had out of town newspapers
br	I beg your pardon.
ny	yes.
sd	course that was not, restricted just to just us.
 sd	But the most important thing was that, they had made up the difference between, unemployment pay and seventy five percent of my net pay.
sd	So, I was able to, not just exist.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, this was not a learning thing by any means.
b	Oh.
sd	Well, course I went through this, what, about five years ago.
sd	Well, that's one of those little extras that you don't see in the, the, the handbook, you know.
 sd	I'm getting close to retirement.
sd	And, of course I've been looking into it but, since I'm only a yellow badger, I won't be getting a whole heck of a lot from T I, as far as retirement is concerned.
sd	I've never heard of such a thing.
b	Uh huh.
sd	that sounds like a hell of an idea.
b	Yes,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Course, that's, something like an I R A
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, knock wood,
sd	And I like that, a lot better than AETNA
b	Uh huh.
qy	Well, doesn't it work, you don't see, anything until you spend the minimum?
b	Yeah.
 b	Uh huh.
sd	that one I haven't heard about.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
ft	Well thanks,
ft	thanks for the tip, Jim.
sd	I shall look into it.
aa	Yeah
sd	retirement.
b	Uh huh.
qo	What about vacation?
b	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I won't be around that long.
bh	really?
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
nn	No.
bk	okay.
sv	So you're starting from the baseline.
b	I see .
b	Right.
sd	Well, he's now eighteen. And in, you know, has completed a couple of years of university.
b	right.
sd	But I was very lucky because I was a college professor.
sd	And so I was able to, you know,
 +	my apartment.
sd	And I left him in a carry cot when he was very little .
sd	Because I was gone only an hour at a stretch or an hour and a half.
sd	And I was able to, you know, get, his schedule just, cooperated.
b	Yeah.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm in Maryland.
sd	but I was out of the country when, my son was little.
sd	and then later on when he was, you know
sd	we're talking about, I went back to work or taught some classes like a week after he was born.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	But then later what I did was I brought a woman into the house.
sd	And she was supposed to help me a little bit with cooking and doing the baby's laundry and this sort of stuff.
sd	And then, I also came home and sort of was able to see from a distance what she was doing.
sd	And, you know, in a sense she carried him around a lot, too much. you know for my taste.
sv(^q)	It was constantly, no, I don't want him, to explore anything.
na	I think it worked out very, very well.
sd	And he had asked for a paper and, you know, sort of scribble
sd	and there were active times.
b	Oh.
qr	Did you say Romania or Armenia?
bk	okay.
ba	good.
ba	great.
bd	that's silly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	I mean your kids need you .
ar	No,
b	Right,
b	yeah.
ar	No,
sd	And, I mean, that was recently after my son, was going off.
sv	I think we're too much towards it's somebody problem, you know.
^q	I want to work.
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
ba@	And that's sad. Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	and as long as one can supervise it and, you know, make it work into one's own schedule without it seeming like dumping or or, or, giving it, you know, the whole job to somebody else to take care of.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
 sv	there are several, u , m , mothers who stay home.
sv	it's probably not completely legal .
sd	But, and they take care of another child
sv	And I mean that's another possibility
b	Yeah,
nn	No.
sd	But then he actually started kindergarten at age three.
sd	And so, and you know, it wasn't like prekindergarten,
aa	Yeah.
ny	But, yeah,
sd	and also there aren't that many women who d , who work.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
nd	Well, no
b	Okay,
sd	Well, we just ate out, had a big lunch actually because we both have been working late
ny	Yeah.
sv	Then this will probably,
sv	That sounds terrible to tell you to go somewhere where it's not that great
sd	but my, softball unit here is acting like he's dying of tramane poison .
sd	which I'm not Italian,
sv	So it wasn't too bad it really wasn't
qy	but do you have any favorite?
ny	yes,
ba	you're kidding.
ba	sure.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	six thirty five?
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah,
sd	We went there on my birthday in March it's great.
^2	too much like a bar naturally, and Mexico,
aa	yeah,
 sv	The food is probably,
sd	I'm not a I'm Mexican food gourmet by any means
sd	the shredded beef the type of, spices or sauces they use.
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've never had anything there that wasn't delicious.
 sd	Even though you have to stand in line and all of that, that's the only thing I don't like about it too
sd	Even though we don't have kids we've been married long enough to, not be around that.
^h	I'm trying to think of what else we like to eat.
sd	I mean lunch today was eighteen dollars.
b	Yeah,
sd^t	I'm glad I'm talking about food normally these conversations are ,
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	I don't like it at all usually
b	Yeah,
sd	and I remember when we went , we were married with another couple that was just dating
sd	It made all raw fish tastes great .
sd	and the girls wear kimonos and,
 +	You know, if you're ever looking for that.
t1	but what other kind of foods,
ny	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
qy	have you ever been to I think it's called Spring Creek Barbecue?
 sd	That's real good,
sd	my husband's going upstairs,
sd	I didn't know they had that.
sd	I can't talk I had chocolate bavarian tort, for desert, today, which I never eat at lunch
sd	and it was wonderful.
aa	It was,
sd	in fact if I could pick my, restaurants on how their coffee is and how their french bread is and the butter and the desert I would be,
 +	yes, I would be in hog heaven.
 ba	congratulations.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	It's really sad isn't it cause it's hard to get them away from junk then.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
sv	Well, that's all right as long as,
sd	I was going to say because with six people how do you,
b	Yeah,
 b	Yeah,
sd	I think it will be worth it
sv	and I think that that would make them drool any way.
qy	You, know, I guess are you is it a little bit of constricted, because a lot of restaurants don't take,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	That yuppie kind of crowd, yeah.
b	Yeah.
 sd	And that always just bothered me
b	yeah
sd	I mean I was shocked,
b	Yeah,
b	Boy,
 +	cheap to pay the delivery .
 sd	I don't like strange people coming to my door,
b	No,
b	Yeah,
fc	Well, I enjoyed talking to you,
fc	Okay.
fc^m	Bye bye.
aa	Well, it'll be real easy for us,
ny	So, yeah.
ng	We're not vegan vegetarians.
sd	I used to be a complete vegan vegetarian, where I didn't eat any animal products at all.
sd	But, it's really difficult in the area if you don't have, you know, the products that you can get.
b	Yeah.
 sd	But here, basically, you go to an Italian restaurant or you go to a Mexican restaurant, you know, you know, where you have a little bit more variety as far as the pastas or the the corn meal, you know, or something.
b	yeah,
sd	we don't really eat out too much.
sd	we tend to eat at home.
sd	I've been a vegetarian for, two years now.
na	Definitely.
sv	And it makes you more aware of what you're eating.
sv	Because you have to be.
sv	I mean, you k ,
sv	And you're just more aware of food for energy, for energy sake.
sd	Well, that's just it,
sd	And when I was a vegan, it's, you know,
sv	your egg products. If you don't eat any of those,
sv	but actually you can get everything you need through vegetables.
sv	A lot of people don't know that.
sv	Well, the thing is that milk products,
sv	we tend to,
b	Yeah.
sv	So we're,
 +	Whereas when we eat, say broccoli, you utilize all of it.
sv	your body accepts all of the broccoli.
sv	So, it's like, it's like, say, a person using vitamins, as opposed to, vitamin supplements as opposed to eating regular food.
sv	Your body just doesn't accept vitamins and the minerals in the, the vitamins in, supplements that it does in regular food,
sd	But we both feel much healthier, much healthier.
sd	And I couldn't consider going back to eating,
aa	Yeah.
sd	And my husband has changed.
sd	But, now he feels like I do.
sd	And he, you know,
aa	Yeah.
sd	And now we both think a lot of well, what is it we're eating in relation to what it's going to give to our bodies.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And people here buy a half a cow and put it in their freezer,
sd	you know. And that's the way I,
sv	But, you know, I suppose if you really believe in something you adjust your life
sv	because your mind.
 sv	inside yourself it's not right.
ny@	yes. Yeah.
qw	So what do you look for when you,
b	Uh huh.
qr	when you're traveling, do you look for places that's established, that you've been to before or are you willing to try new places?
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	As opposed to like a cafeteria kind of situation?
ar	Well no,
qh	Why not get the whole,
sd	I feel like it's a treat.
ba	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Oh.
bk	I see.
^2	Not a lot of gravy and things like that.
sd	You know, I, I like those too.
sd	I like those too, because, seems like sometimes you order a meal, you order their dinner meal, and it's like they're trying to find out how much you can eat.
 %	or ,
 sv	or like evidently people go in there and they're not satisfied that they'd been given enough and they complain
b	Uh huh.
sd	I mean, I must admit, sometimes I do like a buffet.
sv	And I think that we just tend to eat, overeat.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Maybe it's not too bad.
b	Yeah.
^2	Just for food, it does seem like it.
 b	Yeah.
sd	we like Indian food,
sd	and, I love Italian food,
na	Chinese
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
 %	because,
sd	I mean my husband's great.
sd	It's wonderful, you know,
sd	and, and, so I'm about forty and whatever,
aa	So, yeah.
b	Yeah,
 +	spring chicken, I guess .
 %	Well,
na	I think I'm ready .
aa^h	Well, let's see,
sv	and from my mother's generation to my generation just a very, very wide, it's been a big change.
aa^m	Very much,
 sd	and we didn't really know what the agenda was going to be
sv	and I think, you know, it got off to a really radical,
b	Yeah.
sv	And, to make a change, you know, you have to make a splash.
sd	But, to continue in that vein, I think it got a little bit warped and off the track in several areas,
sv	but I really do think that women have made a contribution
 +	to human beings, I mean to be human and what it's like and have feelings and emotions
sv	and then the women change around them.
sv	I think men are trying.
sv	But they don't have a national organization of men, to, help them out
sv	and what's changing them, though, is the economic situation, where both team, it has to be a team partnership now,
sv	and they both have to work
sv	and they both have to raise the children, if we're going to have any kind of future at all,
sv	and that, I think has been the downfall of the last ten years.
h	I don't know,
sv	and they wanted to compete with men,
sv	and that's wrong.
sv	I think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men
aa	Absolutely,
sd	but I saw the greatest T shirt the other day,
b	Right.
sv	But, I think men and women both have valuable assets to offer
sd	we were made differently, however you come to that conclusion,
sv	we were biologically, physiologically, made differently
b	Right.
 sv	and, you know, just sort of all swooshed into one channel sort of thing,
sv	it's viva la difference , someone said that
sv	and I think that you can truly respect the other person,
b	Yeah.
h	But, I don't know,
sd	but it's still a challenge being in a marriage and trying to figure out those roles
b	Yeah,
sv	you know, the woman doesn't start off at home, raising the kids and goes back into her career, you know, twenty years later.
ba@	You do. Yeah.
qy	Do you have children?
ba	my goodness.
sd	Well, I mean, okay,
ba	my.
ba	how exiting.
fe	I tell you what.
sd	I just love the babies
sd	and since I'm sort of in a medical situation where I can't do that, it's,
ng	Just eight years,
sd	the most important years of my life you know .
aa	Yeah,
sd	so there have been major, major adjustments,
 sd	but that's another story.
sd	But, you know, my husband has really, really filled in the gaps,
sv	I mean if this is the way it had to be, this is the best way, I could possibly do it
sd	and that has a lot to do with his strength and his, just pitching in and his being able to, you know, all, all ego aside, do a lot of things that really,
sd	so, when I say men haven't changed I guess I should look at my own backyard sort, of thing
ba	yeah.
sv	so, I guess , in the end, you know, you each take your own situation and you deal with it the best you can,
sv	they're got a little wobbly and a little shaky there,
sv	I think, we're going to see a generation of kids that, you know, are just going to be a little bit, not very nurturing.
b	Yeah,
sv	It's dangerous for the woman, too, to think that she can do that
 sv	and she doesn't know who she is
aa	Absolutely.
sv	Well, you know, that's really, I think it depends on what part of the country you're in.
sd	I would almost just say that because, you know, down here in the south you know, a woman's role is, a woman's role, sort of thing,
 %	and you know,
sv	and I think that, you know, career women still have a lot of problems here, with the good old boys, here in Texas sort of thing, making career moves
sv	but, you know, in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents, it's just like the way it has been for years. I mean, you know, since the days of the pioneers, around here.
sv	That's the woman's role,
sv	and it's hard for her to, you know, watch her peers be appreciated, I think sometimes,
sd	And I have women that do both
sd	And so I see I little bit of that
sd	and the other gal I wish she could just get out of Dodge, for a while .
^2	Get some peace and quiet.
b	Yeah,
 b	Yeah.
ba	That's true.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
na	Well, I watch in the evening with my kids .
sd	I have four children.
b	Yeah,
sd	my children like to watch SESAME STREET.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	There are shows that I like.
sd	I let my kids watch things like LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE.
sv	And the COSBY SHOW is, kind of unrealistic as a family unless you live in upper class and have money.
sv	I think that sometimes the things they show on there though,
b	Yeah.
sd	And, I watch a show that I like for entertainment.
sd	I watch that show every time,
sd	I like, how he has to help with the people that he becomes. because it is not a show that he just becomes these people and then he lives there for a while and then he is gone.
sv	He has to do something positive to help them.
b	Yeah.
sd	Me too,
b	Uh huh.
nd	No,
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I do not think it is healthy all the time either.
sd	and my kids like to go play with their friends,
sd	I will not let them watch that.
b	Uh huh.
sd	today I watched,
sd	and they show it in slow motion.
sv	And before, in a western or something, in the olden days,
b	Yeah.
 sv	and it was not, not like today.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Too much realism I think, sometimes.
sv	that is a fun show.
sd	I really
 +	like that one.
b	Uh huh.
qr	The cartoon or the,
sv	That has good moral values too.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd(^q)	I get kind of, saying, "I am sorry kids, this is",
sd	And I think it is important that I see what they are watching.
qy	You mean in cable?
 sd	I do not know, because I do not have that.
b	Uh huh.
qy	do they?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I think that is a good show too.
b	Yeah.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I think not even the old one but the new one too.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	d , ,
b	Yeah.
ba	that is not a problem anyway,
sd	but it is fun you know, seeing the show anyway.
nn	No,
sd	Michael Landon.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Yeah.
qw	Now what is that?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I have not seen that.
b	Uh huh.
qw	What channel is it on?
ny	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I will look and see.
qy^d	It is in the morning?
bk	Okay.
sd	Well, we'll look.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I really like,
sd	they sing songs on there
ny	Yeah.
sd	it's called the Christian music station or something like that.
sd	And, I really like that.
sd	I turn that on Sunday mornings.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
aa	Okay.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Ooh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	gosh,
b	Uh huh.
sd	 I'd never thought about that being a cause,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That's kind of the way Dallas is.
sd	it was all cotton fields,
sv	and ours I think is primarily cars, where we don't carpool like we should an airport.
sd	I work in a building,
sd	and I look out toward D F W International,
sv	and I can imagine it's even worse for people living over near the airport.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	But we're paying for it.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And it seems to me that it's already so evident with our children having a lot more respiratory infections than we had growing up you can really see it.
sd	I had a chance to go to Bolivia a couple years ago,
sd	and it amazed me,
bh	No?
bk	Okay.
bk	All right.
bk	Okay.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	He went to Vietnam one man and came back another, not better.
sd	Then, another friend of mine went,
qy^d	he was a Vietnam war veteran.
b	Yeah.
 ba	That is true.
b	Right.
sd	They really do.
sv	I think that, Desert Storm, shows a lot of learning since that time.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	not so, much that I say, I do not want you here.
b	Yeah.
sv	even ten years ago, there were not that many.
sv	A lot of people have complained in the schools.
sv	Not really.
sv	And that is all a result of, of Vietnam.
sd	and it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there.
 sd	And I would be concerned or interested to find out how they are doing now.
qr	You are talking about P O W s or missing in actions?
bf	Native Vietnamese people.
b	Okay.
sd	that had not occurred to me.
sv	That would be an interesting concept.
qy^d	Cambodia?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I think the terrain had a lot to do with the success of Desert Storm as opposed to that in Vietnam.
sd	You know, there is incredible cover in Vietnam.
sd	And you can't find much cover in a sand dune .
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	What world war do you think they found the experience for that?
sv	Part of it is that, part of it is technology.
sv	But when, When you get into trouble like that in a place like Vietnam, you do tend to analyze the problems that you get into,
sv(^q)	and you say, "Never more."
sv	and you overcome those problems,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Sure.
 sv	being entirely different people.
sv	That is a long time to suffer.
b	Uh huh.
ba	yeah,
ba	yeah.
ba	you bet.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And I cannot blame them.
sd	But I sure cannot blame them for being angry.
sd	For the most part, I wish that it had not happened.
sd	But it did.
ba	yeah.
sv	Well, it has been that way for a very, very long time, though.
sd	We were reading about the French struggling with that in southeast Asia.
sd	So, and, and the Asians historically have always had these kinds of wars going on.
sv	there has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world.
h	I do not know,
sv	More so supported them when they got home.
sv	And, I am afraid that they were treated as castaways for the most part.
sd	And I saw the movie, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY,
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I think so.
fc	Uh huh.
fc^m	Bye bye.
na	As little as possible.
sd	so if I do any garden work, it's only when I go home in the Summer.
sd	It's about two hours north of Pittsburgh.
b	Yes.
ny	Yeah,
sd	So, like almost all our vegetables and everything is from the garden.
sd	But we have like a lot,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	You know, I've seen a lot of people that do that.
sd	I've seen, you know, like elderly people that really can't get out too much sometimes.
sd	I have a great aunt that lives in a,
sd	Because she, you know,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
br	Pardon me?
 qy	Are they, well,
sd	but we call them Morning Glories up here.
b	really.

sd	and we're finding out,
no	I'm trying to think offhand
bk	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I wouldn't,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
^2	That doesn't always work.
bh	really?
b	Oh .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
b	I didn't even know that.
ba	wow.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I can't really think of anything that invades my privacy,
sd	I can't stand that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I don't like how they a ,
sd	And, you know, I don't like, I don't ever get anything over the phone because I don't want to give my social security number out.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I never even knew that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bk	okay.
sd	I really, can't think of any that would invade my privacy you know.
nn	No.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
qy^d@	you know, like AIDS and all that stuff? You know, with you know, your sex, you know .
 %	they've gotten a lot with,
nn	No,
nn	No,
sv	you know, I think it's more safety than anything else.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and it's dangerous.
nn	No
sd	I work with them quite a bit though.
b	okay.
sv	Well, I think they're useful,
na	Well I think that, some work places where I've been they set up
sv	without them knowing how to use it properly, it slows them down, more than it helps them accomplish something.
sv	They spend more time messing with the P C than they would actually accomplishing the tasks that they're trying to do if they didn't have a P C at all.
b	Uh huh,
sv	And you have to, you know, be familiar with it,
sv	A lot of times, people know about half of the capabilities of a package that they should know to actually be able to use it properly,
sv	and if they really understood the capabilities of the package they could do that in about, you know, half the time that they spend trying to figure out how to do it without spending the time to learn the package properly.
aa	Right,
sd	so I've seen that as a problem.
sd	And they set it up manually, so that they have all their spacings and formattings and tabs set manually.
sd	And, then when they have to make a change, say they want to insert a paragraph. They got to go through the document and reset all the page breaks manually and rewrite the whole thing instead of having the,
sd	if they had set up the formatting on the system itself, it would do that for them, and save them a lot of time.
nn	no,
ng	Usually it doesn't divide words.
sd	They usually have it space the words in a rather than divide a word.
sd	So, you see, like in a newspaper, they typeset.
sd	if one line is going to be a lot shorter than another line, they just add spaces to that line to make it look long as the rest of the lines.
aa	Right.
sd	And most computers do that.
sd	I've known people that have used a package for five years, you know,
sd	And it would take me maybe two or three minutes looking in the manual to figure out what command it was that caused this to happen.
no	Sometimes it's,
sd	But some of them, are,
sv	Well, I think so.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
na	With P C s they're either I B M or I B M compatible, mostly.
sd	That is you know, the industry standard.
na	probably.
fc	Okay.
fc	Bye bye.
nn	No,
qy	But, are you at T I?
qy^d	So you have to do the random drug testing.
sd	about ten or eleven calls.
b	Right.
b	Oh.
sd	It doesn't bother me.
qy^g	As far as the number of drug users, you mean?
b	Huh.
b	Right.
b	Right,
sd	When I worked for the temporary agency as a permanent person,
sd	And we did have a couple of cases where the person said that they hadn't used anything,
 +	the second time.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
b	really.
qy	Do they have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive,
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	I know some places just fire people on the spot if they come back positive or something.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
ny	So yeah,
sd	But most of the time it's they get into the wrong crowd first,
sv	It's usually not a one time accidental thing, I don't think.
ad	well I'll let you go if you want to go ahead and take that,
b	Yeah,
nn	No
sd	so we're starting.
b	Yeah.
sd	we're really excited about it.
sd	You know, one thing my husband believes is if you suspect your kids are having any kind of problems, he believes you should take your kids in for a random testing, like on a Saturday morning, if they've been out at a party Friday night.
sd	If you're not too sure what's going on, he tells parents all the time, haul them into the doctor's office and get them checked.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh,
b	Right .
ft	well, thanks.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
ny@	Yea. * is this a typo?
aa	No,
nn	No,
b	Right.
ny	Yeah,
sd^t	Well technically we're not supposed to talk about the phone calls while we're on them
fc	It was good talking to you.
fc	Bye.
br	Excuse me.
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	well, I know like what you just said,
sd	they had to make him sit the bench. And actually kicked him off the team because, his, grades, even though they passed Big Ten standings and they passed, you know, N C double A, did not pass, Purdue requirements.
b	Yeah.
sd	so he was treated like all the rest of students, you know.
sd	And so, their very best player,
sv	You know, it's just sad
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	That's what happened to this guy.
aa	Yeah.
sd	I don't either.
b	Yeah.
sd	And I saw Princeton, I think it was, or Harvard play this year.
sd	And it was so funny to watch them play against the other teams,
sd	I don't know if they won very many games.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd@	I'm kind of racist, I guess, when I say, I like to see the white guys do well, you know . Instead of the run and gun all the time. / * should be two slash units.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	There's just so much pressure on the schools, I think to win, though, you know.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Really.
b	Yeah.
ba	It really is.
sd	Purdue.
b	Yeah.
 %	So.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Are you from Dallas area?
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
qy	You heard of, Have you heard of Damon Bailey. The I U white guard that plays.
 sd	Well, last year, when he was in high school, they drew a crowd of like forty one thousand for the state finals, when he played.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
 +	and then give them five minutes to play,
sv	Because they start,
sd	Tarpley,
qy	Tarpley?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, I read everything, I guess,
sd	well, I like all kinds,
b	Uh huh.
sd	the novels, yeah.
ny	Yeah.
qy	you mean the ancient astronauts things?
sd	I have read some of that.
h	I do not really know that they have the answers in those books.
sv	But they are very interesting. that, they have, what they have discovered.
b	Yeah.
qw^d	You are what kind of buff?
bk	okay.
b	yeah.
sd	Well, I am kind of a hobbyist
sd	I am one of those crazy people that reads the directions.
sd	when she ever there is something, I say, well, have you read the directions?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bh	really?
b	yeah.
b	yeah.
sd	But I have not gotten them in years,
sd	They have wonderful photographs and just amazing photographs that they have done.
b	Yeah.
ba	It is.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sd	of course, was it all books and things
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I have only been more interested because of things are doing so bad and everything.
sd	You always look for things with, with this terrible recession that we are in, to see if there is any go ,
ny	yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
b	Yeah.
b	 yeah.
sd	And I do get,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	yeah,
sv	you can page through it in,
sd	I do not read everything on,
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sd	Trump.
sv	Well, I guess because he was so rich, you know.
sd	Well, he had a young girlfriend.
na	Well, that
b	Yeah.
sd@	And his wife seemed to be very smart. And actually running some of his business.
b	yeah.
b	Right,
fc	Right.
ny	Yeah,
sd	I got a nineteen ninety three Cavalier station wagon.
sd	Well, a friend of my father's, he'd driven it all over the country and it runs great.
sd	like, it has a hundred and fifty three thousand.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Right.
b	Uh huh
b	Right.
sd	I didn't really need power windows, but it has power, you know, windows and steering and air conditioning,
ny	Uh huh,
sd	and, he's told me it gets forty two miles to the gallon.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
 %	Crank,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Right.
sd	like you said, anti lock brakes and air bag,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ny	Yes,
sd	because even today it's supposed to get up into the nineties.
b	Uh huh.
fc	Yeah,
fc	Yeah.
fc	Bye bye.
bk	okay,
sd	I'm ready when you are.
aa	Okay.
ny	Yeah,
aa	That's okay.
o	Okay,
bk	okay.
sd	Well then I can tell you that roles have changed.
sv	and they changed quite a bit.
sd	this was my twentieth high school reunion, in Chicago.
sv	you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that.
sd	That's kind of, the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies.
sv	It was sort of just to go protest,
sv	and, just, everybody be damned and live with some one,
 +	social morals were a little bit lacking.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	It did
sd	And in terms of the corporate community, I've seen a big change in terms of men finally being quote, unquote, used to women, who are in, controlling positions, in the corporate hierarchy.
sv	So I think that's good.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
^2	The mainstay,
 ^2	and restructuring, stepfamilies,
 b	Right.
b	yeah.
^h	I'm trying to think of what else.
sd	those were the general issues.
b	Uh huh.
sd	He was ancient,
b	Uh huh.
 ^2	You didn't know what you're going to be missing.
sd	I don't have any either
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh,
b	Right
 sd	I was twenty seven when I got married
sd	He was twenty three when we met
sd	but I didn't have to have male companionship.
 sd	and a lot of the, friends that I had in school at that point, who had gone back and gone to law school, or M B A programs,
 +	which I also had done, you know, they were very sad. it seemed like they were on their second or third around the marriage track.
sv	So, I guess that's a big change in terms of, just, the attachments that women feel like they need to have, the dependency, their self identity is stronger.
b	Yeah.
 b	Right.
b	Okay,
b	No,
sv	nobody talks about it for women except other women and other men.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
 b	Uh huh.
 aa	Yeah,
 sv	and what you'll find is,
sv	but this is probably typical of the women's movement too, is the idea that you're going to be forty tomorrow anyway, if you want to go back to school.
sd	I'm seriously considering going back to school for law.
sd	but it's still is a different application.
sv	And I mean, so when you're saying quick, I think that's probably one thing that your generation coming up after mine, is thinking that, they have to do everyth , you know, sort of, I call it a chewing syndrome.
sv	They have to eat real fast
sv	they have to just go through everything.
sv	And you'll find that probably by the time your twenty eight, thirty, if you haven't slowed down, something will slow you down.
qy	Do you know what I'm saying?
sv	because it's just, you find out that you're really not, smelling the roses,
b	Uh huh.
ba	it is.
ba	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
bd	you're not,
ar	No.
ba	That's true
aa	No,
sv	and, it's just individual choices.
sd	I stopped comparing myself a long time ago to somebody who had,
sd	I mean, he just turned forty,
sd	I mean that's like your mother,
sv	but what you find is you don't compare the woman, because you just get into trouble.
sd	but what I was going to say about mothers is, your mother probably just won't say it,
^q	you went to school,
^q	you can do this,
^q	we couldn't do that then.
b	Uh huh.
bd	And that's normal,
b	Right
b	Yeah.
sd	That's how, I mean, What, I'm right now.
sd	I'm a free lance writer right now.
sd	And then, what I'm doing is working at, an electronics company, for their company newspaper, right now on the side,
sd	and then I'm also,
bh	you are?
sv	Here's what you shoul ,
 qy	Did you go to Baylor by any chance?
bk	okay,
sd	I went to,
sd	my journalism degree is in,
sv	Well, now it's in pretty disastrous shape for sure.
sv	It's only getting worse exponentially it seems.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yep.
b	Yeah.
sv	I mean there was, people at Stanford who were soaking the government, you know, using millions of dollars of research money for the President to buy beach homes or whatever it was.
sv	And I think that maybe more widespread than well, than we'd like to have think.
sd	but then it's something that's hard to enforce too I'm sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's right.
sv	but I'm not sure that that's really that much of the problem.
sd	I mean when you look at something like the Gulf War it cost us God knows how much. You know, at a million dollars, a pop for patriot missiles.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
fc	Okay .
fc	Bye bye.
ny	Uh huh.
qy^t	Do you want to start?
b	Right.
qy	did you get to go to Hawaii?
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
qw	What islands did you go to?
sd	Kauai,
b^m	the big one,
sv	With, the big one I thought was very commercialized.
sv	But the other two were just lovely.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah
b	That's right.
aa	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
qy	Did you go there?
sv	That was wonderful
sd	and we both enjoyed it very much.
bh	Have you?
ba	neat.
b	Yeah,
bh	did you?
b	Ooh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Were you?
sd	Well, I think if we ever go, it will only be for a three day.
ny	Yeah.
sv	It is just absolutely gorgeous with the mountains
sd	and we were there in the fall before the snows, you know, started
sd	And we would love to go back there
nn	No
sd	have not been to Spain.
bh	Were you?
qw	How old were you when you left?
b^m	ten months,
qy	Have you ever got to go back?
bh	Would you?
sd	And, I would like to go to Ireland.
ny	Uh huh.
b	uh huh,
sd	I would love to go there.
sd	And, course, there is a lot of places in the United States I still want to you know, go to.
ny	Yes,
na	We have been there.
sd	And they loved it.
sd	So, you know, I've touched on that.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Now that's a pretty city.
sd	Very clean. You know.
sd	Utah is a pretty state from what I remember of it.
b	Uh huh
nn	no,
na	We like the motels,
sd	And we did a lot of camping out there in the Smokeys
sd	and, it's hot down here
sd	so, and then the kids were getting older and were involved in activities so the camping sort of went by the wayside. And, although our son loves to fish
sd	and our daughter and her husband are talking now about starting camping with their boys now that they have gotten older.
qw	What was that?
sd	And, to, the Brazos River near Dinosaur Valley State Park.
b	Uh huh.
qo	What are they like?
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, there, well supposedly,
sd	it would have slept three adults anyway.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
qy	do they have a kitchen in them?
^2	Trunk of your car all time, right.
na	maybe back to Caddo, or, Purdis Creek.
 sd	Or, I like Bob Sandlin too,
sd	And there is, not really camping,
sd	Lake Joe Pool.
sd	And sometime, I like to go to Eisenhower up on Lake Texoma.
^h	from those three,
ny	Yeah,
sd	it's not very deep.
sd	And they did build a dam on it,
sv	Apparently, an earth quake caused it.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
h	And I don't know,
 b	Right.
fc	It was nice talking to you.
fc	Yeah,
fc	Bye,
b	Okay.
aa	Okay,
b	Right,
b	wow.
sd	we have a six percent sales tax.
ny	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I don't mind my taxes as much as my social security.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
h	But, I don't know,
sd	That's what I thought.
sd	and I know a lot of kids, like going to college with me, that lived in New York or out of state, a lot of them would buy their clothes in Pennsylvania just for the simple sake of not paying that,
b	Uh huh.
b	No,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
bf	Deduct, yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and, I graduated with a finance degree,
sd	Clarion University.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Yeah,
 sv	you know, they always have the argument, Well, you know, well who's to say we don't work harder to get that you know,
sv	well I don't care how much they take off of you, you know
sv	you're still going to be above, on top,
b	Uh huh.
 aa	I agree with you.
h	I don't know,
sd	and then the more I think about it, the more I think, I'm paying in to something that I,
sv	but I'm never going to see that.
sv	Social Security is going to be gone before I ever get any.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I'm sorry,
b	Uh huh.
ny	yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	you have decent roads at least .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
sd	instead of thinking how much, you know, that I'm paying out, I like to just look at it and say well everyone else is doing it too, you know.
sv^t	Well, I believe that the voice, that, initialized this call asked about, if we thought that it should be something that should be put into action.
aa	Yes,
na	definitely.
sd	I know that there are many countries that, are very successful with the operation of the government, providing that plan.
no	I'm not sure how their program is run,
sd	And I would really have to, read the history of, the country that has fared very well with it,
aa	Yes,
b	Yes,
sv	Well, I would think that they would have that as part of the benefit to the health care program, that you would indeed have a choice that you could select that individual yourself.
sv	And I'm sure that they would have a history of each doctor, and hopefully that they would have their, accreditations there too.
aa	Yes,
b	Uh huh,
sv	And of course they would give a full plan of what their intentions would be,
sv	I'm not sure what else that, we could address, on health care, other than the fact, I think, the eyes and the ears and the, whole self should be, included in all of that.
sv	dental, eye care, and, our body as a whole should be included in that because there are so many avenues that needs to be, undertaken in a program like that.
sd	I wouldn't want to have to go for a private doctor for anything and not be covered by the program.
b	Uh huh.
qy	And does he have an option if he doesn't care for the personality?
bk	I see .
sv	Well, if he's pleased with it, I guess that's, the bottom line.
sv	So, but I would be afraid of what would happen if you had a personality conflict or something.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm very thankful that I'm not under any doctor's care .
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh,
na	Well, I have a brother that lives there .
sd	near, Philadelphia.
b	Okay.
qy	Are you a native Pennsylvanian?
bk	Okay,
aa	Yes it is,
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
sv	That has broadened so much also.
sv	That is, the fields that, you know, are opening up are, just phenomenal.
sv	I mean, look at the AIDS, case you know, I mean that's a whole new field in itself.
sv	it's an auto immune deficiency
sv	but it sure is a dilly one.
aa	Yes,
bf@	To eradicate it entirely, yeah.
sv	Well, there's guidelines that people have to follow,
ba	That's true, too.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, you just have to ban the smoking to their to their little room that they want to,
b	Uh huh,
sv	Well, it's a bad habit tha ,
aa	Yes.
fc	And, well, you do the same.
fc	Okay,
ba	Probably so,
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	I think so too.
sd	and very few people carpool
sd	the people that I know don't want to because, they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job
sd	they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon, you know, they just feel they need their car.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's right.
sv	And people don't want to give it up
sv	but, you know, I don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent
sd^c	Well, my other line is ringing
ad^c	but we're going to ignore it .
fa^c	I'm sorry for these beeps,
sd^t	close to five minutes, I believe.
qy^d	And you're in Minneapolis,
qy	Well, is the pollution really bad up there?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well that's the way it has gotten here.
sv	but, I think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them for that
sv	and, but if they are polluting the air, they do need to have them fixed
sd	and you know, there's a big move, especially in the industrial part in Texas right now of controlling the C F C s that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air they're having to change the type of products they use
sd	like, I have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business
sd	and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of freon that they use in the air conditioning systems
sd	therefore, the individual, every time they have a service call, if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty two freon or whatever it costs them three times as much to get it fixed
sd	and, if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many C F C s into the atmosphere it doesn't cost as much so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems, you know,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's probably happened to millions of people,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
b	Yeah.
^2	Inhaled so much of it,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	mostly from T V too.
sd	we do take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	and with interest, you know I found some people that were members of our church which was different.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	So that was interesting,
b	No.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
 b	Right.
b	Right.
bh	Do you?
sd	channel five for some reason has always been the one I watch.
no	I don't know
b	Uh huh.
qy	The C N N, is that what that is?
b	Huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah
sd	I don't get that channel .
b	Yeah,
sv	That is if you want to go to bed early
sd	I think I'm skeptical about the whole thing. and still a little bit worried about them because of the history of Russia.
sd	And they're in a state of flux right now e , changing a great deal primarily because of the economic distress.
sv	And even in that situation, it seems like to me from what I've read in the history of Russia and you know different authors, there has always been a paranoia .
sv	and that's why they put a lot of people to death.
b	Yes,
b	Yeah.
b	Sure.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	You know I think that it would be the leadership that I, mistrust.
fc	You too.
fc	Bye bye.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
nn	No,
aa	Yeah.
sd	Well , I have used, several techniques depending on what,
sd	when I wanted to go to an undergraduate institution, I was looking for something that was, you know, rather small and easy to get around, you know. And what I thought would be easy to get through.
aa	Yeah
aa	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	where did you go?
bk	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b^m	No.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
br^m	My voting experience?
sd	I, well, personally I've been very diligent until recent years. When I felt my vote was absolutely kind of washed down the drain.
sd	For the issues you know, that I felt really strong for, I think apathy has set in to a lot of people because of the way our politicians are and the way our country is being run.
sv	You really do have to study to get yourself, up to par with what is truly going on
sv	and that takes a lot of research
sv	and and that is an excuse because we are always, invo ,
sd	I know I'm heavily involved in other things
sd	and to take time out and, study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time
sd	and I don't have the time to devote to that
sv	and, you hopefully find you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard.
sv	And unfortunately they are not.
sv	And, it's really a dilemma, that we find ourselves in, I believe.
sd	So I kind of just have taken a back step away and, hopefully that someone will clean up the mess that's there.
sd	because it is a task that is, to me, kind of overwhelming.
b	Right,
b	Yeah.
b	Yes.
sv	Well, I know that when you're in a smaller community,
sd	and, when we have, a local election, say for our mayor and so forth they really, give a lot of information in the local newspaper, not in the bigger city Dallas newspaper,
sd	I mean, they just give it a small portion of the newspaper,
sd	and then they raise a, they raise two sides
sv	and, you can really, feel comfortable in, evaluating that, candidate by, that method.
sd	I feel pretty confident about the way it's put forth.
sv	I mean, they've got people that are running that are admitted, criminals and admitted crooks.
fa	You know, I'm sorry,
sv	And, without the Lord, they can't do it.
o	Okay.
sv	So maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something.
sv	it's definitely a big concern,
sv	So it's pretty scary.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	It's rough, because ,
b	Yeah.
sv	That would be one thing that, you know, I think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties, you know, for certain crimes .
b^r	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
bk	okay.
sd	And they don't really,
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's awful.
sv	So that's probably something else they could do.
h	I don't know,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	and it's definitely got to do with crime.
sd	They said, some of the statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are addicted to crack,
sd	So I don't know who's the victim there.
b	Yeah.
bk	Okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
fc	Have a good day.
fc	Bye, bye.
sv	Well I just think the way that things are going that, it would be good for young people to go ahead and dedicate themselves to at least something.
sv	I know, like the Mormon religion, you know, they require two years of missionary service
aa	right,
b	yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	sure.
 +	and alcohol and just, helping old people, and, you know, helping cripple, just helping somebody else
sv	and I think that art of giving is something that, we don't have very much any more.
sd	I think they just gave it a title
sd	but is this not something that's, in legislation or in work some
b	yeah,
aa	I think so, too.
sv	they don't even have a direction to give their time to,
sv	it'd be really good I think.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
o	yeah,
sv	and, you know, having that, gung ho plan that's, you know, setting their life goals.
b	Uh huh.
sv	But as for its being required you know, we're not based on that, type of a system.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	right.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah,
sd	Damned if I know.
sv@	I, I suspect we should probably have an independent auditing agency go in and look at how the government spends money. And work from there. because I don't think they're very good at it.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah,
b	Yes.
ba	So, you're right.
bk	okay.
sv	But, that's not going to work,
qy^d	And that way just create more jobs or whatever?
ba	, well, that's a neat idea.
b	Yeah,
qw^d	Like what?
qy	you think that would, have a major effect?
sv	that might have a good effect on, on crime anyway.
ba	That's probably true.
sv	And probably a lot of.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's true often times they are paid more, yeah.
b	Right.
br	That's just what on their part,
bk	Oh.
b	that maybe true.
b	Right.
b	Right,
b	Yeah,
sv@	I mean . We don't need to buy other people's stuff right now . * new slash unit after the first period?
b	Right,
b	Right,
aa	I think so.
b	Yes.
sd	really I love the switch.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
no	greed, I suspect.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	For making, you mean, government issue underwear?
ba	Jesus.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	Right.
b	okay,
qy^d	Thomas?
b	Uh huh.
qy	Doesn't Wisconsin have a, state, Medicare program or health program?
b	Right.
sv	And that is, we become so debt ridden and credit oriented instead of, cash and carry or debt free
sv	and therefore, that puts a lot of undue pressure on municipalities, state and federal governments.
b	Right.
sv	see the thing is when a lot of things become acceptable practice it's hard to discern what has become muddy as to what is ethical and what is not ethical.
sv	And then someone blows the whistle and says, this is not ethical and yes I did it too.
b	Yeah,
sd	He also, was a congressman. to Congress.
sd	And he had been in that position for years.
sd	And, he was elected mayor of Dallas overwhelmingly.
sd	However, if the vote was taken today, the whole thing might change because he was part of that, check kiting scam .
qy^d	The war?
qy^d	You mean in terms of the economy
sd^t	I thought we were going to talk about social changes.
bk	okay .
b	Okay
sv	because, I mean, I know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over,
sv	and even people that didn't agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that, you know, and support the soldiers,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	yeah.
b	Yeah
 +	just drastically altered.
b	Yeah,
 b	Yeah.
sv	Even dog licenses
b	Yeah.
^2	Going to effect too many,
sd	but, you know, every week it gets harder
sd	you know, so that's a big, stress I think, you know, for the social changes in our family.
b	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
 +	in terms of women feeling like they have to have a career, be mom, be, everything, superperson .
b	Yeah,
sv	whereas before that never would have happened ,
sv(^q)	people would have said, why are you going to work.
sv	So, that's kind of a difference for us.
b	Yeah,
sd	So, it's now he has the pressure too of being superdad and supercareer
aa	Yeah,
sd	MISTER MOM
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	my family was real liberal,
sv	and, you know, I think there's so much prejudice still there,
sv	and it's kind of more covert now.
 sv	and now, you know, I think there's still tremendous amount of prejudice,
 sv	but people think, we're in the nineties, we're beyond all that, you know .
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
 sd	you know, because when I was growing up in Chicago, we were in a real ethnic neighborhood
 +	you know , from any place other than Texas hardly, you know.
 ba	boy.
 b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
 b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	We lived in a dorm.
sd	and ours was, international you know, co ed dorm,
sd	and there were twelve hundred students,
 sv	because it really is exciting, to be around people of different cultures and different backgrounds.
sd	We got invited to,
sd	I wonder if he was from, Iran, or some place,
 +@	Yeah,
b	uh huh.
b	Oh.
 b	Yeah,
 b	yeah.
 ba	God.
 b	Yeah,
 ba	gosh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	gosh,
sd	my kids are going to be hating me,
^q	so you can afford to pay the insurance, you know .
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
bk	Okay.
fc	You too,
aa	well, I can.
sd	I mean I live in a nice area
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
sd	And, he's recently moved here
sd@	But the houses around here, there's five houses on my street for sale right now. Which is just, in trouble to me.
sd	And they're not very expensive either.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
ny	Uh huh.
bh	have you?
b	Yeah.
b^m	No,
bh	really?
b	Oh.
nn	No,
 %	but, Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	so that was kind of interesting .
sv^t	they're sure getting their people out,
fc	and,
fc	Okay,
fc	Bye bye.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm pretty much the same way,
b	Yeah.
sd	My in laws listen to the kind of music I hate .
aa@	The old, real old, yeah.
sd	But other than that, I like pretty much everything.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
qy	Do you like Kenny G?
b	Uh huh.
ba	no.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	and I thought, no wonder
 fc	You all have a good day.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	Well, we don't do so much now,
sd	And then with our children, we had a pop up tent camper.
sd	And we used that to go camping.
sd	years ago we lived in Oklahoma
sd	But, when we did it with our children, we lived in, Tennessee
ny	Uh huh.
na	It got real cold,
sd	so you know, we had our bedding.
sd	And, that got kind of rough sometimes .
qy	do you?
b	uh huh.
ba	just beautiful.
b	Yes.
b	Yes,
b	But, yeah
sd	And I agree with him.
sd	Our children are grown,
sd	And we got just strictly by ourselves.
sd	you know, and we could, you know, get back in touch with each other .
ba	I know.
 +@	Or enjoyed it. Uh huh.
b	Yes,
b	Yes,
b	and,
 +	Yes,
b	Yes .
sd^m	One,
sd	But, I know that you know, as a teenager growing up and going to Lake Murray, there would be maybe twenty, twenty five of us because it would be all of my mother's family, you know, and all my cousins.
ba	no.
sd	we were in the woods, you know.
sd	Well, we didn't notice it back then,
sd	And, you know, it always rained on us.
b	Uh huh.
b	Cuddle up, uh huh.
h	Well, I don't know,
sd	and the water rushed down
sd	and, you know , There went several things floating down this water, you know.
sd	We just used to have balls.
sd	You know, it was more fun.
 sd	And then my folks had a cabin at one time at Lake Tenkiller
aa	Yes,
b	Yeah
sd	And I know if I go home and say, let's go camping, my husband says, you're crazy .
fc	I enjoyed talking to you, too.
fc	Thank you.
sd	just here in Dallas.
b	Uh huh.
b	yes,
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	okay.
qw	What type of foods do you cook
sd	And to me, that's the type of thing that I like to give in, cooking for people.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
qw	What kind of meals did she make that you liked?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	No.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	People can entertain themselves, I think, a great deal more, when you have a barbecue. Especially when you have hot dogs and hamburgers and, you know, nothing really fancy, like your shish kabobs, where you have to do a whole bunch of work.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
sd	you know, my mother used to make an Armenian rice dish.
sd	I'm thinking about, special dishes,
sd	And then you'd simmer it like all day long.
aa	Yeah.
sd	and there's so much broth and juice in there, that it has to, soak up into the rice, all day long, in order for it to come out fluffy and nice.
sd	And that was, you know,
ba	That's true.
ba	That's true.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
 b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Yeah!
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	And, what they have is this honey baked ham,
qy	have you had any of those?
sd	if you ever get a chance to buy one of those, I think it was, twenty dollars, for, I don't remember how many pounds it was.
sd	But you cook it in the bag that they send it in.
 sd	And all the juices and everything are all sealed in.
sd	But with this honey bake that they have, that's the only one I have been able to find there at Sam's warehouse.
sd	And it slices great. Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow!
 sd	But that's the only ham I have found that I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoy.
b	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right .
b	Right.
b	yeah.
na	Well, my parents actually started it,
sd	Well, it's true.
sd	And then gradually they started switching over to, plain rice, no gravy.
sv	it really is.
sd	And they started doing this, like or in about the middle seventies.
b	yeah.
ba	It's true,
ba	So, it's really neat.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	That's right.
b	Right .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow!
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow!
 b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow, that's good.
b	Uh huh.
^h	this is kind of tough.
sd	I don't have a lot of time
sd	But, I watch things like, SIXTY MINUTES,
 +	every week.
ny	Yeah,
qo	but, How about you?
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I can't think of the name of the one that has the, military, fellow.
sd	I mean he's playing a military part.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	On Saturdays they have, a variety of things,
 sd	and, they have a calligraphy show,
sd	And, they have a lot of cooking shows,
 sd	And, you know, I'll just short of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Okay.
aa	Okay.
fc	Okay.
fc	Good bye.
 +@	What do you do?
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I have to do something where I can do it at home.
sd	and I love to do all kinds of crafts and stuff like that.
aa	No,
sd	But you know, I don't have a whole lot of time now but I have more time than I did,
sd	And a lot of my sewing I kind of do out of necessity, you know,
b	Oh.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	I enjoy playing volleyball but you know, I, I don't have a lot of time to do it,
 sd	It's maybe once a year or something
b	But, yeah,
b	Uh huh.
na	I love to read, but you know, I don't have a lot of time to read an,
 +	You know, what reading I do, I kind of do because you know, it's the necessary stuff
b	Yeah,
 %	And, just,
qy	you know, you make clothes for them and everything like that.
sd	those have been real popular with my family.
sd	you know, it's like I can only do it when I have time.
ny	Oh yeah,
sd	Those are real,
sv	Those are real popular,
b	Uh huh,
sd	I just kind of sew for my kids
b	Yeah,
fc	Okay,
fc	Good luck in school.
fc	Bye, bye .
ny	Uh huh,
ng	Not really,
sd	but, I do basically like the shrubbery and the planting and the weeding
sd	and, I do the edging and stuff like that,
sd	But, I try and do as much, you know flowering as I can, and that kind of stuff. The seasonal things.
sd	But, I think we have one of the nicest yards in the neighborhood .
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sd	I don't .
nn	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and so we have some bushes, but we don't have too many,
sd	and, they keep hitting the tree with the lawn mower.
sd	You know, every time you do that, it, kind of kills the tree for a while.
sd	And so that's kind of stunt its growth for just a while until we get it back going again.
sd	And we started mowing our own lawn
sd	because they were doing that.
 +	that kind of thing.
sd	And they also edged,
ny	Yeah,
ny	Yes
 sd	it's like seventy a month.
b	Yeah,
sd	They take care of the, landscape,
sd	so they care of that
sd	and there is a pond,
sd	so you're basically paying,
sd	and and so that way if someone moves out, the entire neighborhood is mowed and watered and that kind of thing, you know.
na	Well, it, it went up what we pay.
sd	And that's the bad thing.
sd	I don't know what to do if you can't afford it .
 %	So, but, they're, unless you don't want them to do it.
na	only like, in the common areas and in the island.
sd	But they don't do it in your yard.
na	Right,
ba	I know.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	Just rearranged some things .
b	Oh.
bh	really?
b	Oh.
b	yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
ba	I bet.
b	Yeah,
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	boy.
b	Yeah
sd	and so I keep hearing the forecast it's going to rain, it's going to rain, it's going to rain,
sd	I know.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	and if it's not nice and they can't go out, it's really the pits .
sd	But I appreciate it when they can at least go play in the backyard for an hour or something, you know.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean all Winter long he's been wanting a pool in the backyard.
sd	I really miss that,
b	Yeah.
b	Oh .
b	really
b	yeah.
qy	Do have air conditioning in your car
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
fe	Gosh.
b	Yeah.
sd	we never used to have to water our lawns
sd	you know in Chicago it was always enough rain here and there
sd	so here if you don't water it just looks awful.
sd	I just hate to spend the money just going down the drain and watering grass, you know.
b	Yeah
b	Yeah,
b	yeah,
ba	boy.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
fe	boy.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	a hundred and ten degrees
sd	And I can't stand to be outside at all when it's like that,
sd	We had our air conditioning break , last Summer.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
fe	Gosh
sd	They had to replace all their carpeting and everything,
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	really.
b	Yeah,
fc	Okay,
fc	Thanks.
ny	Yeah,
sd	Some that, she had to, label everything .
ny	Yeah
sd	It was a Cadillac.
sd	And well, they quit making those, the quieter jet carburetor
sd	They rebuilt it
b	Yeah.
sd	a Maverick and also, a Chrysler station wagon before that.
sd	I'm replacing the, two or three starters on the Chrysler.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Yeah.
sd	my Chrysler van
b	Yeah.
na	It's a eighty seven.
b	Uh huh,
qr	rides or runs?
ny	yeah,
sd	it took me a while to get used to a four cylinder engine.
sd	You have to kind of wait for it, especially when you get on the highway.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	You driven American cars all,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Not much gas mileage, though.
ba	wow.
b	Yeah.
qy	Now, do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I have a long experience with cars.
 sv	It just, to me it makes absolutely no economic sense to do that.
 sd	In fact, I, just this past weekend put new plugs in both, my car an my wife's car.
 sd	And so, I pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything I can do myself
sd	I mean I don't know whether I've just reached a point, you know,
 sd	And, so, I try to make sure that, by the time fall runs around, because we actually have winters here on the east coast,
 +	that, you know, the car's in pretty good shape enough to last through the winter
 sd	And you're required to get your car and go through the emission test,
sd	But the thing was that I could do the job myself,
sd	if I'd taken it someplace and have it done it was going to be three hundred twenty five.
qh	Now like who's got that extra two and a quarter ,
 b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
 sd	so, but, I think the difference is that, when you own the car you take more care in what you're doing,
sd	and you want to make sure that it's done right and put back together right,
 +	You know, those kind of things,
sv	And it's very, very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust.
sd	And, he's about sixty miles from here.
 b@	Uh huh
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean he just would not have anything to do with them.
sd	And, I guess there are some people out there like that, you know,
b	But, yeah,
sd	I trained my wife in the hou , in doing things,
sd	and, it was an interesting experience for her.
b	Yeah,
sd	it helps you figure out what's wrong with it,
 +	you know,
b	Uh huh.
^2	You should still be ,
sv	Well, they really are even when you're not talking about surgery.
sd	and, you know in the past month it just, they pass things from one to one
sd	and it just can devastate your budget, you know.
^q	Can still make big bucks .
qy	Do you think that the quality, it would would be as high?
b	Yeah.
 b^r	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
 b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, we're going to have to do something because there's just too many people in the country that are uninsured
sv	and you know you cannot,
ba	sure.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean I'm driving a piece of junk, you know
b	Right.
b	Right.
ad	Why don't you go ahead and start.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yes,
ny	Yeah,
b	Right,
no	I don't know,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Well
b	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yes
sv	that's true.
sd	they're always getting something in the mail
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh,
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's true,
na	I'm ready .
sd	I just like a nice, quiet, nice atmosphere and of course good food .
sd	that's always a concern, but just a nice quiet easy place maybe candlelight something just to relax, you know because I don't really go out to dinner that much,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Oh .
b	Yeah.
sv	and you can just relax, and stay as long as you want.
na	Well, nearby.
sd	So we have quite a bit between us and there.
sd	and there is all kinds of restaurants
aa	Yeah,
sd	But it's gone .
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's nice.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That is probably very fortunate for you.
ny	Yeah.
sd	because I have a twelve year old that would eat a happy meal every night, you know,
sd	so something's happened here,
ny	Uh huh,
sd	Well, we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around
sv	and it's tempting when you come home from work
sv	You know, it adds up
qo	Well, how's California today? .
bh	Is it?
qy	Have you always lived there?
bk	Oh.
qy^d	And you like it?
b	Yeah,
b	yeah.
ba	that would be fun.
b	Yeah.
b^m	No.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
sd	and her coach is in California.
ny	And, yeah,
sd	And I love it,
sd	I have my twelve year old in school
sd	and she's happy.
bh	Uh huh?
 ny	Well, yes,
b	Yes.
 ny	Yes,
sv	It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks, you know, that get into the system.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That happens on occasion,
h	You know, I don't know,
sv	I think I would be, you know,
aa	yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yes.
b@	Yes, uh huh.
aa	Yes
aa	absolutely.
ng	Not with me personally.
sd	It's not to me personally,
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes,
sv	But, I think the U S is one of the few countries that still do.
aa	Yes,
 sv	A lot of them had to have elected not to do so.
b	yes.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
sv	there's a lot of, you know, last minute, things that happen cause a person not to, have to go through the whole thing.
ny	Yes,
aa	Yes,
aa	Yes,
aa	Yes,
nn	No,
sv	we hope that it will be, you know, some sort of deterrent or, you know, an eye for an eye type thing, or something like that.
bf	Easiest way out maybe.
b	Yes,
aa	Absolutely.
aa	Yes,
b	Yes.
ba	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Absolutely.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
aa	So would I,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Sure,
b	Yes.
aa	Yes.
sv	it's a tough subject,
b	Right.
fc	Well, thank you,
fc	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
qy^t	Did you hit one.
bk	All right.
sd	kind of neither.
sd	I do have some Republican leanings, because, I am division one, you know .
sv	I think it's a stinking shame that there isn't capital punishment for those assholes that stold our money.
aa	I agree with you.
sd	You know, we've watched and watched T V and seen that a lot of these people were doing things, not just playing in the gray and not just reselling property at a profit, but financing the same property three and four times, you know,
sd	and the list goes on and on. You know, of just the crimes committed. Much less for criminals that should be indicted.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	And, everyone forgets that there are several of these people that are wanted by the federal government currently and are overseas where extradition is merely a funny American word.
sv	as far as being a Republican or a Democrat, I think no American could stand for criminal action.
sd	in theory, a healthy economy has a lot of spending going on.
sd	And, if people are making money, people can spend money,
sv	And, for what they would cost
sv	We, as Americans weren't producing anything.
sd	And, I'm sorry we don't get into a real argument over it,
sv	Remember all we're doing is delivering pizzas to each other.
b	Yeah.
sv	It is a life and death struggle, with the Japanese.
sv	I'm very tired of it all pays by the hour.
sd	and I'm nonexempt.
br	What?
qw	what does a nonexempt sound like?
sd	now maybe I'm not the, typical nonexempt that you deal with.
sd	And, I am degreed, though nonexempt.
ar	No .
ar	No,
nn	no,
sd	right now I'm just trying to tool crib and chips.
sv	Times are bad.
sd	They turned all installation up here off.
sd	They told facilities they could not work.
^q	I don't care what the jobs are, you will not work.
sd	and, as far as you know, our conversation goes, I would really be interested to know how much of T I's problems now are related to, the banking structure.
sd	it really hurts me, to realize that a lot of people out there are trying to retire on their home values.
sd	one of our senior,
nn	No.
sd	Our economy in Colorado Springs fell completely apart.
b	Right.
sd	Seattle.
^2	Secorski Boeing.
sd^t	Well, discussing air pollution today, I guess.
ad	well, give me your first impressions.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	gets a whole new picture to what real air pollution can be,
bk	Okay,
sd	But, in Dallas, we've just, brought in a whole new set of requirements on inspections and things like that for cars, because, people just don't use mass transit and stuff in Dallas.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
ba	That's true,
b	Yeah,
sd	there were always E P A people and what not were always telling us that, farm chemicals and what not were destroying our water system and all that
sd	but we just never saw the results.
sv	I don't think Dallas is considered, a real bad place for air pollution,
sd	and, it's a little, it's a little disappointing sometimes you start to realize what you're breathing.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sv	you know, let the natural systems take care of the problem as much as possible.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	it's kind of like,
sv	you know, there's a lot of things like that.
b	Yeah,
sv	and, we've done a lot to take care of it.
b	sure.
ba	there's no doubt about it.
sd	I don't know if you ever happened to see some of the like, Twenty Twenty and what not about Rumania and East Germany when they first got pictures out of there about how some of their systems had been running for twenty and thirty years
sd	and, you know, they had absolutely no regulations, no controls whatsoever,
fc	Well, you bet.
fc	Bye.
sd^t	Well, Jean, the subject is jury trials
sd	Now my personal opinion,
sv	It's just not right.
sv	And therefore I think juries should be able to recommend sentencing.
ny	Yes,
sd	I've never done it myself unfortunately,
sd	I wish I could have.
sd	I've just never been called up.
sv	Well now, that's possible.
sd	But, I was called up as an alternate once,
ng	Not that I know of.
b	Uh huh
sv	well, there again, I suppose it should be.
na	Exactly.
sv	that's not too bad in this sense, because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances
sv	I mean, that's happened and giving them another trial might give them additional time to, prove their innocence.
aa	Yes.
sv	We can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's it,
sd	out here in Texas we had a, a, great miscarriage of justice.
sd	a Black man was accused simply because he resembled someone who held up, a, Seven Eleven, I think it was.
sd	And even though he had witnesses that said that, he was at work,
na^m	They found him guilty.
na	Well, they said this happened during lunch time.
sd	And he could have gotten away at lunch time and committed the robbery.
sd	But after nine years,
ba	Exactly.
sv	Now that just was not fair.
b	Yes.
sv	Unfortunately, that's what happens.
sv	the, the First Amendment definitely says freedom of speech
 +	not freedom of action.
sd	And, well that just rancles me
sd	Well, I happen to be a flag freak.
sd	I was in Korea
 sd	and, well, I saw what the red in the flag represents.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	See how they'd like it under another flag.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, Jean, we seem to be of the same opinions here.
sd^t	I hope they get something out of this.
qy	 passing sentence? Well, yes,
sv	but I think the jury should be able to recommend,
ny	Yes.
ny	yes,
sd	I don't know if that's a regular procedure or what.
b	Yes.
sd	They may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
sd	well, they say after three offenses its automatically life in prison,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	Race or nationality even.
sv	But, like you said, it's not the best system,
b	Uh huh.
 ba	Sure enough.
fc	Well let's hope neither one of us ever has to run into this subject we were discussing.
fc	Take care now.
fc	Bye.
sd	Well, I think that, women working is the one that really affects me most strongly right now.
sd	Well, women in general, and also myself.
sd	But, it used to not really make a difference to me,
sd	and right now I'm kind of stuck because I'd like to have children,
sv	And, in our society right now that's really something that's, not respected,
sv	I mean, there's a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family if the wife is going to actually be a mother.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
sd	I just wish there was a way,
sd	I don't know.
sv	I'm sure until at least school age, and maybe longer.
sv	What this does is, it allows the government to subsidize her to be the mother of her children rather than to subsidize child care
 +	to raise the child for her.
 sv	And I think that that's a much, much more viable solution, really.
b	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
^h	goodness,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	I don't see how they could be, especially not if they have to pay for child care.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	some people now it seems like are turning back toward actually trying to find out what they're in it for, instead of just,
sv	You know, it's just a place to go, to visit, to wear your nice clothes, and to sit around and talk,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	yes.
sv	Maybe not as much as now
b	Okay .
fc	Nice to talk to you.
fc	Bye bye.
aa	Okay.
sd	my oldest two are already out and about in the world
sd	and, my youngest is twelve.
b	yeah.
sd	at any rate, my first two children, I didn't spend a whole lot of time with them.
sd	and, you know, was a problem with having five children needing to work a full time job that, was more than a full time job.
sd	I, worked about fifty one hours a week, because I worked eleven hours every Sunday.
sd	And, so I didn't get to spend as much time with them as I should have, as I really wanted to.
ny	Yeah.
sd	but it was, more an impact, I think, on the oldest two.
sd	Because, about the time I got out of working that long hours was when the twins were about three years old.
sd	You know, with all the children around the house, it's, kind of hard to notice that Dad isn't around, very much.
sd	so, what I've tried to do, now that I've,
sd	And, so, then I came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as I did fifty one hours, a week.
sd	So, I've tried to spend more time with, the children since then.
sd	what I'm currently doing is, taking a lot of time.
sd	And so, every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the, movies.
sd	And, it's working out pretty well.
sd	in fact, I found that I'm a lot closer with,
sd	he's taken off for parts unknown,
aa	but, yeah.
sd	and, my daughter has moved out of the house.
sd	And so it's, it's, it's been difficult to try to find the time,
sd	And I noticed parents not spending time with their, children and going out and doing things.
sd	And, you know, I knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine
sd	I saw the family falling apart down, there.
b	Yeah.
sd	And I'm doing my best to keep that up.
b	Yeah.
na	she didn't up until the last, six months.
na^m	She just recently, started working.
sd	she worked a job until we moved to our new house
b	Huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
na	Certainly do.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	And, you know, he worked a full time job and a part time job,
sd	and I never saw him.
sd	So, I didn't have much of a role model to go by. {D You, know, } to learn how to be a father and, a parent, and that kind of thing, because, I can't ever remember playing ball with my dad or, catch with my dad, or doing anything with my dad.
aa	Yeah.
sv	You know, everybody's not FATHER KNOWS BEST.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yes.
b	Yes.
sd	you know, I've helped out extremely,
sv	And, as you know, with five children it takes a lot of work.
sv	Even, if, even if someone's home all the time, there's still a lot of things that have to be done.
sd	well, now I work for Texas Instruments.
b	Yeah.
o@	* slash error right. / * slash error
b	Yeah.
sd	 I was more intelligent than the position I was holding.
aa	Yes.
sd	I mean, I was smarter than most of the people that I was working for.
sd	And, you know, every time something new came up, I was explaining it to them.
o	No .
b	Yeah
b	Yeah
sd	So, you know, I got my degree and got the better paying job,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
ba	Great.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Have you ever, organized a family reunion?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	it is not that big.
sd	Because, we have had sort of weekends like that too.
sd	I sort of think of a reunion with all the extended family .
b	Yeah.
sd	it is kind of hard to get everybody organized.
sd	he keeps food out there, year round.
qy	so he does not live there though?
bf	Vacation home.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	The rest of it is sort of a big void to me.
sd	we all got together,
sd	Nice to have everybody together at once and things like that.
nd	Well, not quite French,
sd	but, it was sort of a reunion before leaving.
b	Yeah.
sd	So that would be kind of fun.
b	Yep.
sd	But at least that way it is at nobody's house, so no one person is responsible for everything.
b	Yep.
ba	That is for sure.
qy	does your dad have horses there?
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	So it was not so worth it.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That sounds,
ba	Well, that is pretty big .
sd	I do not know how they do scale down there.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	And they were having problems with too many goldfish because we had put some goldfish in,
sd	And, somebody suggested to get a bass.
sd	And so they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it again .
nn	No.
sd	So we do not know whether it is living
aa	Yep.
sd	We still have lots of little goldfish.
b	Yeah,
sd	we have got hundreds in there now,
sd	And, and some of them are probably eight inches long.
sd	But he wants your really big ones, you know, the ones that get to be like a foot and a half long.
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Because he was trying to catch them, you know, using little,
 sd	My father was taking those and trying to catch the goldfish.
qy	But do you guys have fishing competitions while you are there?
b	Uh huh.
qw	What do you feed them?
bh	Really?
qy^d	And it is especially made for catfish.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That is funny.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	But I have never seen them, just alive someplace.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	How big do they get?
qw@	Okay. But how long in feet?
 ba	That is pretty big though.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
fc^m	Nice talking to you too.
fc	Enjoy your, weekend.
fc	Okay.
o	Okay.
b	Right.
qo	how do you feel about it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I don't know a judge might be a little more cold blooded about it.
b	Yeah,
nn	No,
b	Yeah.
 b	Uh huh.
sv	Course they have such a crime problem because they have such a unemployment rate.
sv	Get that unemployment way up
sv	Well, in Florida seems like, two or three times a year.
b	Yeah.
 sv	So, of course, the attorneys, take them through the whole chain. You know, even if the case is open and closed,
sv	they go all the way up to the Supreme Court, you know.
sv	They almost always get thrown right back out again,
sv	Some of these guys are really, you know, violent Son of Sam killers and stuff like that, you know.
sv	everyone knows they're not going to get out.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
na	I think so.
sd	a lot of the, the other violent crimes I don't really feel that strongly about.
sv	I mean, these guys are certainly not going to, be,
ad	Reduce the violence in the prisons.
sv	But some of these guys just don't care, {D you know.
b	Yeah,
sv	that's possible I guess.
qw	so where do you live in Pennsylvania?
bk	okay.
sv	that all depends, too, on where you are at.
b	Uh huh.
br	Two hours where?
bk	okay.
sd	Polk Institute.
sd	Very old, historical place there.
sd	Sharon, Pennsylvania's up there.
b	Yeah.
b	okay.
^2	In that case, maybe, you know.
b	Right.
sv(^q)	like, I don't want that person sharing the Earth with me, you know,
sd	And, you know, we had a case like that here
b	Yeah.
sv@	You can plea bargain what you're guilty of, but, you know. But not how they're going to sentence you ,
b	Right,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	And perhaps we can
sv	And, although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are guys that are, you know going to get caught anyways
sd	we just had a terrible case in Virginia where some girl disappeared
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
qy	Do you have department store credit cards too,
b	Uh huh.
^2	Appliances.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	We still pay it off every month if it kills us .
sd	But, we do it mainly for, you know, the cash flow,
sd	And, I often will keep track of what I've charged and sometimes deduct it from my checkbook already.
sd	and keep a list and make sure I I don't go over a certain limit. Especially around birthdays, you know.
b	Oh.
sd	If we go out to a restaurant, just to float it,
b	Yeah.
sd	Even if we have the,
sd	We have a new one from A T AND T
sv	Be interesting,
sd	It's a Mastercard, too,
sv	It's kind of fun,
b	Yeah,
^q	We'll give you five thousand dollars up front .
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
fc	Well, it sounds like I'm being paged otherwise.
fc	So .
fc	Good talking to you.
nn	No,
sv	I think something will have to be done down there very soon about Mexico and, some of the other areas,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
sv	and, it will come back to haunt us,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right,
sv	especially Columbia, is so built on t , on the drugs, that, our little war on drugs has really been laughable.
b	Right,
sv	And as long as we're the largest, consumer, then, this is the market.
sv	If we can cut back the usage, then maybe it will have to go someplace else.
b	Uh huh.
b@	Right, yeah, / * should this be two slash units?
 +	and, there has to be resentment built up,
b	Yeah.
sv	Very much so, except when we need them.
b	Yeah.
aa	Okay.
ba	Sure did.
aa	Always,
fc	You too, dear.
fc	Bye.
sd	Well, we've tried having,
sd	We had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought, Who'd want to eat that stuff.
sd	You know, so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here,
sd	So, right now we're just,
b	Yeah,
b^r	yeah.
ba	wow.
b	Yeah.
b	Really.
ba	boy
sd	If you don't have a frost you'll be all right .
ba	Wow.
ba	boy,
b	yeah,
sd	I love gardens that are well tended,
sd	So I do admire that, but I haven't really put, too much energy into it.
sd	So that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry, I'll tell you .
sd	that's really lovely.
sd	we've tried them,
sd	We've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the s ,
sd	People that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation and installed that,
sv	and that's really what makes the most sense,
sv	it really does the job.
sd	It's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives,
 b	Yeah.
sd	and it just, immediately heats up.
 sd	We always had gardens when I was, living in Chicago.
sd	but she used to love to do stuff like that.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
aa	yes .
b	Yeah,
 +	you know.
sd(^q)	He thought, what are these fun toys that mommy put out here with all these colors for me to play with?
b	Yeah,
fc	Nice talking to you.
o	All right.
qo	what's your views on it?
aa	Correct.
b	Well, yeah
sv	which is not very often.
qy	What do they do, just keep them on death row for the rest of their life.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you have the overcrowding in your prisons that we are facing down here?
sd	I know that we have, you know,
b	Yes.
sv	they do not have it in Europe, as I understand.
b	Yes,
qy	Well, England don't they have a fairly large welfare?
no	I don't know.
sv	if both do and they tend to have less crime, you wonder if that has anything to do with it then,
qy	do you?
ba	Well, that's interesting.
sd	all I know is that, for instance we were in Germany in,
aa	Of course.
sd	and, as a matter of fact, I can tell you something about that.
nn	No,
nn	No,
sd	And then my mother also owned and operated a nursing home, for years. And then, went on back to school and became the director of nurses at a nursing home .
sd	And, my mother and my older sister both are geriatric nurses.
sd	So, I do know something about that.
aa	Absolutely.
sd	Actually, the motivation for Grandmother entering the business, was that her mother was very old, and couldn't seem to find companions.
sd	She was lonely.
sd	And she needed company, for her mother
sd	and so she opened a nursing home and initially started with eight ladies.
sd	And then, it grew into a, very prosperous business from that point.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ad	Well, that is not really true, either,
sd	You see, those who had bad experiences talk about them.
sd	And those who do not may write, a letter to the nursing home and say you did good,
sd	but they do not talk a whole lot about that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	However, my daughter in law also is a nurse in a nursing home.
sd	And, she works for one here in Dallas, which is more a retirement village than it is a nursing home.
sd(^q)	I love watching these elderly people come, they will come and tell her. "Well I am going for my, tennis lessons.
^q	And, would you, you know, call down and have the van come around and take, us for our tennis lessons."
sd	And they are very active and very enthusiastic
sv	Their dining room looks like, you know, Luby's Cafeteria.
sd	or one of the lovely cafeterias.
sv	I am certainly very much for a nursing home
sv	It is expensive.
b	Uh huh.
sd	She still had her individuality,
sd	but they were there close
sd	And they have security.
b	No,
sd	I know that the elderly can easily be abused,
sd	but I would be willing to bet they are far less abused in a nursing home than they are in, homes of their own children.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Absolutely.
sd	Well now, my grandmother,
sd	and my grandmother developed Hodgkin's Disease, when she was in her late eighties, late seventies, I mean.
sd	She went to the doctor,
sd	She got better,
b	Uh huh.
sv	it is a place that you do not have to struggle with hospital, problems
sv	and yet it is not, you know,
b	Uh huh,
ba	It certainly is.
sd	I might, I might like to be, coherent enough to make my own choice.
sd(^q)	I would not particularly think I would want my kids to say, "well, I think this is what I need for Mom", and, then dump me there.
ba	That is right.
 +	or a doctor or anything else.
b	Uh huh,
ba	That is right.
ba	Absolutely.
ad	Go out to the nursing home, help guide some craft programs, perhaps, work on some music programs, whatever their talents are. And work with, those senior citizens.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	That is right.
sv	Routine and, constancy.
sd	the only real problem with that in a nursing home is that the staff turns over.
sv	and that is sad, because, I think the health profession is one of the most critical,
ba	That is right.
sv	Care for the elderly and care for the children, I cannot imagine a more costly and a more, a more, better area to invest,
 +	your money.
sv	You are preserving your heritage and your future there.
sv	And, as a matter of fact, I do not see why they do not have children's programs in nursing homes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^t	Was I supposed to do something?
ba	Good .
qy	Should we have been there?
qy	Did we do what was correct there?
qy	Should we have fought them harder?
qy^d	you agree with Schwartzkopf who says, Drive on into Baghdad.
qy	Would that be so bad?
sv	It wasn't ours.
sv	We've got to talk so it's just as well we argue.
aa	I agree.
b	Yeah.
sv	he wanted to take the current secondary highway system and turn it into interstates like the rest of the country.
qy^d	But wouldn't it be wonderful.
qy^g	And back east, you all drive at fifty five, don't you?
bk	okay,
sd	See, out here in the west a lot of our secondary roads are fifty five
sd	we drive sixty five.
ny	yes.
sd	And, between here and west Texas, there was probably three and four hours at sixty five miles an hour.
qw	How far west have you been?
qy^d	you've never, You've never seen the great American desert.
qy^d	The Rocky Mountains?
qy^d	Yellowstone?
sd	Well, my college educa , thirty six,
sd	know, virtually nothing else.
b	yeah.
ny	Yeah,
sd	In fact, down in east Texas where the company's located there's streams and water and things I don't understand. Trees and the gulf
sv	and it's really interesting.
ad	So tell me about where you live.
qw	how high is the highest elevation?
qy^d	three thousand feet?
qy^d	Close to sea level?
b	Okay,
b	yes
qw	How many hours have you been from home?
ny	Yes.
b	yeah.
sd	now when I was growing up in the Panhandle of Texas,
sd	To just go buy a pair of jeans, we'd drive an hour.
sd	When I was growing up, Now things are different
sd	and people buy jeans in town,
aa	Yeah.
b	Okay.
b	Okay,
qy	So are you working your way through college?
ba	Well, how neat.
b^m	Finance.
ba	Well, that's interesting.
qw	So, what do you plan to do with it?
qy^d	Savings and loans,
ba	that would be great.
sd	Apple Computer is coming to town.
ny	Yes.
sd	So we're expecting our local economy to , Well, maybe not a boom, but, at least, recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still.
sd	unemployment runs approximately six percent.
sd	But, now under employment I would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent.
sd	And the problem is that there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without a technical four year degree.
fp	Hi.
b	Uh huh.
sd	So I you know, didn't want him to have a job that would make him kind of be on call all the time, and have to go in at any time, and you know, even on the weekends and things.
sd	So that was important to me, and also insurance for our family because we'd like to be able to take care of our medical needs and not be thinking so much about whether or not you can afford it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's nice.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
ba	I know.
b	Uh huh.
 %	and we wanted to be able to go in and have our teeth cleaned and just checked all over
sd	We have, you know
sd	I don't think it's the basic,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and we don't like him to be, you know, having to drive an hour to work or something .
sd	So we kind of looked for where his office would be located
 +	and so by living in Plano we're just about fifteen minutes away.
sv	especially when they finish all the construction out here
sd	and we didn't want him you know, to,
sv	and not only is it, you know, trouble to have to drive, but it takes time away from your home and your family when you're out driving.
sd	And, so, that was something that was important to us,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Uh huh,
sd	was there somewhere to go.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 +	and that there would be some opportunity for friendships that way, so that you would feel happy going to work every day Rather than thinking I can't stand these people.
sd	But, so that's something that was important to him, in thinking he could work under.
sd	It's only been, not even a year yet,
b	Yes, well.
b	yeah.
b^m	You never know,
sd	and so we have a lot of family here, his side of the family.
sd	And although we had really good friends and we had church and school support and things, we were anxious to move close to family members, just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that.
sd	So, that really made a big difference, I think, in why we chose T I, and chose to move this way.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's nice.
b	Uh huh.
sd	We're really enjoying it.
sd	But it's turned out really good,
fc	Well I've really enjoyed the conversation.
fc	And, nice to have met you,
fc	Bye bye.
sd	well, I work with computers, just like your son
sd	and I actually do research in speech recognition
sd^t	part of the reason I'm participating in the project is to see how the stuff goes.
sd	But, I was working
sd	but hopefully the job that I will have will have lots of benefits namely lots of vacations not real good salary but lots of vacations.
b	Yeah
sv	because health care is so ridiculously expensive.
sd	we actually had a little baby so I'm taking a little bit of a time off from work.
ba	congratulations.
sd	and you know, our routine doctor's visits covered,
na	Right, yeah,
b	Right.
b	Right
sd	it doesn't cover doctor's visits, things like that.
aa	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And probably the medical care is less expensive, too.
b	Uh huh.
sd	So I think that in general the doctor's fees are probably lower there,
sd	Well, I know that friends of mine had a baby up in Boston
sd	and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in Manhattan.
sd	And they were at one of the better hospitals, you know
sd	and, you know, good doctors in Boston.
sd	And I was at one of the big hospitals in New York.
sd	But that's a huge difference just between
sd	you know, and it's two big cities that I think of as somewhat comparable.
sd	So I was pretty shocked at that.
sd	because it would be really nice to be able to have, you know, someone that could watch my daughter at work.
sv	It would be more convenient, more productive I think,
b	Uh huh.
^2	and your hours are, much more constrained and things like that.
sv	those three things, the health care, vacation, and day care are probably the most important benefits.
sd	I suppose I should be concerned with life insurance and, retirement plans
b	Yeah.
b	Right
sd	I would certainly accept a lower salary for that. You know, everything else being equal
sv	because your life would be so much easier.
sv	And there's a question of quality of life also.
b	Yeah.
sv	But unfortunately, there aren't,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
sv	But you know, I wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones. Just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and things like that.
sd	Because many times small companies offer better benefits in terms of quality of life than larger companies.
sd	Like, one company had proposed to me that I could come back to work after having the baby, any where between ten and forty hours a week. And, call my own days, call my own hours,
b	Yeah,
sv	many times at a large company it's almost impossible to do things like that.
b	Right.
sv	And if you get two weeks off, you get two weeks off and you're not allowed two weeks and one day.
sv	So it all depends on what your position is there, too.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Was that when you were, well,
b	Right,
sd	and we tried to argue that he should get more salary for that
 +	than what he is
b	Right,
sd	Because they say they can't pay more than this and that, and they're not allowed to pay him more than what his previous salary was and things like that
 sd	and, you know, times are rough now,
aa	Yeah,
b	Right,
sd	And, they pay him as a consultant but he doesn't get any health benefits,
sd	So really his salary should be, you know, twenty percent or thirty percent higher just based on that, not including the fact that you know, it's a long term commitment for the company and all that sort of stuff.
qy	Are you a T I er?
b^m	No.
bk	okay,
sv	So you don't have any benefits at all to talk about.
ad	You're just going to have to imagine what you would like as benefits .
bk	okay,
qy^d	Didn't get that far.
sv	you normally just try to sell them on your, aptitude and not, you know, well how much vacation do I get .
b	Yeah,
sd	Now they're going to start to do the same kind of thing with doctors.
sd	If you go to a doctor who isn't in the network then it will be less benefits that you get.
sd	We have some dental coverage now,
sd	I pay for the extra dental plus, so much more per month because it always seems like if you're going to have a crown or something major done it pays a little more.
sd	we do have pension, although I've realized recently that the pension doesn't seem to be too good
sv(^q)	After you've been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go, is that all that's in there.
sd	So, that grows pretty good
sd	Of course you can buy stock in the company,
aa	Yeah,
sd	And we ge , you know, vacation normally after you're here for six months
sv	Which, a lot of places make you work like ten years or so, before you get that much.
sd	And we get, decent holidays.
sd	So that's nice, so you always get two days at Christmas.
sd	You only have to take three days of vacation
ba	Whoa, okay!
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	So you can get glasses and contacts and stuff through those particular stores or something like that.
b	Yeah
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
b	Gee,
b	Right,
b	yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	like my husband always takes which is kind of like, you know, Contact stuff, only better.
 sd	So if you've got thirty in there it normally comes out to about thirty four dollars so when you pay five it's a pretty good savings.
sd	I haven't done any painting since I was a child
sd	when we bought our home it was recently updated.
sd	And the condominium we moved in before, my husband went over and painted,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	I know,
^2	Pane.
aa	No,
 +	it was like ten times longer than he already thought he would be done,
sd	And then we went in there, you know, one was, bu ,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
ba	boy.
sd	I mean, you know, they painted our rooms all the time,
sd	and so he had to paint the outside all the time.
b	No,
sd	No, no painting to have to do.
 %	I don't know that w ,
sd	We've been trying,
sd	you know, we've done that the whole time we were in school. Like, trying to repair our own cars,
sd	and, so } I want to get to the point where I could feel like I could just hire someone .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's true.
b	No.
 ^2	But, still, it's harmful,
sd	The only painting job that was really painless for us was in this condominium that the, association that manages it, they have to take care of like the structural damage.
sd	But they came in and did it and left in just no time at all,
b	Uh huh.
fc	Well, you too,
fc	I guess it's getting to be lunch time,
fc	You have a good day.
fc	Bye.
ba	well that will be nice though.
sv	But still sort of up in that general area of the country
sv	so you can probably see them sometimes.
b	Yeah
b	Yeah
qw	Well, what kind of recycling do you have in your area?
b	Uh huh.
qw	which one is that?
bk	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	Well, our company does some things, all of which I couldn't even tell you about.
sd	Texas Instruments.
b	Yeah .
sd^t	Well, I was just curious as how you got hooked up with this speech type of thing.
b	Oh
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I guess I don't know specifically, except that, for the paper that they want to recycle, they do not want any newspaper, and things like candy wrappers or, that type of thing.
sd	and, even some of those can have plastic tabs on them.
sd	But, they do that
sd	I don't know all the details,
sd	but they're really on top of that.
sd	And there probably some other things that I don't about because we're a real large company.
sd	And I just don't have contact with them.
sd	But in our, city,
sd	and they have initiated a newspaper recycling whereby they pick it up from your alley, one day a week and all you have to do is bundle it.
sd	all around Dallas there are a lot of recycling centers where you can take things, sometimes for money
 +	but most of those are real far away from like where I live at any rate.
^2	Very inconvenient,
b	Yeah,
sv	that wouldn't be so bad.
sd	our grocery store, like yours, will take the, plastic bags
sd	But, you mentioned the, glass type of stuff.
bh	really?
b	Yeah
sd	but he worked for them for like thirty one years.
sd	And he used to travel up there to Knox quite a bit,
sd	and I even did once when I was a child,
bh	really?
b	Yeah,
sd	But, I guess that's about it, you know, as far as what goes on that I know about.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
sv	and like you say, make it, better for companies to do these things, and get involved in it without huge cost to them,
sv	because obviously, no one wants to spend a lot of money, just to deal with trash, you know.
aa	Yeah,
ba	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's true.
b	Uh huh.
sv	we don't need three quarters of, what we get.
sv	that's their marketing.
b	Yeah.
sv	But I don't that it's a big money,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
na	Well, I think we have a neighborhood watch .
sd^r	I think.
sd	well, I know they were going to start one,
qo	How about you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	I'm sure it is.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And mainly it was so when we pulled up, the light would come on,
sd	and we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief,
sd	we thought with that light, you know, it would maybe keep them from doing something to the boat .
b	Uh huh.
sd	We live in, Coppell
b	Uh huh.
ba	no.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah.
na	 definitely.
h	I don't know,
sd	In the dark parking lot .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I don't either.
aa	Yeah,
b	Okay,
b	Okay.
aa	yes,
b	yeah.
b	Sure.
ba	that's great.
sd	Well, I actually take COUNTRY LIVING,
sd^m	Decorating and, getting ideas for a garden.
sd	In fact, right before you called, I was planning my tulips and, putting them on blue print on where I'm going to put them,
sd	so I'm really into that,
sd	but, so, I really get into magazines that are kind of basically into, housing type things, be decorating and gardening and recipes, that kind of stuff.
sd	So I'm pretty much in the same category as what you're looking at.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	I think with that what happens is, it's interesting to read
sv	but you kind of just put the magazine away
aa	Yeah,
sd	but, that's pretty similar,
sd	but I find that with these COUNTRY magazines, I keep going back to them, getting ideas, looking back and saying, Jeez, there was a flower garden in there that I , that I would like to have some ideas, you know
sd	I get a lot of ideas from them.
sd	we're right across from a river,
sd	it just peaked, last week,
b	Yeah,
sd	and, you know, it's, it's fine,
sd	I know that part, probably half their money comes from these people that are saying, Put my ad in your paper and I'll pay you or whatever,
sd	but, there's been some magazines I've looked at,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	I mean, you could go into a store and get bombarded the same way,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Exactly,
sd	But pretty much like I said, the magazines I've had, BETTER HOMES AND GARDEN,
sv	and I thought, Well, I'll give it a try again, because you get tired of one magazine,
ny	yes,
sd	A lot of times, you know, if I got a chance to sit down at my typewriter, I'll go ahead and type out recipes,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	I went through all this,
b	yeah.
sd(^q)	And I just said, Okay, there's one picture in there that,
sd	it's got to have more than that
sd	it's got to have some good ideas
sd	it's got to have everything.
sd	Well, I have a really great one that I make in the summertime because it's cool
sd	And I like that.
sd	And it makes it so much easier,
sd	I don't have to do that.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	I know what you mean.
sd	Now spaghetti's such an easy one.
sd	I do spaghetti a lot.
b	Yeah,
h	Because, I don't know,
b	I guess.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	That's exactly like us, from our church, we just do it,
sd	Well you see all that on T V
sd	well I'm pretty laid back.
sd	And, you know, so I know a lady in my church
o	I guess,
nn	No,
ny	Uh huh,
ba	how exciting.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	yeah,
sd	And I like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me and my husband about what's happened
sd	And, you know we could learn to talk about things
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	But, sometimes if something, is on that they want to watch I leave it on,
b	Yeah.
sd	And if they're going to have other kids over then, then they help.
b	Yeah,
sd	And the kids love to do that.
sd	and like, now one thing I wish I could find a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks, because they love to do that
sd	they like to eat it,
b	Yeah.
 b	Yeah.
sd	sometimes he fixes me breakfast .
b	Yeah,
sd	He's eleven.
b	Uh huh.
ng	not every morning,
sd	during wintertime when they're in school, then I try to vary it so that we only eat that like twice a week or something and then have like, when it's really cold, I even cook oatmeal, Because I like oatmeal
sd	and they like it all right.
sd	And, then sometimes we do something,
b	Yeah,
no	it depends.
sd	You can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray
sd	So you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in, if you have a microwave book,
sd	And let it steam.
sd	and then stir it up.
sd	And it's funny 'cause if I turn them out on to like a plate, for them to take what they want, they don't know I've ever done it in a microwave.
sv	It's really funny,
sd	and yet if they don't ever see it, then it's like, this tastes okay, you know,
b	Yeah
fp	Hi,
sd	I'm in Plano also .
b	Yes,
ba	that was good.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Learned about their basketball team .
sd	Jazz.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd@	That's what I heard. Yeah.
na	I am.
aa	Okay.
sd	Nancy.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm a nurse
sd	I float so that I have no benefits except higher pay for doing that.
sd	So I find that it makes up for what I pay for insurance
na	Right.
b	Yeah,
sd	And then I have my freedom.
na	Well, it is to me.
sd	and I'm just really not interested in all that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	Then I think it makes a big difference.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	yeah.
b	Right.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	well, I guess, retirement, that kind of thing which I don't worry much about ,
sd	I just prefer to worry about today,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	Well, I have an exercise bicycle in my bedroom, but it usually's holding clothes .
b	Right .
sd	Well, that's not why I got it,
qy	is it less boring than the bicycle or not.
qy	You watch T V or something while you do it?
b	Oh.
sd	Well, I do that too.
b	Really.
 b	Yeah.
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Are they kind of expensive.
b	Uh huh.
bh	They do?
sv	Probably the more you pay, though, the better the machine you have.
qy^g	Well, you can believe that anyway, right.
^2	During the year.
b	Yeah,
qy	Do you work at T I?
b	Really.
sd	I live in Arlington.
qw	Where do you live?
nn	No,
b	really.
ar	no,
bk	Oh .
sv	It's more interesting than the treadmill and the bicycle.
ba	my goodness .
sv^t	really have a lot of variety.
 ^2	A school administrator.
sv	Well that could, That would have been interesting.
b	Really,
qy^t	How long is this going to go on, do you know?
sd^t	I don't either .
br	Pardon me?
sd	I don't know.
bh	really.
b	Uh huh.
sd^t	so they wanted anybody,
ba	Well, that's interesting.
sd^t	I had no idea that was just for the employees,
sd^t	I kept hanging up on them for days, until my husband told me what it was .
sd^t	I didn't know.
b	Oh.
b	my.
h^t	I wish I had that booklet here.
sd^t	well, they have some watches that look really nice.
sd^t	I haven't quite figured that out.
sd(^q)^t	Says when we have enough calls from you, you will receive in the mail a numbered certificate for your calls and explanation how to redeem, for gifts.
b	Oh .
nn	no,
aa	Yeah,
sd	I'm going crazy,
sd^t	It's got one of those,
 sd^t	He brought it home.
b	yeah,
sd^t	Silver plated bowls and stuff. There's a lot of stuff, it's a big booklet.
nn	no.
 sd^t	well, it's been fun,
b	Yeah.
sd	I went to Metropolitan a couple of years ago,
sv	That's a very common experience.
b	No.
ba	That's funny .
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	well.
ba	tell me about it,
sd	putting two of us through, isn't he lucky.
sd	Well, me, I'm going, and my daughter Janet in Austin.
sd	U T A right here.
sd	Well, I'm, going to be certified as an English teacher teach English as a second language.
 %	that's ,
bf	Hard.
fe	no.
 b@	Really. Really,
qo	how are the other ones.
b	yeah,
b	Really.
b	Really.
sd	I really ought to take those quickly while I still remember some.
sd	I know. .
b	Oh .
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
sd	Well I certainly haven't thought much about this
ny	Yes,
sd	And I'm trying to figure out whether I'm remembering wrong or whether that's by state.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
 +	too, or whatever.
sv	in terms of doing away with the unanimous jury, I guess I, would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in the trial system.
sv	But, and, I, I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with just a bare majority.
b	Yeah.
 b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I know it is where I work.
sv	I suspect that's a benefit of a bigger company.
 aa	yeah,
aa	I'll let you go ahead and start, yeah.
sv@	You know, I think that's changed just in the last generation. Just in the last little while. Because I know my father in law doesn't do that much, of that kind of stuff
sd	but my husband is wonderful.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	They're not accepting that anymore.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	but I also think it is important for them to be with the children.
sv	I, I think there are some things that women just are designed to do better than men.
sv	And there are some things that men are designed to do better than women.
sv	I don't think it should ever be totally equal.
sv	we're not made like that.
ba	That's right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	One of the frustrations that I have with the way things have developed is that, and for some it's not a problem, it's difficult for a family to make a living on one income.
sv	It can be done,
sv	but you make sacrifices.
b	Yeah.
na	I'm a contract person at T I in fact involved with, Data Switchboard
qy	and, do you work for T I?
bk	Uh huh.
sd	you sound very young like just out of college .
^h	I'm trying to think,
qy	and, have you seen that one?
sv	That was excellent.
sd	but we both just thoroughly, you know enjoyed it, just really liked it
^h	and, I'm trying to think,
sd	I've gone blank.
sd	we have not seen that,
sd	I haven't seen that one.
 bh	Were you.
sd	My husband doesn't enjoy the shows as much going to them,
sd	and so we watch a lot of them, you know, at home as they come out,
ny	Yes,
bh	Did you?
sd	I'm a real big Patrick Swayze fan
sd	and, I was really disappointed in it,
sv	it was more of a love story
sd	and, so I was really disappointed in that because I like him real well.
sd	We just got through watching one with, is it Claude Van Damme yeah, and, enjoyed it,
sd	I can't think what the name of
sd	and we enjoyed that,
ny	Yes.
qy	Wasn't that excellent?
b	Yeah,
sd	I kept thinking about it, you know,
aa	No.
sv	it was excellent,
sv	and, I think he made the movie,
b	Yeah,
qr	Is it Anthony Perkins or Anthony Hopkins?
b^m	Hopkins,
b	I know
aa	No,
sv	and that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats,
ng	he won't go see that,
sd	I went with, our daughter so, you know, saw it with her, and, enjoyed it.
sd	My all time favorite is WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S.
qy	Did you see it?
sd	I've seen it, you know,
sd	and, we just love it,
b	yes,
sd	My husband liked that
sd	he's a big Gene Wilder fan,
b	Uh huh,
ny	Yeah,
ny	Uh huh,
b	Yes,
b	Yeah,
na	BLAZING SADDLES.
sd	that's my husband's all time favorite, I think.
qy	Did you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	well I used to be more into crafts, when I was younger, like high school stuff.
sd	and, I've learned how to crochet,
sd	I used to play trombone .
sd	I don't know if that was a,
qw	But, what are some other things you enjoy?
b	Uh huh
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	cool.
ba	wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you ever,
b	Yeah.
sv	That's great that he has a lot of hobbies and stuff.
b	Oh .
b	Yeah.
qy	does he ever, refinish furniture or anything like that?
b	Uh huh
sv	But, it's nice to have it when you're done,
sd	So, I've done that once
no	I don't remember.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I remember it took me a long time,
^h	But, I don't know.
nn	No,
fc	Have a good day now.
fc	Bye .
b	Uh huh.
na	Well, just really the last couple of days since the, U N debate or whatever you want to call it that, voted on whether there was going to be a cease fire.
 sv	they had, I don't know if you call it standout or whatever
sv	So, I guess, from what I understand the thing could just it could just, they could take off at any moment without, you know, you know, any local, you know, congressional effort or anything else because, you know, it's not really settled yet.
ng	Not yet.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	And, he came within a quarter of an inch of going, to Saudi,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
 +	and part of it Iraq and part of it something else, you know,
sv	So, the country of, of Kuwait really doesn't make just a whole lot of sense except that it is an excepted place, you know
sv	it's like any other country, you know,
sv	And it's just that this was an excuse, you know, to make some noise .
sv	now we are a legitimate player, in the game over there, you know,
sv	But, we are now a legitimate player in the, in the game because we came in with a certain amount of force and you know we defeated,
 sv	that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit.
sv	because they'd go in and they'd win something.
sv	and then they could call the shots for the, you know, period of time until the next strong man came up and, you know and caused problems.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	that's the, that's the big thing, you know,
 sv	we're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out.
sv	they gave the guys, the power and the material and told them to go do it and they did it. You know, got in and got out.
h	I'm not sure,
sv	And whether the United Nations,
sv	seems to be exactly what's happening right at the moment.
aa^r	No,
sv	I mean, the only way that you're going to have peace over there, if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them,
sv	So that's a little rough, you know,
b	Oh .
fc	You too.
 fc^m	Bye bye.
o	Okay.
sd	We have a, four bedroom split brick home in Richardson actually.
sd	And, we bought it back in about nineteen seventy three.
aa	Yes .
ny	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
sd@	I know where that is. Yeah. * should this be two slash units?
b	Yes,
sv	those are lovely.
b	Oh.
b	Yes.
qy	Have you, found in talking to your neighbors that your utilities are quite a bit higher with those high ceilings?
qy	Are they?
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
qw	Well, how many bedrooms do you have in your home?
bk	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That's a pretty good size room.
ba	That's neat.
ba	Well, it sounds like a real nice one.
b	Right.
bk	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	And I would imagine that you have found that the homes down here are, a much better value down here, aren't they, than they are,
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
sd	That's interesting because I've heard so many people down here say that they don't feel like the quality of the homes, you know, are that good down here.
ba	so that's interesting.
ba	Well, that's good.
sd	Well, I know as I said our house is about seventeen years old
sd	And, you know, it is with the, you know, two children growing up and now three grandsons roaming through it, all the time.
sd	and we like our neighborhood.
sd	and the majority of the people, you know, keep up the neighborhood.
sv	And that's very important
sd	But we bought back when housing was so low,
sd	then it started jumping by leaps and bounds.
sd	It seems to have leveled off and actually dropped back down a little bit,
sd	but we're still fine.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yes .
sv	Your pricing.
 +	improves, I think the housing will go up.
 sv	You know. Right now there's a lot on the market for sale because of people having lost their jobs, and everything
sv	so you know, that keeps prices down and value down
sv	and I'm sure the packs , or
ba	That's right .
ba^r	That's right .
sd	Well, I just got back from taking my little girl to her Brownie meeting,
sd	and they've been recycling at their school.
sd	But they were filled with beer cans .
sd	and I hated to take a big old sack, I mean, I mean, like a lawn bag full of them.
sd	we'll just taking them up there and put them in the bins anyway.
sd	They had tickets at their school that they recycle either newspapers or cans,
t3	Okay,
b	Yeah,
sd	So they're getting into it.
aa	It's not bad, yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	So in each of the dorms you have a place for that?
ba	That's really good.
qy^d	For the dorm,
qw	And what do they do with it?
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I graduated from college in nineteen seventy two,
sd	And we were just, not aware that this was a problem, that we ever would need to recycle.
sd	Of course, you just threw it away.
sd	So, a little different.
sd	The whole school, you know,
sd	A little boy that had died of leukemia, I think,
sd	And his mother is carrying this on.
sd	you don't have to join it as a group or anything, I don't guess.
qy	Do you all have Target stores up there?
bk^r	No.
sd	That's a department store.
sd	Kind of like K Mart except it's a little better than what K Mart sells, I think.
qy^d	So, you're not having it picked up at your houses or anything.
sd	Now in some of the towns around us, they're already picking up the newspapers.
sd	Well, they're doing that here, too, now that I think about it . Once every so many weeks,
sd	And, I think that's all they're picking up.
b	Yeah,
qy	Do you all have can banks?
qy	No?
sd	a big old bin,
sd	But they had one that I was putting my stuff in,
qy^d	But they don't give you for the other.
b	Uh huh.
b	I don't know.
sd	I'm not that dedicated.
sd	Me, too.
ny	Yeah,
sd	they're taking our milk cartons and our plastic coke bottles there, too.
qy^g	That's pretty good isn't it.
sd	It sounds like it,
qy	You mean where you sack your own groceries.
sd	And I don't want to go with those canvas bags right now, I'm sorry.
sd	And, you know, they go all the time.
sd	And they had this little bitty old teeny refrigerators.
sv	That's why.
sd	Well, that's why I did what I did.
aa	definitely.
^g	Right?
sv	I think they're maybe going to give us a state income tax.
sd	I'm not looking forward to it,
sd	Well, it's going to hit us.
h	And I don't know,
sv	We have too many administrators in some of these big districts.
qy^t	But other than that. Well, can you think of anything else we need to talk about.
sd	Me, either.
qo	What about people from, Pennsylvania.
ny	Uh huh.
qy	Have you thought about that?
sv	Probably a lot more civilized, more, refined than a lot of the people would be down here.
sd	I would hope so,
b	No.
sd	Well I've never,
b	Yeah,
o	Shboom.
t3	is what you say it is, Holly? in Israel.
sd	So she's into this.
nn	Huh uh.
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
nd	Well, I work,
sd	and I work with another C P A who just started his own practice
sd	and I work with him a couple days a week
sd	and so when I go to his office or to other clients' offices, then I'll dress up
sd	but otherwise it's great being at home in jeans or shorts or whatever .
sd	So that makes it pretty nice.
sd	and, it seemed like I was wearing a suit every day, just about.
b	Right.
b	Right,
sd	So it's, It's, it's very nice.
b	Gosh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	So you all are waiting for that .
b	Right.
sd	I mean, we had a few cool days, this month,
sd	So, I mean people are still wearing shorts
sd	so you start you know, breaking out a coat at that time,
sd	but, that lasts, you know, for a few months .
nn	No.
sd	I think it was one of those things where, it's not like someone came out and said you can't wear them.
sd	It was one of those understood things that you just, you know, either wore, you know, a dress or,
nn	Not,
sd	Most people didn't.
sd	Sometimes, like the secretaries might
sd	but even then you didn't see them wearing slacks too much.
b	Uh huh.
sv	You know, I think it's one of those things where it's not viewed upon as being professional.
aa	Yeah
sv	And it's the men that make the rules .
o	But, no,
sd	So it's nice with me working at home because I can wear pants.
sd	no one can see me unless I'm, you know, g ,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
ad	If you want to go first, go ahead.
aa	Yeah,
sv	Because if you look at most corporations, there isn't a woman, you know, that's on the board of directors, or that type of thing,
sv	There may be a few, but very incidental.
sd	And I really think that it will be a long time, probably, before we see that.
sv	It's mostly, you know,
sv	You know, it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living,
sd	So I think that we did come a long way in the sense that you know, like you say, we're out in the labor force, but I think we've lost something too.
b	Yeah.
sd	That's what I mean,
sv	If you are not going to have a family, then that's fine,
sd	And I think it's great, but if you have a family, I think you owe the family a responsibility.
 sv	And to have children and just get a day care or someone to take care of it, and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff, you know I think that the mother and the child lose,
sv	and I think that's why there is so many problems you know, with kids today,
sv	because they don't have the family roots anymore.
aa	definitely.
aa	That's right,
sv	That's very true, but then they shouldn't have a family.
sd	That's what I'm saying, you know,
sd	like basically there's contraceptives and all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies.
sv	There is no need to have children if you don't want them.
sv	That's fine,
sd	And I agree with that,
h	Well, I shouldn't say they are not going to be a good parent.
sv	Like they won't have that,
aa	Right,
sv	It's not like something that they really wanted.
sd	I'm not sorry I had any of them,
sd	You know, I had to work, but I tried to make it as painless as possible.
sd	In fact, at one time I worked as a second shift,
sd	And I wasn't there at supper time or bed time,
sd	So we were,
sd	And that's why I said that's it,
sd	And I worked that shift for eleven years.
b	Yeah.
sd	Just so that my kids would have me at home.
sv	You know, and I feel that's very important,
sv	So I mean in the sense that we've come a long way,
sv	And, I really think that like after the second World War when women went to work in factories and all that, that was like out of necessity, because the men weren't here anymore.
sv	But then it got to be a point where they got some independence.
aa	Exactly.
sd	And I notice today kids, you know,
 sd	And we had to walk before we had a car.
sv	And now kids at sixteen years old, they have their birthday,
sd	And to me, it's like we've lost our values in this country.
sv	We really have,
sv	You will take better care of that,
 sv	And it's just like college too,
aa	Of course.
b	Sure,
 b	Sure,
aa	Yeah,
sv	you know, you are going to find out for yourself,
sv	You know, there is no harm in that, whereas sometimes you can't even get that from a kid, you know. Just attention, you know.
sd	But really,
b	Yeah,
sv	Well, I still think people have a choice.
h	I don't know.
sv	I mean no one has said for sure, you know.
b	Yes,
b	Yeah.
sd	Because I mean you as an individual, what you do, that to me is your business.
aa	Exactly,
ny	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, about the same I dress for school.
sd	 although I do, a lot of,
sd	I am a speech pathology major
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
qy^d	Even the farmers.
bk	wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
sv@	un , un , unfortunately. Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
sd	and sometimes that really disappoints me, when I see in other economic areas like in Kentucky.
sd	You know, people just don't have that
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	Certainly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	yeah
ny	Yes,
qy	Do you?
b	Uh huh,
qy	Does he really?
 b	Uh huh.
ba	wo ,
aa	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	He's one of the few, Black quarterbacks that there are.
b	Uh huh.
no	I don't know,
sv	But, I think they're still such a young team I think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential, that it did when ever Bradshaw was playing.
sv	Or, if they even reach that potential again, you know, they may never reach that again.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
sd	I don't know.
sd	Shooting for one for the thumb now is what they were saying.
sd	But basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now,
sv	I think Mike Webster was left
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
nn	No,
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah,
qw	Well who would you say is your favorite player, or has ever been your favorite player?
ny	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	you know, that's really funny,
sd	And, at one time I could name all the players on the Steelers, you know.
sd	but, even when Bradshaw was playing, I don't know, I didn't particularly care for him,
sd	I thought he was kind of cocky or something.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
sv	I mean they were good,
sd	But I thought, you know, well I just didn't really care for either one of them.
sd	today, my favorites out of those guys were probably, Lambert, Ham, and, Stallworth and Swan.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
aa	yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	you know, and to me he's just so big and fat,
sv	he doesn't even look like he's in shape.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
qy	would you say that you have a fav ,
b	Yeah,
b	No,
aa	Yes he is,
 sv	I, I enjoy watching him also.
qo	What about, Marino?
sv@	I think he'll get better as he gets older. Because he well wa , he was the youngest quarterback there was, wasn't he?
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's true,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I'm sure arthritis sets in with them,
 +	you know.
b	Right,
b	Uh huh,
sv	but, they're retired, you know,
b	yeah,
b	Yeah,
sv	Holy smokes, that doesn't seem like very long.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yes,
sv	I say yes.
aa	Yes.
sv	It's wonderful.
b	Well, .
sv	and we have so many people in the United States that we spend,
sd	insurance didn't cover a penny.
aa	Yes,
b	Yeah,
sv	if you're healthy it's fine,
b	Yeah,
sd	and ninety percent of the doctors you would choose are on that list.
ny	Yeah.
sd	McCullum is.
sd	McCullum is.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, but that's that's a screw up in an appointment, you know,
sd	I'm going back to the days when I was pregnant
sd	and I had two doctors,
sd	but when I delivered Ronnie, he was not on call
sd	the other guy delivered him
sd	and, you know, if, I go to Townsend
sd	he's got a new partner.
ar	Well, no,
b	No.
b	No.
b	Yeah.
sd	and at the same token there is something,
sd	and he can get free medical care, but he has to go to the city hospital instead of seeing David and so again, you know,
sd	we went through Ronnie's home tonight,
sd	So, there are programs, you know, if you get on Medicare or Medicaid or one of those,
b	Yeah.
sd	That's what I read.
sd	well, I have, seen DANCES WITH WOLVES, which is probably the best movie that I have seen lately.
sd	So we do get a lot of videos that we bring in,
sd	I hear that is really good, but I have not seen it yet.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
ba	cute.
ba	dear.
b	Uh huh.
^2	and he hears them or something
qw	Who wins?
 ba	great,
sv	I think.
b	Yeah.
sv	that is taking the middle of the afternoon.
b	Uh huh.
 sv	which does not make,
sv	but DANCES WITH WOLVES did not seem to have anything added.
b	yeah.
aa	Absolutely.
 sd	they do not have to keep making up stuff if they want to make something good.
sd	I hate sequels too.
sv	Usually if a movie is good, once is enough .
b	Right.
 sd	And I thought, you know, that would not have been the sort of thing I would have wanted my children to see at that age, I mean when they were young.
 sd	which was a,
sd	So, but I do not know that I have seen any of the, sequels to that.
b@	Yes, uh huh.
 b	Oh.
aa	Yeah.
sv	Well, the whole movie is kind of far fetched.
sv	But, I mean the whole idea behind it is far fetched.
sv	not too often .
sv	That has gotten to be a whole camp idea now though, you know.
sv	It's funny.
b	Yeah.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	It was good.
sv	It was very good.
b	Uh huh.
b	No kidding.
sd	I did not realize that.
sd	I teach in school,
sd	And I wondered if maybe he was patterned after him.
h	I do not know,
sd	so, it was kind of fun.
h	I do not know for sure,
sd	But he is still alive
qy	And that book, have you ever read that book? INVISIBLE MAN.
qy^d	INVISIBLE MAN by Ralph Ellison.
 sv	It is an incredible book.
 %	the,
sv	So it could easily have been patterned after him.
 sv	I just thought the, author could have been patterned after that,
fc	Okay.
fc	Very good.
sd	Well, I guess a lot of the,
sd	I guess I want to see if there's anything I really want to see there, so I don't end up watching the, prime time on some of the standard channels as much, I tend to go to my premium channels first,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	Monday night's pretty good with MURPHY BROWN and DESIGNING WOMEN.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	The only night we tend to watch some of that is on Sunday nights, starting fairly late, like I'm talking ten o'clock and maybe toward midnight.
sd	and there's a variety.
sv	They're real good,
sd	And I'm amazed sometimes what I see on there.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ny	Yeah,
ny	yeah,
sv	I mean, some of the,
ny	yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	It is Friday,
ba	wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah
bh	Really?
b	Yeah.
sd	And, I've done various things.
sd	I guess the last thing I took to anybody to have done was on my wife's car, when we went in for inspection.
sd	it didn't quite pass.
sd	So we had to have,
sd	And they had to do some adjustments on that and of course it had never been adjusted so they had to pull it off and pull all the plugs out, to get to it.
ny	Yeah,
sd	we ran into some problems with, having them work on that carburetor.
sd	and it rubbed a notch in that.
 sv	little things like that, that really start to aggravate you.
b	Uh huh.
b@	Sure. Sure,
b	Sure.
sd	anything that that, that's in a, gets to be an assembly line type operation,
sv	and they miss things.
sd	But, it, it's, it's real stressful to try to find anybody that I think's going to do me right. and, you know, have an idea of what's going on.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Well, yeah.
sv	If you don't have the special tools or,
sd	I don't have a forty thousand dollar diagnostic tester sitting in my garage, you know.
sd	So obviously if my car starts missing or something like that, it's almost impossible to track that down any more without a diagnostics.
sd	But the tools and the space to do it, that can be a big problem if it's under carriage or something like that.
sd	that was the biggest thing when I did, the heater core in my T Bird.
sd	and the only reason I did it,
b	Yeah,
sd	You just open the door and pop it out.
aa	Yeah.
sd	well it was about seven hours labor.
sd	So it was going to run about four hundred dollars or so.
sd	And they looked it over and they, they thought they could patch it up a little bit, you know, and what not.
b	Yeah.
sd	So, they did a little patch on it,
o	hey,
sd	It was about a week before I finally through.
b	Yeah.
bh	really?
nn	No,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
ba	You bet.
sd	And it had broken loose enough to where if it got hot,
sd	and just normal driving didn't do it.
sd	It was real aggravating,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Well, yeah.
sd	it, it can, it can save a lot of time and trouble.
sd	several years ago a radio broke in my car
 sd	and I never,
sd	I don't really know what too many of the most popular songs are unless, you know, they're in the news or something .
sd	But, so I tend to listen to some of the older songs that were popular back when I was paying attention.
 sd	And then I like some classical music and some of the pieces that have been around a while.
 sd	I haven't paid much attention to most of the current music.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's true.
 b	Uh huh.
b	No.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Yes,
sd	I never really listened to it because you know, I prefer to have I guess, an established pattern of music to listen to.
sd	back a long time ago, when the rap music first came out it was kind of a novelty, and I listened to some of it,
sv	now that there's just a million rap groups
sd	so you know, I'm not attracted to that at all,
sv	But, you know, if you go two or three years without having that,
sd	it really changed my life style and kept me from just having you know, easy access to current music,
sd,qy^g	But we don't have a C D yet, do you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	and they were really expensive
b	Uh huh,
ba	Sure
 %	w ,
 +	without, making them less expensive.
sd	I haven't even priced them.
ba	That is awful .
b	Uh huh.
o	Take our time.
sd	Well, I can't imagine,
sv	so C D s won't be nearly as handy.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
ad	Enjoy it.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
sd	but I'm satisfied to just have what I've been used to, not have to think about the great financial sacrifice that that would be, to suddenly try to switch over to all C D s or something.
sd	But I know one thing that has colored my music choice is when we had children, I really started to think about what kind of television programs I was watching, and what kind of music I was listening to and
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yes,
sd	so he has a lot of all different kinds of music,
sd	And I think that's really good because they're learning to like all different kinds
sd	He plays the,
sd	I never had known anyone to play one before.
sd	But it's kind of like a small tuba but it's not the kind that sits up on your shoulder.
sd	But it's a cross between a tuba and an, and, you know, a horn.
sd	So he plays that and a little bit of piano
sd	and he thinks that would be good for the kids .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 nd	Well, I don't.
sd	I have little children.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	Well, we had a dog before we moved here.
b	Okay,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
ba	Definitely.
sd	That experience was awful .
b	Uh huh.
t3	what you doing ?
 b	Oh.
sd	Well, a lot of times now when you buy them from like the S P C A or from the humane societies or whatever, their adoption includes their spaying.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	My husband that's one thing he hated was our cat used to sleep with us.
sd	Our dog wasn't interested in even coming in our room,
ny	Uh huh.
 sd	So, I guess probably if we get another animal it probably wouldn't be a cat even though I love cats.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and so then she crawls on the carpet
 +	it's just really awful
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well. That is like my favorite hobby .
ny	So, yeah,
sd	and, So, } when I can that is what I do .
sd	Well, I am not sure.
ny	Yeah.
ng	Well, no that is exciting.
sd	You know, it loses that newness,
sd	and I just love it all.
qo	So how about you?
b	Uh huh.
ba	no .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, it would be a lot fun.
sd	My daughter is, a twirling champion
sd	and she had to perform over there in Turin
sd	and they gave us all the wrong directions
sd	and there were just two of us.
sd	We sat there,
sd	We finally followed some kids who told us where to get off.
sd	and we lucked out
sd	But, that was our experience
sd	But where we were, it certainly was
sd	But it was very far away on a bus.
sd	So, you know, it was really, it was interesting.
sv	And you always have a fun experience
ny	Uh huh.
nn	No,
sd	Our friends live like an hour outside of England, like Ash, around there.
o	Okay.
sd	Well, Larry, my last one, unfortunately, was an expensive one because I had a brand new Lincoln Town Car
sd	That was a huge repair bill.
ng	I know,
nd	Well, I travel a lot,
no	so I don't know,
nn	No,
sd	they didn't go off.
nn	No,
ny	Yes.
b	Yes.
sd	It was
sd	but it did, right eleven thousand dollars in damage.
sd	when my twenty four months is up on this car, I'm getting rid of this car.
fe	My golly.
ba	I understand.
ba	I understand.
b	Sure.
b@	Sure. .
nn	No,
sd	so, I usually drive a car for three years,
 +	and anyway, and so, but last couple of cars I've only driven for two years,
ng	Well, no sir.
sd^e	no problem at all.
aa	Yes,
sd	I'm like a traveling salesman,
b	Yes
bh	Is that right?
sd	Well, I know it's hard for young people to think about giving up you know, fr , their carefree years
sd	but people that I have known that have done that, like from other countries, especially, from Germany and Finland, they have such a better, more mature, outlook on life
sv	and I think they're better people because of it,
sv	they're much more responsible.
sd	they're encouraged to do that, missionary work,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I mean, teenagers in our country are kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and, and things like that
sd	and I think that it would help people to become, less self centered, and to be more responsible when you're out on your own thinking less of your own needs but, of other people.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	no.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yes.
sd	the people that I've known like from Germany and Finland that have done that they do military service which, you know, I don't exactly recommend ,
sd	but still they have benefited from it.
sd	And, you know, although I wouldn't want it to make people to go off to the military voluntarily
sd	and they are just a lot more mature, than the average student
b	Uh huh.
aa	Well, that's right.
sv	and they do a lot of things to themselves that we really don't want our young people to be doing
b	Yeah.
sd	like in our church, it is, your free to do that or not
sd	you're encouraged to do it because, you know, it helps you,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And they're preoccupied with, drinking.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's true.
ba	That's really true.
b	Yeah.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I have seen a big change, I think, in high school kids that my relatives , and friends, that, I know when I was in high school I had an idea of what I really wanted to do with what I was going to study
sd	and at least I had some interest in,
sv	And they don't have a goal,
sv	They're just looking what's going to pay the biggest cash.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
sv	There's just too many people.
sv	You know, if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country, but if you're just doing it because you think that's the best way to, be rich.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That's kind of sad.
fc	Well, I guess I better go.
fc	Well, good luck to you.
fc	Thanks.
sd	Well, we don't actually have a budget per se.
sd	and occasionally it actually balances, .
sd	every dollar we, every dollar we charge is a mile for our frequent flier mileage.
sd	It's a real good deal actually, if you charge a lot.
sd	So what we'll do is,
na	Right.
sd	And so what we do is, anytime we do or make or charge something, we write it out as if we wrote a check.
sd	And then at the end of the month all the money to covered already.
sd	It keeps us hopping.
b	Huh uh.
sv	Well, you know, you know, you know, what's always good is sort of a for savings , where they just take money out of you're pay.
sd	We did that for awhile where,
sd	I'm a graduate student.
b	really.
bk	okay.
sd	but my wife has a real job.
b	Yeah
sd	And it goes directly to another account, at an entirely different bank, that we don't have access to so easily,
b	Oh.
b	Gee.
b	Right.
ba	God.
sd	I got lucky.
ba	Wow.
ba@	That was great . With the money savings there. That's good.
b	Right.
sd	I pay what I think is a lot of money to go to a karate class, you know.
b	Right.
sd	But she does her nails.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah
qy^g	well, it's for your benefit though, right.
ba	, so that's helpful.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's great.
ba	wow.
sv	that's the killer, two apartments,
ba	Wow.
ba	Eventually, right.
qy	Have you been married for long?
ba	wow.
ba	wow.
b	Yeah.
sd	So I say if she wants to go out and buy something, I never argue with her, because she's real good at, you know, sort of .
 b	Yeah.
ba	Had some money in her pocket, yeah.
ba	That's right.
sv	You know, you don't even think about it if it's gone.
b	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	We've had some sort of major emergencies come up, you know, where,
sd	we had an ice storm up here, recently, where I mean, it was horrible.
sd	I mean, half the city owned trees .
ny	Yeah.
aa	Exactly.
sd	We had to our backyard tremendous willow tree that just fortunately,
sd	Plus, we went with a friend,
sd	and then we had a car expense like that same week.
b	Right.
qy	Well, do you have time to read the paper in the morning?
sv	You know, a lot of people don't take newspapers at all.
sd	and then, well, we've been taking the TIMES HERALD for ages
qy	did you, did you hear what Schwartzkopf had to say about, Pete Arnett, and, the news coverage?
sd	Well any, you know, TIME magazine and even the news that,
sd	and we also hit the Garland, GARLAND DAILY NEWS,
sd	but I think what's interesting is that there, that as difficult as it is, or as much as they try, they put some bias,
b	Yes.
b	Yeah,
na	I listen to K R L D, and, K L I F, the news talk radio.
sd	And I actually listen to C N N radio.
sd	It's on eleven ninety.
sd	Well, when I go to work I listen.
b	Yeah.
sv	if you're around the home, though and, and can watch T V and read the paper, the problem is that about twenty minutes of news radio, or thirty minutes is
sv	that's what's interesting is the C N N,
sd	That and ninety eight point seven, I'm eclectic approach.
na	Well, I watch channel five
sd	That has to do with the weather reporting.
sd	Well the, Channel eight when they came here thirteen, fourteen years ago, Dave Fox and Tracy Rowlett came together, from Oklahoma City
sd	and apparently channel eight was way down
sd	I think that adds to the diversity,
sd	there, I know, you know, John Wylie Price,
b	Yeah,
sv	But I think that from a justice standpoint, because we have the option of not watching that station.
sv	I'm totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs
 sd	and I think that, Dallas, it turns out, though from what I understand, has quite good,
 sv	And, there for a few days and watch the news and think Dallas really does have quite good news.
sd	Course he pumping his own ,
qw	Where'd you move from?
b	Yeah.
sv	It is interesting though,
sd	and shortly after we got here fourteen years ago
sv	and that's interesting.
 sv	And I think, if we remember that they're out after the ratings.
sd	Well, it's like the Dale Hansen on channel eight sometimes a little too cutesy
qy^t	have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes?
aa	Okay,
fc	Goodnight.
sd	mainly, the books I read are, business related, or self improvement.
sd	I've got a, small company on the side that I do things with,
sd	I've got a, small distributorship,
sd	I, sell a, healthy cookie on the side.
sd	And, I have a few health food stores that I send it to.
sd	so I can get a deal from the ma , from the supplier,
sd	and then I distributed them
sd^r	A drinking water business,
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Sounds like it.
ng	I haven't really read anything like that in, in years.
sd	and I had my own garden
sd^r	About ten years younger,
sv	And, the problem that I've had in the past with, my children growing up and moving out of the house and still having three left at home, out of the five,
sd	I've tried to devote more time to them and trying to get them interested in reading more and spending more time at the library
sd	but, they, they do read them.
ny	Yeah,
sd	There's a couple called,
sd	and, there's a book called LIFE EXTENSIONS,
bk	Okay.
sd	Dirk Pearson and,
sd^r	LIFE EXTENSIONS.
ny	yeah,
sd	I saw him probably seven years ago, on Johnny Carson show
sd	and, I was pretty impressed.
sd	and then he embarked on this, vitamin treatment
sd	and at the age of thirty two, I think it was, his, heart was that of a fourteen year old
sd	and all the rest of his organs were you know, all tested out greatly below his actual age.
sv	I mean, you know, she appeared to me to be very petite
sv	and, it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that give you the strength,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes.
b	Yeah,
sd	I've read a lot of things, since I got involved in the water business back in eighty three,
sd	and it's amazing that the legislation they have, for food that doesn't apply to water,
sv	and, the basics premise is that if water was a food you know, they wouldn't be able to sell it to you through your pipes because it's toxic . chlorine,
sv^r	It's toxic.
qy^d	I don't know if your on city water,
sv	they know that,
sv	The problem is that I've read books that, have proven that there is a link between the ingestation of chlorine and arteriosclerosis, which is heart attack,
sv*	and if you look at the history of hear attacks, heart attacks were nonexistent prior to nineteen twenty, / * typo hear > heart
sd	and we started doing, large quantities of chlorination of water starting around, where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
^h	It depends, a lot of things were thought that, as,
sv	Well, as far as tangible benefits go I would say that, health insurance of all forms is probably my next most important concern.
sv	I feel that a company that can provide good health benefits such as health care, dental and vision as well as good long term and short term disability plans, goes a long way toward satisfying my needs.
b	Right.
sv	you really don't realize how important they are until you find yourself on the other side of the fence without them and having to cover your own medical
b	Yeah,
b	Right.
sv	I suspect that it just disappeared.
b	Right.
sd	I work for a little start up company here in Pittsburgh called Trans Ark.
qy	Have you heard of them?
sd	we do, distributive system software for Unix based workstations
ny	yes,
ny	Yes.
b	So, yeah,
qy	So, did Ryder get out of the business?
b	Right.
sv	So that the merger pretty much ended the whole thing.
b	Yeah,
sv	But when the company goes bankrupt, I mean, they're just cut off completely
sv	and that's exceedingly expensive.
b	Right.
aa	It's definitely excessive.
aa	True.
b	Yeah,
sd	I mean, there's no dental or vision.
sd	And the short term disability policy is a ninety day policy
sv	And, you know, of course, they can use the excuse
b	Right.
sv	Well that certainly doesn't help matters any.
sd	Well, I own the company.
sd	I'm the president and C E O of the company.
sv	So, I guess, I determine what the benefits are .
qw	so what are you asking me,
sv	I'd say in today's economy, besides basic benefits, such as, health insurance and life insurance and some type of retirement plan I'd say that, most of the employees, that we have really like a profit sharing plan.
sv	They like to participate in the profits of the company like they're, you know,
b	Right.
aa	Right.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yes.
qy^d	You said you retired,
sv	and, it's real important, that their benefit plans that they get from their companies and from their work where they were, that, that it take care of them.
sd	Well, we, considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a salary is tie, a percentage, of business that a person would participate and bring into the company.
nn	No,
b	Right
sd	and then we have financial planners,
sd	And, so, we're thinking about paying them, instead of a percentage on salary, paying them a percentage on the business they handle.
sv(^q)	see the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they're the assistant to, or that they usually have several people they report to you know, that they work together with it encourages them not to, complain when they realize that they get a part of the action based on their efforts and not based on being sitting back saying, well make me do it.
sv(^q)	See, we don't want anybody around here that says make me do it.
sv	I think most people want to be, lack of better terminology, they want to be self employed,
sd	that's what we have.
ba	Good grief.
sd	Well, I wonder if they couldn't just provide, interim health insurance for people who are between jobs like that.
b	Uh huh.
br	You mean the, the employers?
b	Uh huh.
^2	Because everybody's competing for jobs.
sv	Well, I used to think that universal health insurance was probably the right thing to do.
sd	and, he told me that there're a lot of counts against the Canadian system, which is basically the one people are talking about for here.
sd	I don't understand the arguments, exactly.
sd	I mean we're on a private insurance plan right now,
sd	actually I have my own business,
sd	our health insurance is through my wife's employer,
sd	It's always so confusing.
b	Uh huh.
b	Well, yeah.
sv	but of course that is restricted choice,
sv	I think it has to do with the, the, attempt to limit cost, doesn't it
sv	you have to recognize that if you're going to have the very best health care possible and, available on demand whenever and wherever you want it, then it's going to be expensive.
sv	And if you want to pay less, then you're going to have to settle for a health system that is not quite that, lavish.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sv	Well, if they're smart.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	I think the last one that we actually went to go see,
sd	and they loved the dogs,
sd	we went with some friends of ours,
sd	and he's going through a stage right now where he's kind of afraid of dogs barking if he can hear them and can't see them
sd	and he did real good through the whole movie except the part where the dogs are sending the message, you know, that the, the puppies are missing
sd	and it shows the town,
b	Yeah,
sd	but after that he did fine.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	I loved that movie.
sv	Probably gives them ideas of what they want to do,
b	Yeah.
qy^d	Wasn't that good.
bd	no.
sd	Well, I like to watch the movies,
sd	and we rent them
sd	and now we did go see HOME ALONE at the dollar movie
sd	And we did also,
sd	it's a funny movie.
aa	That's true.
sv	I hope he stays cute not spoiled, you know,
sv	you get to where the money goes to their heads or goes to something, you know,
sv	they grow up too fast,
sd	You know, I'd like to see GREEN CARD,
sd	I'd like to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
b	Yeah.
sd	And see, I've had somebody tell me that REGARDING HENRY, you know, the Harrison Ford movie is supposed to be really good,
sd	I'd like to see that.
sd	I've heard that's good,
sd	So I think there's a bunch of good movies coming out.
sd	my V C R went on the blitz about two weeks ago,
b	Yeah.
^h	You know, I look at those,
ng	and, I don't buy them,
sv	but I just have a problem paying twenty five dollars for a movie that I can go down and rent for a dollar .
sv	You know, they don't last that long.
ba	that's pretty good,
b	Yeah.
sd	or I can make a copy you know,
sd	and I have a copy that's just about worn out.
sd	She's four
sd	so she just thinks the grou ,
sd	Now, I'm not pregnant, mind you,
sd	she's planning ahead,
b	Yeah.
ba	I know.
sd	Now, see, I remember thinking it's a wonderful movie,
sd	I don't remember the language.
qy	Was it bad?
sd	and see my kids weren't in the roo ,
b	Huh.
b	Yes.
b	Yes.
b	Yes .
na	I did for years.
^h	Well, I come from a family that was very large in Bell County
^h	and my grandfather came to Bell County on a covered wagon and had ten children,
sd	and so sometimes we would have a reunion with that group.
sd	And then, sometimes we would go to Arkansas where they came from and have a reunion with the entire group, you know.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	now we would have group like that in Arkansas.
sd	We'd have two hundred and fifty or three hundred.
sd	Well, so many of us came from a long way that we'd usually at a motel
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, you know, we were very close family,
sd	and, in fact, many of my first cousins are dead
sd	and of course they have their own families and grandchildren and all that,
sd	and we're a long way away,
sd	I doubt that that will come to be again,
sd	Well, and folks have gotten so mobile,
sd	but my brother and his wife live in Nevada, my daughter lives in Colorado, one of my nephews lives in New York City, one nephew lives in Memphis and my son lives here,
sd	but I think it's very unlikely we'll have a family reunion, you know.
b	Yeah,
sd	But my family's really all dead.
sd	But it was great pleasure while we did it, you know.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Does it bother you if your children are not interested in it?
qy^r	Does it bother you if your children are not interested in it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Well, what kinds of things do you do to try to get your children interested?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I think probably that's, a good idea. Because I lived in Iowa for about ten years before I came here.
sd	And I was born in Ohio,
sd	and there are a lot of Mexican people here because we're so close to the border.
sd	and they are wonderful people
h	And, you know, I don't know,
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
aa	I would think so too.
b	Uh huh,
^2	Asylum, of some sort.
b	Uh huh.
o@	Well, Well, I teach in the suburb of Dallas
sd	and, my kids go to school in another suburb of Dallas. with very, very good school systems.
sv	And it seems like a lot of the Orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools.
sd	And they're head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here.
sd	And, you know, they're just extremely bright kids.
sv	Well, I think things come easy for them too.
sd	and they have,
aa	Yeah.
sv	But what I see is y ,
sv	And it's causing, you know, I think some problems.
aa@	It really is. Because we see a lot of racial problems in the Dallas area anyway, especially in Dallas.
sv	And it's mainly Black and, and Hispanic.
sd	But, there has been some resentment with Orientals in the Black community because they've started businesses there,
aa	It is.
sv	I've, I've always prided myself on not being prejudiced and you know, welcoming everyone that wants to come here.
sd	And even when I was younger when I was in college, I was a member of the N A A C P because I lived up north,
sd	But I've, I've become very cynical in the last three, four years living in Texas.
aa	Uh huh,
sv	You know, you just don't know.
sd	there's somebody on my other line
sv	you kind of, you don , you really don't know what to do.
sd	And both of my children are really more tolerant of Blacks and Hispanics than they are of the Orientals, for some reason.
sd	And I really don't want that to happen.
sd	But, but it's happening.
sd	And I think a lot of their friends feel the same way too.
sd	and I really do wish I knew about quotas and really wish I
b	Yeah.
sv	Probably if I did, I might be a little bit more, tolerant, perhaps.
sd	and even if I really wish I knew the situations they were going back to or coming from.
sv	You don't know any of that
sv	and for some reason Orientals are very,
sd	And in stores and so and so forth it's, wh ,
b^r	pardon me?
aa	Yeah.
sd	You know, just going for it, they take it quickly.
sv	And, they don't think anything of that.
sd	and I know that.
sd	But it sometimes it's gets touchy.
sd	and I'm sure it's a lot different,
qw	What part of Maryland are you from?
bk	okay.
sv	And I'm sure that it's a lot different there.
qh	Is that right?
b	Uh huh.
sd	and it's a kind of a touchy situation.
sv	And I wish that we could all just learn from each other and not feel threatened.
b	So anyway,
fc^m	It was good to talk to you too.
fc	All right.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	Well, I have a, a former exercise program.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh,
aa	Exactly, yeah,
b	Uh huh,
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
aa	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
ny	Uh huh,
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh,
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh,
sd	and so. I found that really helps.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	I don't know if I'm that brave yet .
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
fc	Well, good luck to you there in Idaho.
fc	Well, I'm in graduate school now.
fc	Yeah.
fc	Pardon?
b	really,
sd^t	and I haven't started yet because I wanted to get one first see how it worked.
b	Really.
sd	I was trying to think of the one I went to a couple of weeks ago,
b	Oh.
^2	That's your weekend.
b	Really.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
b	Right .
ny	Yes
sd	and I really enjoyed that.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	so, yeah.
aa	Right,
aa	Probably they have.
sd	and we had a sleep over one night.
sd	and I was hesitant,
sd	all twelve,
aa	Yes,
b	Right,
aa	No.
sd	I love PRETTY WOMAN,
ny	Yeah.
sd	I don't remember the name of it
sd	That was really excellent.
b	Yeah,
br	What was?
h	I don't know.
b	Really.
b	Oh.
sd	That scared me to death,
aa	yes.
sd	It was horrible.
b	Really.
aa	I like that, too.
sd	I like funny movies
b	Yeah.
b	Is he really.
b	Yeah,
sd	so that's close, you know,
b	Yeah,
h	I guess.
b	Oh.
b	Really,
b	Really.
qw	When did you live there?
b	yeah.
sd	I was in New York in the sixties.
qy	Are you from Texas?
bk	yeah,
b	yeah.
aa	it is,
sd	I'm used to it now.
ny	yes
sd	and you can imagine what Plano was like eighteen years ago.
sd	It was very difficult.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah
ny	yes,
qo	How about yourself?
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that sounds good.
nn	No,
qy	Have you seen that by Bly?
bk	Okay.
sd	And how they deal with life itself .
sd@	But it's all revolved around, mythology. as far as, traditions from, other cultures and our culture. And how we, interact with one another.
ny	Yes.
ny	Yes.
sd	By Bly,
ny	Uh huh.
sd	And, it's a very interesting book.
^h	Well, it depends again if we're talking about ,
sd	And I read a lot of books in the area of, psychology and self help type, materials.
sd	always trying to understand people better and understand myself in relation to other people and try to understand where the people are coming from because I'm in a people business.
sd	my work is my hobby .
sd	So I enjoy it.
sd	Well, I don't know if I have a favorite religious author.
sd	I would have to say that, some of the ones that consistently put out good materials, you know,
^h	I had to stop here and think a second.
sd^m	Max Lucado.
sv	Max consistently writes good books.
b	Yes.
sv	I'd say another, which is a local writer here in Plano, is,
ad	Well let's start with you .
b^m	FIVE HEARTBEATS?
qw	who was in that.
qw	When was it out?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
sd	that won best picture, I think.
sd	And Costner got best director.
qh	Another Kennedy movie, .
^h	One comes to mind here
sd	I can't remem ,
b	Yeah
bc	DEFENDING YOUR LIFE.
bc^r	DEFENDING YOUR LIFE,
sd	it's pretty entertaining,
^2	HOME ALONE.
qy	well, did you ever see HOME ALONE?
sd	that was a good one, too.
ny	Yeah,
sd	I can't believe I'm just drawing a blank, because, I've s ,
b	Uh huh.
sd	That kind of reminds me
sd	that was a good one too,
b	Yeah
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I haven't seen a whole lot either,
ba	I know
sd	but then you end up spending another six dollars on food.
^2	And a pop, you know,
b	Yeah
h	And, I don't know.
sd	I was going to say, you know, you can find certain restaurants that are nice, and have good food eat for thirty dollars.
b	Yeah,
sv	So that's what you're, dealing with.
aa	That's true,
sd	I ought to open the paper here because I know I've seen a few that have played.
sd	haven't, haven't been to one for a little while,
sd	That was pretty good.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I'm trying to,
qy	did you see that?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	But it's been out for a while.
qy	Have you heard anything on, like, OUT FOR JUSTICE.
qy	has he had very many other movies out?
bf	Because it's a macho movie.
sd	Speaking of that I think TERMINATOR TWO is supposed to be out.
h	I don't know,
sd	they're action filled, and a little bit of humor,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
ng	I haven't heard much lately.
sd	I just remember when it first came out that it had kind of mixed reviews.
b	Yeah.
sv	You expect more out of, Julia Roberts, though.
qy	Did you ever see the original F X movie.
bk	okay,
sd	I mean I got in to it,
b	Yeah,
b	yeah,
sd	you get these twists
br	What's that?
b	Yeah,
aa	That's probably true.
sd	it's, it's hard to say.
sd	But, I don't try to
qh	so why go out and see something right away, you know,
sd	But, you know, I haven't been to an opening for, you know ages, Just because.
h	I don't know what to think.
sv	But then there's that side of me that says, yeah,
sd	so it's like there is a struggle within me going do I be open minded and give them the benefit of the doubt which is kind of my basic personality.
cc	I'll do that.
b	Yeah,
sd(^q)	You know, they've always said, you know, the Soviet people were united,
o@	But, it's still, you know,
sv	And they probably do the same things.
qh	You think the C I A doesn't spy?
sv	Now the difference is I, I don't think we take people and kill them just because they don't believe what we believe.
bd	That's all right.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's true.
sv	You know, I mean, you know, any country that wants to be democratic I'm all for helping them, you know, because I understand that, you know, you are looking at the United States as the biggest and longest supporter of that type of government.
sv	But at the same time I agree.
b	Yeah,
sd	but I am encouraged by what is happening in the Soviet Union.
sv	and I think it's moved in the right direction.
sv	You know, it's not going to.
sv	It didn't happen here overnight,
sv	And think sometimes we forget that.
sd^t	I know a little bit about it.
b	Uh huh.
sd	their biggest point of interest has been Nolan Ryan not the rest of the team lately,
b	Right .
ba	it's amazing.
b	Right.
sd	Well, fortunately the Red Sox, last time I saw the paper earlier this week, were in first place and doing quite well.
sd	I've been really busy at work this past week
sd	But hopefully next week I'll get back to my normal routine.
ng	Well, not really.
sd	I'm an officer in the Air Force,
o@	and, they have a speech lab across the hall from us.
sd	And, the speech laboratory does some work with, T I, not in my office
sd	but, in my division they do, quite a bit of speech work.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I prefer to,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, there's injuries in a lot of sport.
b	Uh huh.
o@	 baseball,
sd	but, for some people it's just,
ar	not so much that
sd	And so I was always throwing my arm out and, having trouble.
sd	and I was a catcher
nn	No,
nn	No,
sd	and it seemed to be, like the straw that broke the camels back,
b	Uh huh.
ba	My God.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
qy	Are you on any leagues now?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	a long time.
sd	And she's got to be,
nn	Well, no,
qy	You don't get any newspapers?
sd	I'm kind of the opposite of you.
sd	we have two newspapers.
ny	Yeah.
sd	And, I'm, in a government position that I'm in the news a lot
sd	so, I kind of look through to see what, I'm quoted in.
sd	But, how bad the quotes are every day.
aa	Yeah.
sd	Or, sometimes there's, letter to the editor about me
sd	but the T V, I don't really watch, even if I'm on it.
b	Right.
sd	C N N had the, {F uh,
sd@	At that point, I was watching the T V. On something like that.
sd	Well, the thing is, with T V, I,
sv	And, that's a problem that I have is not, getting just a little brief, idea of what's happening.
b	Right.
sd	always, I always turn that on
sd	that's one part I watch because I go surfing down here
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	so I can predict my week and where I'm going to be.
sd	So I can be at the beach when the waves start coming in.
^h	my goodness.
sd^t	that is a really good question because that was everything from the Rolling Stones to the Beatles.
b	Yeah.
bd	Well, I was, I was in seventh grade when the Beatles came out.
sd	I was fourteen years old.
^2	Woodstock?
^h	Well, I wanted to go.
ny	yeah.
sd	we could not get it together to drive.
sd	And here we were all hep to go to Woodstock, you know.
na	I really do.
sv	It would have been incredible.
sd	well, I mean, I remember we had the first Earth Day back then, you know,
sd	we got out of school at, the university,
ny	Yeah.
o@	Well, Well, you do.
sv	I mean there was no name to it.
^2	And busing themsel ,
sd	It was like just a continuum.
sv	And women's rights, I mean, things for women were totally different for you by that time.
sv	You just assume.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
^2	It seems unfair.
sv	see men are coming into their own now too.
b	Yeah.
b^m	Two kids.
o@	Well, see, bless his heart, you know .
sv	They are going to be back in style any day now.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
sd	you know, the situation you have right now
bk	okay.
sd	That's, That's, see, that is your commitment.
sv	You do not know what you are changing when you do something like that.
b	Uh huh.
bf	That one person that you could always count on being there.
aa	They definitely do.
na	well, see, if I had some I would.
sd	But my, friends are having babies right and left,
sd	and one gal, she started a business, in her home.
sd	I mean, you know, it is a family sort of unit sort of thing
sd	So that is a different way.
sv	And it is good for the kid
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
qy	Do you have any,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
aa	Right.
sv	Well, see and that is, the sort of the thing of the nineties is women working out of their own home.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
^2	Being there all the time.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	This generation,
sv	And, nothing is the same.
ny	Yeah.
sd^r	I said, "We passed them on to you."
sv	I mean, you know, because it takes a lot of hard work.
qh	and, you know, did we make the right choices?
sv	I mean, you know, I think we made a wrong choice when I look at the children of today.
sv	And I think business got in the way.
fp^m	Hi.
sd	When I think of camping I think of bugs , and sleeping bags and tents, like along the Appalachian Trail.
aa	No.
ng	I have never been camping .
nn	No.
b	Really,
bk	okay.
ba	I bet.
b	Uh huh.
nn	No,
sd	So they're really looking forward to that
sd	And see I was never exposed to it
sd	I feel like I'm a little bit too, much of a city mouse to try doing it .
qw	What's the best part about it to you, the quiet, the getting away?
ba	Wow.
qy	Now, like do you usually go and there's lots of other people around,
b	Yeah.
b	Yes.
fe	good grief.
sv	So it's not for the faint of heart, I don't think.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I think it would be,
o@	Well. I don't know,
ad	we talk about sometimes going up to Chincoteague
sd(^q)	maybe, like you said, start out slow and kind of get used to it, and find out that maybe it's not as bad as I fear it might be .
b	Yeah.
sd	it's been probably a month or so since I've been to the movies.
sd	SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was good.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	I guess it's a mystery, you'd call it.
sd	And it's pretty good.
b	Right.
b	Yes.
b	Right.
sd^m	that was an excellent movie.
qw	What'd you think of it?
sd	I don't think I can see it enough times.
sd	Course I'm a Kevin Costner fan.
aa	No,
sd	It got such bad reviews,
aa	I thought so.
qy	Have you seen THE FISHER KING?
sv	I guess it really isn't for everybody.
sv	But I thought it had a wonderful message to it. It's the kind you came out and looked at somebody and said, You know, I think I liked that .
sd	And then the more you got to thinking about it, the more you thought, You know, I did like it .
sv	But when you first came out, you weren't real sure.
sd	Haven't seen that.
ny	yes,
bf	the nanny type.
b^m	Housekeeper, uh huh.
sd	I saw one the other day that was A KISS BEFORE DYING.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	And it's a mystery.
aa	That's right.
sd^t	Well, I haven't tried,
ny	Yes.
sd	In North Garland,
qw	What school system are you familiar with?
bk	okay,
qy	are you familiar with the International Baccalaureate program.
qy^g	do your kids go to Garland High, you said?
bk	okay.
sd	she went from Austin Academy when it opened up, over to North Garland for ninth grade.
sv	But at North Garland, the difficulty I see with the education system is that, you can, you can get some masses,
sv	Well you know the, the thing that I don't see, and maybe you would take issue with it is that if we went to, if there was an opportunity for teachers to teach year around.
qw	Well how do we get that?
b	Yeah.
qy	Does it work well out there?
qh	Well, what about the issue of air conditioning.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
qy	Is that,
sd(^q)	you said you had some people from California.
bk	okay.
qy^d	But you didn't go.
sd	Well, the other issue that I hear that the local commentator I listen to some the idea that the numbers of administration and the fact that the principal,
sd	Well I had heard that one of the comments when they brought it,
sd	the one they brought in, the new superintendent for Dallas schools, the admini ,
sv	But they resented the fact that he would try to save some costs there.
sv	Well, you know, the other thing that bothers me is the amount of money that it took to contest the football, issue.
b	Yeah
sd	I can't think of the name of the school, that,
sd	but in any event they, they kept arguing.
aa	Yeah.
sd	And they went to court,
sd	But just think of all the, all the lawyers you've kept employed,
aa	That's right,
sd	and all these other people are out running around.
sv	you mean, we need a little more of our tax money, like maybe,
b	Yeah.
ba	that's interesting,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	And he's not an overachiever.
sv	But that a lot of the schools I would think the kids you're talking to, question of how much reading do those kids' parents do.
sv	Well, but that's the point, as I would say,
sv	and that's what makes,
sd	Well see, that's in the Garland schools,
sv	Well, opportunity,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ny	Well, yeah,
sv	But, if more people like you though that understand the problems get in and change some education
ny	Yeah,
sd	I believe it,
sd	I know there's a lot of problems with it,
sd	But, I know there's a lot of problems with that, like, well, they say, okay, if you put them on death row and execute them, well, then ten years later you find out that he really didn't do it, then that life was wasted,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
b	Right.
aa	that's a thought that I had never really had on that which seems pretty sensible.
aa	Right.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sv	I mean, I don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with
sv	so to me I'm paying taxes, you know, twenty percent of my check or whatever to keep somebody alive who I, in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society,
sv	so I'm all in favor of it.
h	Well, I really don't know on that question.
sd	and in that case, Wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty,
sv	and I think that he should not be allowed to live,
sd	But cases where I think the death penalty should be withheld, not really that I can think of.
ar	I don't really agree with the, death penalty for people like Noriega and such as that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	it's a nursing home for elderly people.
sd	And this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape.
sd@	A lot of them have had, limbs amputated, or, have serious illnesses. You know, that kind of thing.
sd	the interesting thing was I watched this particular one change hands.
sd	and then a new company bought it, and came in and remodeled the whole place.
sd	Hired new nurses and, just redid it, you know.
sv	Well, to me, it was dirty, for one thing.
sv	when you would walk in, the smell was just, awful.
sd	you know, the floors, if you're walking on them, feel how filthy they were.
sd	there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and, you know, crying,
sd	Of course, I don't know how many of them were, you know, not in their right mind. or how many were,
b	Yeah.
b	And, yeah,
sd	You know, neglect to cleanup.
sv	I don't really think anyone was being, you know, cruel or, or trying to mistreat them or anything.
sv	I just think they were not doing anymore, you know, than they had to do.
sd	But this new company came in
sd	And it smells nice when you walk in.
sd	They made a little patio area where they can go outside.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	this place that we visit, it's really neat.
sd	And they will do bingo.
sd	And then other groups come in and do the services, you know, other Sundays,
sd	So that they have at least one service every Sunday.
sd	So there are a lot of things.
b	Yeah.
sd	And, I have other friends.
sd	Like they also have a dog that maybe needs a home
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	I thought that was a real unusual thing, for someone to do.
sd	there's a lot that can be done.
sv	It's just a matter of people not being lazy.
sv	And, you know, doing the best they can.
b	Right.
b	Right,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	And so a lot them have told me exactly the same story, you know,
sd@	every time I visit them. They'll reminisce about childhood, and tell me something that they did
sd	and then the next time I go it's the same thing, you know, just somebody to listen to them.
sv	just seems to make them really feel good.
b	Right.
sd	but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate.
sd	And, he's blind
sd	I mean, he's just like in a world of his own,
sd	And if you come over to him, if he can touch your hand, he'll grab it and kiss it.
sd	and he's always got a smile.
sd	But he can't say anything.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Me, too.
b	Yeah.
ba	I know.
ba	I know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I have a three year old and a six year old,
sd	and they, have gotten comfortable being around these people, because they've always gone with us,
sd	and the people love them.
sd	And they want the children, you know, to hug them or hold their hand
sv	and I think it's because they've gone since they were real little,
sd	and they've never been afraid.
sv	people need to take groups of children, Because the kids just brighten up their lives.
sd(^q)	As we walk through the lobby they'll all say, bring her here.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Well, me, too.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	But, like you said, I'd really have a lot of second thoughts before I put any of my own family members there.
sd	It would be a last resort.
ba	I know.
qy	Am I going to end up in a place like that ?
b	Yeah,
fc	Yeah.
fc^m	Bye.
b	Oh .
sd	right now my car is terminally ill
sd	so I am really facing the purchase of a car.
sd	well, I would like for one time in my life to have a convertible.
sd	And, you know, I don't even like the wind blowing in on me
bh	Is that right?
sd	well, I didn't realize it.
ba	I know,
b	Huh.
aa	Well, yeah,
sd	you know it's, it's a major purchase, now.
sv	If they held their value, that would be one thing.
sv	But when you consider that when you drive them off of the show lot, they're immediately two thousand dollars depreciated.
qy	And, you know, that,
sd	Well, I'm seriously considering going that route instead of a brand new car.
sv@	Well, you know, some people have to have a new car every year. Or you know, at the most every two years
sv	and they don't drive them that much.
sd	And if I can find one or a repossession.
sv	And with the banks being in such financial, you know, problems now that people,
b	Uh huh.
qy	Are you both from Utah originally?
bk	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	how nice.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure,
ba	wow.
ba	wow,
ba	Wow.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
o@	that's, wonderful,
qw	Now how many people are in his immediate family?
ba	wow.
ba	Wow,
ba	Wow,
qy	Are they all here in the area,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, we don't really get together,
sd	And, my cousins you know, they put on a family reunion, once a year,
sd	and that's back in the
sd	and that's in New York,
sd	And it's not really a weekend,
sd	and so, they're all kind of local and close,
sd	that would be so wonderful .
b	Uh huh.
ba	wow.
b	Yeah,
^2	Take everybody,
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah,
ba	that sounds so wonderful,
b	Uh huh.
sd	But then one brother and sister from each family.
ba	wow,
b	Uh huh.
ba	I see, uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd	I'm a single parent,
sd	and then, of course, take care of the house and all this good kind of stuff.
b	Yeah.
sd	the thing that we like to do the most is to watch T V together.
sd	And, the kids like to play Nintendo,
na	That's right,
aa	Me either.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yes.
aa	I know,
sd	that's a neat thing.
sd	So we like to do those kind of things.
b	Uh huh.
ba	how neat.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm constantly going back and forth.
b	Yeah.
o@	so, it's really neat.
b	Uh huh.
^2	Boys .
b	yeah.
sd	that was a cat that hit the telephone.
aa	Yeah,
sd	and the babies,
b	Right.
b	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
qy	Well, do the, do your daughters live close where you can go out?
ba	good.
b	yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b@	 yeah
aa	yes,
aa	Yes,
b	Uh huh,
sd	There we go.
aa	That's right,
ny	Yes,
sd	And I work full time,
aa	That's right,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
b	Yeah,
b	That's right.
aa	that's true.
aa	That's true,
sv	I think on the local elections it's actually,
b	Right.
b	Right,
b	Yeah,
qw	What do they have to do with one another?
bf	so they didn't want to wind up being a juror ever.
sd	I didn't realize that actually.
aa	Yeah,
sd(^q)	Just go in and say, I want to be a juror,
sv	Well, that just seems to be a person who just you know, doesn't, doesn't, sort of, likes rights probably, but doesn't like responsibilities.
sd(^q)	I mean, that's what it boils down to, is people say, I don't want to be on jury, you know,
b	Yes.
b	Yes,
aa	That's right.
aa	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
aa	That's probably true.
ba	That's good,
sd	I don't know her politics.
ba	That's very good.
ba	that's, that's, that's very good.
sd	Say, I, I would think that, that people like that,
b	Uh huh.
nn	No,
b	Uh huh.
b@	Yes. That's what,
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
aa	That's true,
sv	and you don't want a judge to be appointed because you don't want someone's friend to be a judge.
sd	But on the other hand,
aa	Right.
aa	That's right.
qw	So, how do you think we can get people to vote?
sd	So given a choice between, you know,
b	Uh huh.
sd	that, that, that would be interesting,
^h	Well, let me preface it.
sd	and I'm in active reserve now,
sd*	I was an interesting, in that I think that he gave the American people a sense of the fact that, wars are really run by politicians. / * I > It??
qy	are you old enough to remember the war?
ny	Yeah.
sd	Well, December seventy two, was when we bombed North Vietnam, and then they released the prisoners in early seventy three, in that time frame.
qy	I think, the significant thing is today did you, did you see Barbara Walters interview with Schwartzkopf?
qw	Well, what's your perspective on it?
ny	Yes.
sd	Well, well, the difficulty I have, is that, are we our neighbor's keepers.
sv*	And, this is what I find particularly difficult in that, if we see injustice, and weather it's in you know, Chicago, * typo weather > whether or, or Dallas, I think if we see it, you know, we see John Wiley Price hollering injustice, I think that's wrong.
qy^t	Now the question is was there injustice in Vietnam,
qh	the difficult, point is to, where do we step in,
sv(^q)*	and the, the other part is, the, when your, when your, when your looking at Vietnam, and you say, well, is fifty eight thousand lives worth it. / * 3 typos your > you're
o@	Well, the, other issue is, is how, how do you allow injustice. Just like the policeman in Los Angeles how could,
qh	could you stand there and watch them beat that guy.
na	Well. In some cases we would,
b	Yeah.
qh	and the idea, do we go out and feed these people when they're hungry.
ny	Yes.
qh	and the question is, who was he going to pay it to?
sv	the communists are all alleged democrats.
sd	democratic formed government,
sd	I mean, you couldn't imagine that one would, would conceal a bomb and and do these kind of things.
sv	I think socially, it really destroyed a lot of the people that went over and saw these people.
sv	and I think there was a lot of tearing of emotions,
sd	now, it was in general, bad,
sv	and I think we need a little more justice at home.
sv	Well, the difficulty is is if you look in the old test meat, and in the numbers of places that, the Lord went out and just simply struck down, / * old test meat = Old Testament
o@	And, and that,
qy	you know, and you,
qh	Why did you do it that way .
b	Yeah.
qy	and even at the local level, when somebody's assaulted what do you do, turn the other cheek?
ny	Yeah.
sv	I think one of the thing that I notice a lot,
qo	What about you?
b	Uh huh.
sd	And hers isn't a social thing as much as it's a stage they go through,
o@	So. I think you're right.
qr	in your opinion, good or bad, or both?
aa	I do too.
sv	I think it was too extreme.
ny^c	Yes,
aa	Different set .
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd	Well I have a bunch of computer journals because I'm in computer science
sd	but beyond that, lately I've been reading,
sd@	And lately I've been picking up some of the travel, both trade magazines and just the general travel magazines. trying to keep up on what's going on.
sd	my wife also gets a lot of the food magazines. BON APPETITE, and FOOD AND WINE and GOURMET.
b	Yeah.
sd	but she seems to.
qy	Do you read a newspaper?
b	Yeah.
o@	Some of them I used to get for the advertising. Like BYTE magazine which is, one of the larger computer ones.
sd	I haven't bought it now for about eight years.
o@	Because that was interesting. I think a lot of the trade magazines are like that.
sv	that half the fun is finding out what all the products are.
sd	But, you know, some of the get ridiculous.
sd	so TRAVEL AND LEISURE, FOOD AND WINE and I think they have some others, certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for
b	Uh huh.
^2	But not worth it.
sd	I've always had this,
sd	So I've always had this problem with CONSUMER REPORTS that in the areas that I know a lot about, I disagree with them.
sd	And I always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything, or what's going on .
sd	So like I've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent, organization magazines
na	some of them.
sd	But I usually just read through the sections on domestic stuff.
nn	No.
b	Yeah.
aa	Okay,
h	I don't know,
ny	yeah,
sd	it's kind of like made out of skirt steak
sd	You can buy marinating mixes here
sd	you can, you know, marinate it in any kind of barbecue sauce you like
sd	And, then you put it on a flour, like, you know,
sd	Then you put it on flour tortillas with, you know, guacamole and, sour cream and, you know, all kinds of, you know,
sd	It's really good.
qw	So, what kind of cooking do you do up there?
o@	 that sounds interesting.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	You cook them so often you kind of forget their names.
b	Yeah,
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
ny	yeah,
sd	or, but most the stuff that we barbecue is like steak and chicken and hamburgers, hot dogs, you know,
sd	the simple things like that,
sd	You know, barbecue beans and baked beans
nn	No,
sd	depending on the barbe ,
sd	it's totally different.
b	Yeah.
fc	Yeah,
fc	I come from Wyoming
fc	Yeah,
fc	Well, it's been interesting to talk to you.
fc	Thank you for calling.
fc^m	Bye bye.
aa	No,
sd	Well, to be honest with you, I'm not from Minneapolis.
sd	Orlando, Florida.
sd	So I'm not exactly a real Twins fan from birth or anything.
b	yeah.
b	Right.
b	okay.
b	Yeah,
qy	Is that right?
b	Uh huh.
sd	real good as far as I can tell.
ny	Well yeah
b	Okay.
b	okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh
sd	and I'm doing mine with Honeywell.
na	As far as I know,
sd	And in the major leagues, I guess there is a couple of different divisions
sd	but I was talking to my roommate a couple of nights ago, right after that game,
sd	But the thing is, there's like eighty six home games per year.
sd^r	Eighty six.
sd	You know, that's just the home games
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	That's a lot of baseball.
sd	Well, yo , if you consider it, the season starts,
ny	Yeah,
sd	Maybe it was November I'm thinking about.
sd	Well, I know for sure it was,
sd	and it was at least two months after I got up here.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I probably a little bit older than you are,
^h	And now I see
sv	so many different jobs, which I think is terrific.
sd	Because I'm a teacher
sd	And, not that I would give the career up because it's a safe career, plus, because I always have a job plus I am a single parent, too,
sd	and I need the income.
sv	and I think that's the reason why a lot of women have started to work, too, is because economically it's just a must.
sv	it's very difficult to get along on one income unless , the male, has an extraordinarily good job.
sv	And especially men who teach school, they don't make that much money,
sv	it's just an economic need now.
aa	definitely.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but still there's a lot more than there used to be.
sd	but I'm really grateful that I went to college.
sd	and she was able to make it.
qh	Isn't that something.
ny	Yes.
aa	yes.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Uh huh.
sv	if they want to dedicate most of their time to that they're, they can do it.
b	Uh uh.
aa	Exactly.
sv	I mean, not that I think that I'm equal to men because there's a lot of things that men can do that I, could never do strength wise and so forth
sd	but, also there's some things women can do like have children, that men can't do.
sd	I don't want to be equal
sd	And, And I'm not a women's libber.
sd	I really am not.
aa	I do, too.
aa	I do, too.
fc	Well, it was good to talk to you.
fc	All right.
fc	Bye bye.
qy	Central America, have you ever lived in Central America.
qy	do you think that we should have given up the Panama Canal?
sv	Well, there are those that, that think that, that the Panama Canal has some considerable strategic importance, particularly for the military.
sd	and they, in fact, they had,
sd	it's really,
sv	Well the interesting part about it is that, if, realistically it was economic.
sd	and, from a technical standpoint it wouldn't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in Nicaragua,
sv	but if there's no economic benefit,
b	Yeah,
sd	it is interesting, that, you know we look at the exploitation
sv	and we stole it fair and square,
o@	but, the idea of,
qh	what's America's role there
sv	Well, when you take a situation where I think in particular in Salvador where there is a significant under class , excuse me,
sv	and I don't know that I would advocate communism
sv	and when you get enough of them, you know communism would feed them all.
sv	if the guys got some incentive,
sv	whether he can export or at least, set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yes,
sv	Well not that we could be bought,
sd^t	Well of course, everything we're saying is being recorded
b	Of course,
^2	Particularly, if you're hungry.
sv	starving to death is not a whole lot of fun either
sv	In reality, I think, what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people and help them protect themselves,
na	some.
b	Yeah.
sv	But, we definitely need something there with all the hostages and what all.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	well, you know, I just see this Middle East situation with Russia and everything there that's happened I think that that crisis has kind of slowed down,
sv	So, I guess I view it as being the prime importance as far as trying to wind down some of the tensions and everything that are there.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I guess the question in my mind somewhat
sv	If you look at, Iraq for example and you know the recent thing with the U N going in there and the bomb development and all this kind of stuff, you know.
fe	Gosh.
sv	And I think there's a certain mentality to that's in the Middle East, you know, the constant fighting, you know
b	Yeah,
sv	so you know, I don't know so much if these peace talks are going to,
sv	You know, if we, even if we say that we're going to do stuff, I don't know how they'll stick to that .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	I tend to agree with you.
sv	You know, I think they have in mind what they want to do
sv	kind of the forceful, you know,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	Jeez.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes,
aa	Yes,
h	I'm not sure, what exactly is wrong with her.
sd	Prior to that I was told that she was dead,
sd	And, you know, it was a real hush hush thing
sd(^q)	and then, I was wondering why my mother always referred to, you know, his second wife as that hussy.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yes.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
o@	But, Uh huh.
sd	Well, I do cross stitch
b	really.
sd	Well, if I remember I think we made some, like Christmas stockings,
sd	Nothing as big as a blanket.
sd	And she makes a lot of afghans and all that kind of stuff
b	Yeah,
ba	well that's good.
qy	So are you on the T V then?
b	Oh.
bk	okay.
qy	So you don't have too much time for hobbies?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
sd	I'm a housewife.
sd	So, unless the kids are asleep I don't usually get much done either .
sd	But I've made a, few things, cross stitch things.
sd	And I made, like stockings for both my children and a Christmas tree shirt and that, type of thing,
sd	and it just takes a long time to get it done
bh	Really? .
sd	I guess you can make baby blankets that wouldn't take as long .
sd	Two.
b	Yeah
ar	Not quite .
aa	It's a fulltime job,
qy	So, have you sang at any weddings yet?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	that's a good place,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
ba	Well, that's good.
b	Yeah.
aa	that's true.
qy^g	Make your hobby into a business, that would be pretty good,
b	Yeah
qy	Did you have training in singing when you were, younger then
qy	Choirs and that kind of stuff?
ba	Well, that's nice.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
aa	Uh huh
ny	Yes.
h	I don't know,
b	okay.
fc^m	It was nice talking to you, too,
ny	Yes.
b	Okay.
^h	let's see.
qy	do you work for Texas Instruments?
bk	Okay.
sd	and those are only available at T I.
sd	So if I'm in a mall or something I can't get cash out without paying extra money
b	Uh huh.
aa	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
sd	Same at my house .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	it's mine too.
ny	Yes.
b	Yeah.
b	okay.
bk	I see.
b	Right.
nn	No .
b	Huh,
bk	Okay.
ba	yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yes,
b	That's right.
sd	Or if you travel for work and you get your reimbursement before the bill comes in, you get to keep the money.
b	Okay.
fc	Okay.
fc	Thanks.
fc	Bye bye.
o	Okay.
sd	we are punishing someone for taking someone's life,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay,
b	Okay.
sd	And I'm not saying that,
aa	exactly.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I also agree that, I mean, if there is somebody out there that's crazy and cruel enough to kill somebody or in some cases, kill several people at one time.
sd	there was a case in Dallas,
qy	You understand what I am saying?
sv	I'm, I mean, I'm not for killing anyone,
sv	but I don't want these people around, at the same time,
aa	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think we should be,
sv	but prepare them first.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	But they can't just walk out of prison and do that.
sv	There has to be some sort of buffer in there.
sv	Some sort of program or,
b	Uh huh.
qh	what can we do?
ba	goodness.
sd	You know, I'm trying to make it with my job, and make, you know, myself okay and make my family okay.
sv	And it's so hard to, you know, try and be one of the movers and shakers, I guess you would call them.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I work at channel six, here.
sd	And so, I guess, I'm pretty emotional about crime, things like that now.
sd	I get to see a lot of crimes,
sd	and I get to see, you know, people's, pain and things,
b	Yeah.
aa	Exactly.
bc	A service.
sd	Sometimes, you really want to say that,
b	Uh huh.
sv	Especially when you are dealing with a subject like, capital punishment or something or abortion, or something where there's an no or yes side,
sv	and you have your side,
sv	and you have to report both sides.
sv	But you really don't want to because you have your side.
b	Yeah,
sv	So sometimes that's hard
ba	That's good.
fc	Okay.
fc	Okay.
qo	Well, what do you think?
ad	Well, tell me about it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
qy	Do you find that those parents,
sd	typically the mother was at home with, the children and, and at least could kind of keep up on what's going on,
sv	and really society sort of dictates that, you know, both the parents work.
sv	And, I know I've heard some people talk about just the fact that even as far back as the, you know, the second and third grade, if the kids had, you know, proper reading skills or learned proper reading skills that would make a lot of difference.
b	Yeah.
sd	And, you know, there are some students who are even some who are maybe, you know, in the top ten of their class,
sv	It, makes it tough because you know when they come in with scores that low, they may be, good students,
qh	so, And then then it comes into, well, who's supposed to give it to them, the colleges and universities or, are they supposed to get that back in the high schools and, the junior highs.
b	Yeah
aa	Yeah,
qy	So how many children do you have at home?
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
ba	Well, that's good.
ny	well, yeah,
sd	sports car.
sd	usually either black or red.
sd	And electric windows, and power locks .
ng	Well, not so much that as it is,
sd	It is just a real pain,
sv	so, power locks, power windows are just things that, just really help a lot .
qo	What about you?
b	Oh.
b	Sure.
qy	Have you ever had a car with an air bag?
nn	No.
sd	Well, it sure seems to save lives
b	yeah.
sd	And I have never had a chance to,
qr	But, you think you'd buy, an American car or a European or Japanese?
qw	What was that?
b	Huh,
qr	Did it have, what, a three speed or a four speed?
ba	Wow.
sd	Well, actually, I much prefer a stick shift
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh,
b	Huh.
b	Huh.
sd	I guess I grew up on it and it's fun.
sd	and it, to me, it gives me more, a lot more control in snow and ice and slick conditions.
h	I don't know,
b	Yeah,
ng	Well, not necessarily in Dallas,
na	Well, I have done camping in the past.
na	Well, it is.
qy	Do you do most of yours in tents?
ba	wow.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Doesn't that always taste so much better, when you're out like that.
b	Uh huh.
b	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	what a clever idea
sd	I wouldn't have thought about that.
ba	that's a good idea.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I can't remember the name.
sd	And it won't take but you know, just a quick look at a map to find where those mountains are,
sd	but I took a drive up through there, as a matter of fact, last September, just took the drive through to see what was there.
sd	They have some wonderful camping areas there.
na	Beautiful, beautiful country.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and we had a two bedroom mobile home there,
sd	they're grown now.
ng	They go camping on their own.
sv	Once you start them, they enjoy it all their lives.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and we'd have a little contest finding the tiniest shell, and finding the biggest shell.
sd	And, we did a lot of naturalist work when we were out.
sd	and we ate the wild plants
sv	the mountains can accommodate you if you know what to find.
aa	Uh huh.
sd	And, we cooked in a pot.
sd	I used a tire chain and the bottom of a Dutch oven.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ad	Well, if our time is up we can quit.
b	Okay.
fc	You bet,
b	Uh huh,
na	I am, as a matter of fact.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd^t	So, you know, I know about this project,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
^h	let's see,
h	I don't know whether I have any real profound thoughts about that,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	I mean certainly we took far more from Mexico than Saddam Hussein ever dreamed of taking, in his wildest dreams from his neighbors.
b	Yeah,
sv	And they can stand on their heads if they want too,
sv	I just don't think of Mexicans as being North Americans, although, I guess, strictly speaking they are.
b	I see .
h	I don't know.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well I grew up in Los Angeles.
sd	And, in fact, I drove a cab when I was a graduate student
sd	And certainly, you know, knew that problem,
sd	And, it was pretty wild.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	Well I am actually,
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	and what is said.
sd	And they're able to average it over a number of different occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
nn	No,
sv^t	And, I think a great number of students who got word of it and participated in general and voiced who heard about the program.
sd	I rely primarily on, newspaper combined with television.
b	Okay.
ba	That's rather interesting.
aa	I'd have to say I haven't either.
sd	I listen to the radio, probably five or six hours a week,
sd	We don't use the radio as a wake up,
sd	and it comes on with C N N in the morning.
sd	we wake up to television news and, shower and dress, and whatever to that,
sd	and occasionally what we'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in the car,
sv	So, we rely pretty heavily, I think, on a combination of the two.
sd	we tend to alternate between NEWSWEEK and TIME and whatever happens to be the, the, news magazine of the year for us.
sd	and, I read sporadically of commentary and a couple of other, you know, trade magazines, such as that, where I might read the, the occasional social and even current event commentaries, and everything as diverse as A C M to, some of the other tabloids I get.
sv	I've always said that it's really not interesting unless it's three weeks old and found its way into a news weekly headline.
sd	other than that it was a at best.
sd	we're probably not thrilled with our only newspaper that we have in Raleigh.
sd	it depends.
sv	And, consequently everything is filtered through that, Republican Democratic sort of, glass, almost unnecessarily
ny	Yeah,
aa	Right.
sv	and that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of Raleigh than the paper would have anyway.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
qy	Is that right?
b	Okay.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
sd	we probably were listening to C N N fairly heavily before the war broadcasts began.
sd	and, and we could equate or relate relay well to some of the newspaper and television articles about the fact that people where having this problem in uncoupling from the events, and going on with their.
sd	instead of watching the missiles and being glued to the tube or whatever.
sd	and then we would turn the television off
sd	And, that was the sort of thing that I would say is the best
sd	unless there's some trend or something that says, Jesus this neighborhood has been hit forty seven times or whatever. that's sort of more of a pattern news.
sv	Well, I think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home.
ng	I don't think so.
sv	but I still think in lots of job markets they are not treated as equals.
aa	Yes
sv	And I think that's what we really ought to look at that, if they are going to do equal work they ought to get equal pay.
sv	And they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions
sv	and I don't think that we have gotten there yet.
ba	boy.
sv	I think it's generally that switch over.
sv	So they have one and three quarters jobs now. Whereas the husbands have one and a quarter.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yes.
sv	So I think it really has put some additional stresses on the family units.
na	Well, I think one of the things that always happens is I think is when the one end you know were moving out to the end where a lot of women will be at work
sv	and then I think we are starting to see now some tendency of women at mid thirties
sv	Also, much of it is driven by economics right now.
sv	People have gotten out and gotten use to incomes coming in.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, I think they ought to have the right.
sv	but I have problems with men doing that
aa	I agree.
sv	I think one of the other things that has concerned me a little bit,
sd	and there's, has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who didn't have much intelligence because if she did she would be out in the work force, fulfilling herself.
sv	And I hope we reach the point where whatever women chose to do, that's acceptable.
sv	If they chose to go into the work force that's okay.
sv	If they chose not to, that's acceptable.
^2	As equals.
qy	Would you then go hiking.
qy	Were you up in Wisconsin
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Right .
b	yeah.
sd	it wasn't even a full tent.
sd@	and my dad would take, four kids. My brother and myself and two cousins
sd	and, we just thought it was absolute heaven.
sd	there was certainly nothing like a bathroom, a shower or anything, near by .
sd	actually some friends of mine and I are planning to camp this summer, for four days.
sd	and I have a idea it's going to be a lot more equipment and a lot more stuff than before.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	my.
b	Uh huh.
qy	you do actually, grow a garden to produce food?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bk	that's what I was curious about,
b	Uh huh,
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And, for many years I grew sweet corn,
sd	So we had a nice thing going there,
sd	it is very, very nice.
aa	Yes,
sd	So he had his own backyard garden, too.
sd	I use my Golden Delicious,
b	Yes,
br	What was the second one?
sd	I didn't see that one.
qr	Did you see those because of, Julia Roberts, or for, the subject matter of the two?
b	Uh huh
sd@	Well, that one is, it's cute but kind of far out comedy. Yeah,
sd	I, am not one for the,
no	I'm not sure .
sd	but on the other hand, I'm not sure I would have gone otherwise,
br	What?
b	Yeah,
ny	yes.
na	it was interesting,
sd	well, I'm trying to think of the other one I saw recently, the one on, DEFENDING YOUR LIFE.
sd	Well, that was one where,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes.
na	I enjoyed that one.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, whenever she starts crying .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, with some of the movies, if you don't go to them within the first four weeks, the movie may have, left town, never to show up again until it comes back in video.
sv	So, unless a movie is popular and stays around, you probably will see it on video these days more likely than at the movie.
sv	well, I think just most people have V C R s now
qy	Did you go to DANCES WITH WOLVES?
sd	at least what I hear on that one, that it's coming out a second time in a longer version even though it was a long movie.
sd	It's sort of the uncut version.
sd	I'd actually have to get a newspaper out.
sd	it's kind of, WHERE'S BOB? or WHAT ABOUT BOB?
b	Yeah.
^g	Do you?
qy	You think the problem is not enough doctors?
ba	Gosh,
ny	yeah,
sv	Now they can't doing anything about that.
sv	People are very sue conscious.
b	Yeah.
nn	No.
b	Right.
aa	That's right.
aap	It depends.
aa	Well, that's true,
sd	Because they have all these monitors now
sv	and so } it's costing more all around in health insurance for tests, for surgery, for longer hospital stay.
sd	So, it's terrible.
^2	You'll get it.
aa	That's true.
sd	And we have that happen.
sd	and at the last minute, they come to us.
b	Yeah.
sd	He better not be mine .
b	Yeah,
sd	They stop their O B at least.
b	Right,
ba	That's incredible.
b	Yeah.
sd	They are human.
sd	Occasionally something will go wrong.
sv	Well, you can be human and Catholic.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
aa	That's right,
b	Yeah.
na	I had a cat,
sd	I'm going to get another one as soon as I get back in town.
b	Yeah.
sd	I work and go to school
sd	it's kind of fun.
b	Yeah.
nn	No
aa	well yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	And dogs take a lot more care than cats do.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	they want the fun part and not the work.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well if you're going to have a pet, and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to, you know deal with the consequences, take care of the offspring
sv	and I think, you know,
sv	and it was a real positive thing,
^q	they're, they're, getting old now,
b	Yeah.
b	Okay,
fc^m	Bye.
qw	So, what's it been doing up there?
bh	really?
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
ba	my goodness.
sd	We have had so much rain for May and June that we've got all the, weather people down here really confused.
ny	Yeah.
sd	we're still having April showers, for June.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sd	it's been great because we haven't had to use our sprinkler system,
b	Yeah.
sd	We got enough.
ny	Yeah.
h	I'm not real sure.
sd	and it's meeting what's coming out of the Gulf.
sv	And it's just causing chaos
sd	so it's been, wet.
sd	And we've moved our yard I think three or four times in the last two or three weeks.
sd	I mean just because it just keeps growing and growing and growing
sv^r	You just couldn't get out there.
b	Oh.
sd	Well, what always works for me is if I water my plants or we wash the car, it usually rains.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
qy	Hotter than usual?
ba	Wow.
sv@	I guess that means you're going to get a double long summer. Because you surely wouldn't get,
nn	No.
sv	That's a little early.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and it was hotter there than it was here.
sd	It was just like a heat wave.
sd@	And I was like, I want to go home . Because, we packed to cool off, you know, brought shorts and sweaters and everything
sd	and we just died.
sd	It was really hot,
ny	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	He said it was a pain.
nn	No.
sd	So it was weird because we had snow .
nn	No,
sd	but we're just about right.
sd	We're just having all this rain,
nn	But no,
sd	but it's not, it's a dry heat
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
nn	But no,
sd	I was born in Texas
b	Yeah,
sd	Well, for many, many years, my wife and I did have a budget.
sd	we have a budget,
sd	So it's, it's helpful.
b	Sure,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I think I do that automatically myself.
sd	I mean, I unconsciously, you know, stay with a certain amount because I have enough food already stored here that I don't have to make any large purchase at any one time.
sd	All I normally do now is pick up little things here and there. If the salt goes out or we need sugar or something like that.
b	Yeah,
sd	Well, we keep a little note pad on a wall.
sd	So it's worked very well that way.
sd	That way we keep up to date .
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, actually, it's more interesting, too, if you've got the time.
b	Yeah.
b	Sure.
sd	we are, going to be traveling to Europe with a choral.
sd	and we make a two weeks tour of, foreign countries
sd	and I think we just sort of unconsciously do it.
aa	I do the same thing.
b	Yeah.
ad	Well, let's face it,
sd	And, I keep those levels up above a certain minimum,
ny	Yeah,
sv	I think, given, well given that there are so many people who don't have health insurance. It's probably a real smart thing, at least to have some basic coverage for everyone.
sv	I mean, you hear these horror stories of people, homeless people going to the hospital and, and being thrown out because they have no insurance, and having to go to someplace else.
sv(^q)	You know, it would be nice if, no matter where you are, or who you are, what happened, you know, what happened to you, you just go to the hospital and they say, Okay, just take him,
aa	Yeah,
sd	In Canada, where everybody, everybody automatically has insurance in Canada.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's true.
aa	That's true,
qy	so didn't get any choices at all?
ba	that's a problem.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sd	I mean I picked a primary care physician and just didn't like him, you know.
sd	I had to switch because I just thought he was a quack.
aa	Yeah,
sv	so you wind up getting the people who really want to be doctors, being doctors,
sv(^q)	but then again, you know, you don't get those people who would be good, and are real smart and decided, Hey, I want to make a lot of money,
^q	so I will go into medicine.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv(^q)	I mean, even something that says you know look, free major medical for all, you know, everyone
b	Uh huh.
b	right.
b	Yeah,
sd	insurance companies have to charge a substantial amount for certain people, or certain types of doctors, given that, you know, someone decides to have a malpractice suit against them, well, you know, it could be millions, I mean, unfortunately.
sd	I mean I'm sure there are those cases where the doctor is wrong or malicious or something.
sv	But you know their, you know. Mistakes, you know.
sv	Everybody makes mistakes, unfortunately.
sv	It shouldn't be a billion dollar, you know, industry.
sv	and this is their compensation.
b	Yeah,
aa	That would be nice.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I mean I'm sort of in a government run medicine program.
sd	Well, well I'm a graduate student.
sd@	At University of Rochester. In Rochester, New York.
sv	I'll bet you are in Texas.
sd	I was going to bet that,
sd	And because the university offers me two plans.
sd@	and they offer the portion. Which is, which is, you know, sort of everything else you need. Sort of your, your basic care. Beyond major medical and stuff.
sd	and even though my wife's insurance covers me, for everything, I still have to pay them a hundred and some odd dollars a semester.
sd	And that's for the mandatory portion of the insurance.
b	Yeah,
sd	but you know, it's just one of these things where I just don't want to spend my time.
sd	their rational is they make everyone pay for it so that it keeps the cost of university health services down,
sd	Because everyone is now forced to pay for this.
nn	Well, no,
na	Right
sd	We can do that.
sd	but in effect, I'm paying twice for one service.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
b	Yeah.
^2	Everybody else.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think the tendency is that as people get older, and gain, I don't want to say more responsibility, but you know, things like homes and kids, and so forth. They tend to lose that liberalism they had when they were younger.
aa	That's probably very true.
nn	No,
qy^g	you guys I believe in Texas you don't have state tax, do you?
b	Right,
sd@	We have state tax on gasoline. you know, because our.
sd	So on top of the federal tax on gasoline, we have state tax on gasoline,
sv	that could be, making up for the difference.
na	I have children that are in the Plano Public School systems
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh,
sv	Well, I think the public school systems are doing a good job.
sv	you figure out why you're adding it and what you're going to do with it once you've got it together.
sv	I don't care how intelligent you are if you be cannot make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted.
sd	And, this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why I went into education.
b	yeah.
b	yeah.
sd	And it's like, I going to take this home and study it before I can help you.
sd	You know, so they're really moving them along
sv	so I think that it's appropriate to teach them, you know, why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this.
ny	Yes,
sd	Well, filling out the forms and also all of these, statewide and national wide testing, things so that they compare
sv	and . You know, as far as I'm concerned you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say.
sd	And it's just a matter of how you're going to interpret it.
sd	You know, the whole first nine weeks of school is used as a review
sv	And I think that's totally useless.
sv	You know, and everybody's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah
b	really.
qy	Did you plant those yourself?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ba	That's nice.
sv	I think I know what they,
b	Oh.
br^m	Down here, the grass?
sd	we've had problems with our yard.
sd	It was just horrible.
sd	But my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff, that seems to be helping
sd	But we've got a Great Dane in the back
sd	and she has eaten everything I have put out there.
ba	I know,
sd	and I barricaded it up, so she couldn't get into it.
sd	And I went and took a shower and looked back out there
sd	So I can't do anything back there. Because she destroys it.
sd	But I've tried out in the front
sd	I had some shrubs I put out front
b	Yeah,
ba	I know.
ba	I know.
ba	I know,
sd	and they're big
sd	but toward the end of the summer, you know, when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree, then the grass starts growing.
ny	Yeah,
sd	So we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and whatnot.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	But only one is really like in the flower bed part
sd	So there's not really much I can do about that.
b	Yeah.
aa	I do too,
sd	I don't have anything to look at
b	Uh huh
b	Yeah
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
sd	I hate to mow the yard, more than anything else.
b	Yeah,
sv	sure I'll be more then glad to pay him if he'd just go out there and do it . and do it to where I don't have to go back out and redo it.
sd	that's my only thing with him.
sd	That's why I'm having him help me now .
b	Okay.
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
sv	You know, when they answer the company, I think it'll make it a lot easier
sv@	and they'd run into less problems. Because,
sd	I don't know, I come from the teaching field too
sd	I'm more or less, if they told me I had to well then fine,
sd	if I had my druthers I'd probably say well no
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	And, anybody who, gee, is, you know, doesn't accept the rehab program then they're, more or less, getting laid off.
o@	I think that's really hard to because, you know, you never know. I don't know, it,
sv	you know, that's what's they're coming across as is some of the companies anyhow.
sv(^q)@	Where, like a lot of people are saying, well I only smoked a joint last night, I don't have any problems you know. Or something like that,
aa	Right.
b	Yeah,
sv	And a lot of times, those are the things I don't like to disclose to an employer because then they don't want to have anything to do with you .
sd	You know, it's very personal.
b	Uh huh.
sd^r	Orwell.
o@	And, you know, his book. big brother is watching.
sd@	You know, you're being controlled. That type of deal
o@	you know, I don't know. Seems awful strange .
sd	But I can understand why they need it with all the, you know, train accidents and everything else.
na	I think they will too because, you know, it's just going to follow.
sd	I don't know. we haven't had any of it in our school system.
b	Right.
sv	And if they can test the teachers, that gives them the full right to test the kids.
sv	And then they, you know, caught everybody.
b	Uh huh.
^h	goodness,
sd	lately, I've been, on the whole, very practical,
sd	So I've been doing very little reading, except I did finally dip into a couple of biographies. all of sort of literary figures of this century.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
aa	No.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
qw	what are your favorite children's books?
b	Uh huh.
nn	No.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's interesting,
sd	So, I've read a great deal of old things.
sd	so I don't read the new ones,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Yes,
qw^t	What's the topic?
b	Okay.
na	You bet.
cc	I'll let you lead out.
cc^r	I'll let you lead out.
sv	I think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes is that they seem to be economically driven also.
sv	So if you look at Russia and what's happened over there, I think the change in Communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing.
sv	I think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things, I mean, I think it's great to even have three or four different careers in your life.
sv	I think it must have been terribly boring to go through, your life doing just one thing for fifty years or forty years.
sv	Some of that opportunity for job change in the fact that aspects changing.
sv	And the uncertainty of whether you're going to have a job is not as good,
sv	I think it's great.
aa	yeah.
sv	I think one of the problems with education as it relates to this, though, is that I don't know that education is prepared to help people make those changes.
b	Yeah.
sv	There probably needs to be some training on how to, to adjust to these changes as they come about.
sv	So it seems to me that while those changes are taking place, maybe we're not well preparing people to make the changes with them.
b	Uh huh.
na	Well, I love to cook as a matter of fact I'm making dinner right now .
sd	I'm making, some,
sd	And I had frozen it
sd	with, with wheat kernel that,
nn	No,
sd	so this isn't for her,
sd^r	stuff so,
sd	and she's having,
ny	Yeah,
sd	So we'll make you know, some sort of pasta or something, you know, homemade pasta or lasagna or something.
ba	good idea.
qw	What,
qr	Electric or,
sv	Best, kind.
sv	That's the best kind to have.
b	Uh huh,
ba	That would be great.
sv	you know, so you know that it's a lot of fun actually.
sv	It actually is, if, if you have a food processor,
sd@	and with that it becomes really easy to make colorful pasta. By throwing in some spinach or some tomato or something and mixing it up
o@	it's, a snap from there.
o@	And then , I made,
sd	I making yucky .
sv	people think it's real hard,
sd	Otherwise it's real ,
sd	it's good stuff.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
ba	That's great.
b@	 .
b	Yeah,
o@	and, it works real well.
sv	That means you're a real cook.
sd@	If you've ever watched the ones on television like, Jeff Schmidt, the super gourmet. he just, takes stuff he says, yeah about an ounce of this or something .
sd	It's real good.
b	Yeah,
sd@	or, we have people other that have never experienced it before and haven't had much middle eastern food. / * other = over
sd	We make, cause we're my wife is Syrian.
sd	And, her families always have this food she grew up in,
sd	so we make, four or five middle eastern dishes that are just all real simple.
sd	We put them out for people
sd	, that's, that's, that's a fun idea I mean if you ever, want something different to try.
cc	I would try that.
qy	do you have a wok though?
b	Yeah.
sv@	I think it's God's gift to cooking. Cause it's just quick,
sd	it's easy,
sv	you know, and it doesn't taste like a million calories of oil
ny	Yeah,
sd	so wok food seems to be our thing.
qo	So anything else you cook .
ba	Well, that's good,
qy	the Wilson course?
sd	I like it .
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	he's, got a degree in business management
ad	Can you hold on one second?
ft	Thank you.
sd	Some one kept beeping in our calling waiting ,
b	Yeah,
sd@	when my wife and I got married the night before we had a party. Or two nights before
sd	and he made a real big cake himself,
sd@	, so New Years our friend made a baby. Cake like a baby New York.
ba	It was amazing
o@	so. I get the mold I put it on, you know, the frosting always melts
b	Yeah,
bf	that you mean about the, mix itself.
ba	Well, that helps.
b	Yeah.
sd	those kill me
sv	I think that's part of the problem,
fc	Yeah,
fc	it was a pleasure chatting with you.
fc	Yes,
fc	Bye bye.
o	yeah.
sd	it's very hot,
sd	so I can't do very much gardening other than balcony gardening you know,
sd	I have the little flower boxes with, a lot of different flowers,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
o@	Well, the, Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
nn	No,
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I would have no idea .
sd	No idea whatsoever.
ny	Yeah,
sd	well, except, I do have some, some day lilies that you know, I don't do anything with
sd	and they seem to come back year after year,
sd	but here we still do get some snow and ice and things like that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow, uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh
sd^t	I've been called a lot,
sd^t	and you know, I've called a couple of times,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
nn	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my, uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
cc^r	I'll have to make sure I catch that,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	right now, the District,
sd	in Fairfax, Virginia.
ny	Yeah,
sd	Right now I know the azaleas and everything are out are beautiful.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	yeah.
nn	no,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, I guess that I really don't know that much.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
sd	and she in fact is a data entry person,
nn	No.
bh	Really?
ba	That's wild.
ba	boy.
ba^r	So that is pretty close .
sd	But I'm home with the kids all day
na	Pretty much,
sd	and that was another reason why I really wanted to be here because, you know, they have had a couple foster homes already.
sd	The baby was eleven weeks old
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	boy.
b	Yeah.
ba	that's neat.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	That's the hardest thing I think, you know to deal with is that people love your, kids.
sd	I put, my oldest in a preschool program just for him to have the experience of two mornings a week of being with other kids and starting to learn some taking turns and, you know that kind of thing
sd	and, he was in there for three months when I pulled him out
br	Pardon?
na	I didn't think much.
b	Yeah.
sd	And she just kept saying how wild he was.
sv	I mean, it's kind of like there was so much going on that she felt like she needed to control more
sd	and it's really hard to con ,
aa	Yeah, you know.
sd	It was expensive.
sd	And I felt like that was a big factor for me.
sd	That they would would be safe you know, from any kind of abuse or that kind of thing.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	gosh.
bf	You had to come home and clean before you could even do anything probably.
ba	gosh.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I didn't either.
sd	And the other one was that the younger one got bit really badly by another child
sd@	and what they did was they took my younger one out and put him in a crib and left him in a crib the rest of the day. Instead of taking the kid that was biting out and do something with him.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
bf	So you feel like your values aren't getting,
b	Yeah,
sd	You know, basic things like that.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	Wow.
ba	what luck.
b	Really .
ba	that's great.
b	Yeah
bd	That's okay .
b	Yeah.
ba	that's great.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
bf	They think it's fun.
b	Yeah.
b	Really.
sd	I can't even go grocery shopping right now with the two of them because the baby is so into everything
sd	and the older brother is you know, running around all over the place
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	so I think I'm going to look for that.
sd	and that's not that big a deal, you know.
sd	For a couple times .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
ba	That's sounds good.
fc	Okay.
fc	Okay.
fc	Yeah.
fc	Bye bye .
sd	Well, of course, working.
sv	That's definitely got to be the biggest thing, is that everybody's out there working including me .
qw	Well, what do you think it is?
b	Yeah.
aa	Yes, they do.
b	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh,
aa	Yeah,
sd	It used to be that our list ran nineteen, twenty, twenty one for our patients' ages.
sd(^q)	and if we get somebody twenty one, we go, look how young.
aa	So, yeah,
sv	So, it's true.
sv	But again, I guess it probably does go back to the same thing of women having careers.
sv	If they didn't have,
sv	I guess it's a combination.
ar	No,
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, just that.
sv	we do it all .
sv	I really think that,
sv	I really do.
sv	and they're contributing to the income besides.
sv	I think that we're really putting a lot of stress on ourselves.
aa@	it is. Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	it's a very wealthy town,
sd	and I really hate that you know,
sd	I hate to see that,
h	but, I don't know,
sd	but I used to just work occasionally for extra money,
sd	and that's really hard
sd	and I don't know how a mother does just choose to go out to work, and leave the kids.
sv	But to just go out there forty hours a week, at least and and work and leave your kids to get home from school alone, and that kind of thing, I think that's not very smart.
sv	I think that's difficult on them.
^h	Well, it's going to be interesting.
b	Yeah,
sd	I don't know how they're going to do it.
sd	And so I don't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again.
sd	but I don't know what effect it's going to have on these kids now when they grow up, how they're going to feel about it.
sv	you know, it could lead to another Woodstock type thing, you know, where where there's just too much material things,
sv	and maybe these kids will really resent that their parents are out there working for things
sv	and they might want to do without things rather than do that to their families.
sv	It's hard to say.
b	Uh huh.
na	Well, a little bit,
sd	we've had a lot of fun,
sd	as far as the camping part of that, we just drag along all our tents and sleeping bags and, find a clearing in the woods and go for it.
aa	Well, yeah,
aa	Yeah
b	Okay.
b	Okay.
b	Right,
b	Okay.
ba	Boy, I bet,
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	But we're starting to get everybody back together.
nn	No,
ba	I'll bet,
aa	Uh huh,
ng	not really just yet.
sd	and I've got a piece of property in Minnesota that is completely undeveloped as of yet.
sd	So, we've got a private lake,
b	So, yeah,
b	Uh huh.
ba	gosh,
aa	That's right.
b	Sure.
sd	You know, it's like, okay, this is, this is what, a pheasant looks like, you know,
b	Well, yeah,
b	Uh huh
sd	Well, I, exercise regularly.
sd	but Washington is one of my favorite places to visit.
sd	But Washington's a great place to do that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	Because I think there're so many parts of the District where it's not very safe to get out and walk.
b	Uh huh.
no	Well, it's really both.
sd	And I often find that even when I don't feel that much like exercising,
sd	And that's really a terrific feeling, because you just go there at the end of the day, and you figure, God, I'm ready for bed and you exercise and then, it's sort of painful for a while,
sd	but by the time you get done you feeling really terrific.
b	Yeah,
qy	Philadelphia?
sd^t	I'm trying to because you have one funny vowel that's probably going to drive the T I people crazy.
sd	Say out, instead of out you say out.
b	Huh.
b	Huh.
ba	I see.
bk	okay,
aa	Yes.
fc	Well, same here.
fc	Bye.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Well, and when I have my spare time , I do enjoy,
aa	That's right.
sd	And I've been doing a a picture for my father in law,
sd	And some other things I like to do are, music and, also reading.
sd	Well I enjoy singing.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	yeah.
nn	No,
sd	And then of course, once I got to the age where I could have done it myself, I had other interests I guess.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	We will be busy with that again.
br	Pardon me?
na	Well, I did with my older daughter
sd	and she was in it for a few years,
sd	and she is in band.
aa	Yeah.
aa	Very much.
fc	No,
fc	Thank you for calling.
fc	You too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	wow,
sv	It gets boring.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, it reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging, I think.
sd	But I do a lot of it in the car.
ny	Yeah,
sd	so I have nearly an hour both ways that I can really get a lot of work done
sd	I don't know that I could even think about quilting.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I bet.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I bet.
sd	There's so many things I wish I had learned to do with my mother.
qh	And when I look at it now, she's been dead for a long time I think why didn't I learn these crafts and skills from her because she could crochet and do so many of the old things that aren't in vogue right now that people just don't know how to do.
nn	No.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I want to learn to crochet.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It's funny, when you were talking about sewing, I love to do anything by hand with a needle.
sd	But I'm totally intimidated if I sit down at a sewing machine.
sd	But I just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm at the age where bifocals or trifocals would be necessary.
b	Ooh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, sometimes, even with that. I think you have to have some,
sd	One that I can't find anymore which is GABRIEL'S FIRE.
ny	Yes.
sd	It was usually on, Thursday nights.
h	I don't know .
sd	It was same time period,
qy	You don't know what happened to GABRIEL'S FIRE then?
sd	I don't remember from one station to another.
qy	is he the reformed, gambler?
aa	Yes,
ng	I really don't watch that much T V,
aa	you're not kidding.
bc	Midnight.
bc^r	Midnight.
na	I tape it.
ny	Yeah,
sd^r	I tape it.
sd	And, I'm like, I don't believe this.
aa	I don't either.
qy	You're in New York?
b	Oh.
sd	I'm in Dallas, Texas.
bh	really?
b	Oh.
aa	I think it's great.
sv	it's a great role model for everybody.
aa	yes,
sd	They hold competitions in Los Angeles in, Florida and Minneapolis, Minnea ,
na	and that's it.
sd	There is a woman that, made,
bf	Strictly your skill.
b	Huh uh.
sd	I think the last I heard was it's up to about a hundred fifty thousand dollars.
ny	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
sd	well, they, they come out with a lot of bruises too.
b	Hey,
sd	see I tape MURDER SHE WROTE.
sd	I like mysteries.
sd^r	I like mysteries.
sd	and I don't have to concentrate too hard on them.
sd	most of the lawyer programs like, LAW AND ORDER, they're not on the times that I've watched because I haven't had T V GUIDE around here in ages.
b	Yeah.
qy	Your news is on at eleven?
sd	Ten,
bd	that's okay.
bd	No problem.
nn	No,
sd	and they have one at ten.
h	I'm trying to think.
sd	that's MAJOR DAD at eight I think it is.
b	Huh.
b	Yeah,
qy	But, do you ever watch CHEERS?
ny	yeah,
qw	So, what is your opinion on drug testing?
b	Well, yeah,
sv	if, if the company is liable for something that, that, a employee does while under the influence of a drug, you know, then by all means they should have the right to, to, to to minimize their liability.
sd	And there's also the case about just, health and welfare of the, employees.
sv	If a company has a healthy work force, their insurance rates are low.
sd	And not only low, there's all sorts of a financial benefits associated with you know, having people file fewer claims, being sick.
sd	the whole question that a, that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is going to be more healthy
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sv	that's where the real sticking point comes in.
sv	I don't think there's any problem with testing people.
qw	It's what do you do with the information?
b	Right.
b	Right.
sv	the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing.
sd	Well, let's see, well, we assume I was an adult twenty years ago, .
arp	Yeah,
sd^r	Not vote.
sd	we had all the great civil rights legislation of nineteen sixty eight,
sd	And, around here on the, east coast, we were heavy into affirmative action.
sd@	And, that was a great shock for a lot of people. And, uh, a great disappointment for some people like myself.
sd@	I was gainfully employed by Safeway Stores Incorporated. And, trying desperately to, get ahead with the company.
sd	the problem was that my hair was too long.
sd	and, you weren't allowed to have a, mustache or a beard,
o@	and, if you wanted to get ahead with the company,
sv	well if you were a, black female you were destined to be store manager in six to nine months,
sd	And that's basically where I ended up.
na	I think so,
sv	I think they're like all companies, well represented.
sv	And, you know, everything seems to be fine.
sd	I've kind of lost touch with the company,
sv	but, as far as their management goes, I'm not sure they're any better off than they were before management wise.
sv	But, other changes, just people seem to be more outspoken now individually, rather than collectively.
sd	back in the seventies we had, a lot of, protests against the war, and, bring our troops home
sv	And, I've noticed, that now, more and more individual people are speaking out for their own rights rather than massing together.
b	Yeah,
sv	And, everybody was into me,
sv	and, people's response to that, you know, at first not trusting and now, expecting more.
qw^d	And what about the last ten years that you've been aware.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
aa	Yes.
sv	But even, I think, along the line of the, goals of civil rights, there always seems to be some prejudice to someone by anyone.
sv(^q)	You know, don't like the way you look, don't like the way you dress, don't like your hair, don't like, you know it's just something that always sets people off.
sv	And the problem is that ideally you know, the world would like you to be completely indifferent.
sv@	and you keep that image your whole life . No matter what you do.
sd	I've seen a lot of changes, I mean, from the original earth day
sd	and, I'm heavily involved in, you know, my own personal recycling.
sd	and, you know, I do the newspaper and cardboard and paper and, you know, all that stuff at home
sd	and I'm starting to see more and more recycling centers, cropping up all over the place here, on the, east coast,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	And then they turned around and called them junkyards, and, started making profits off, them after the war.
sd	And now we got to the point where the junkyards, you've got to pay them to take something there,
sv	so, things have really changed a lot.
b	yeah,
qy	And this person's teaching my children?
sd	You know, I had a real problem with that.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	I'm not sure if your familiar with the movement they have here in Maryland,
aa	Yeah
b	Really.
sd	That would be interesting because actually, I'm, I'm I'm Jewish
sd	But I have a lot of friends, you know, who are sort of adamant, you know, Israel,
b	Right,
sv	I mean, the only way to think about it is Well, they won, you know,
sd	So, I don't know how to, I don't know what to do about it .
na	probably,
sd	I just heard something recently, about moving,
aa	That's true.
b	Yeah,
sv	But I think that's actually the scariest part, because what's happening in Iraq right now, you know, in itself, it being so crazy there.
nn	No,
ny	Yeah,
sd	she has sort of friends and family in Saudi Arabia, who are some friends in Saudi Arabia.
sv^e	I think it's, for her not really relevant, because she is second generation American, actually.
sd	Her parents who were born here would like to go see it, though, I think.
sd	You know, something about the place makes it not quite enjoyable.
ny	Yeah,
sd	I was there a couple of years ago, when it wasn't, you know, sort of dangerous to be out there, I guess.
sd	And, I d , do like it actually.
sd@	But I do like the food. so, if that, if that amounts for anything.
b	Yeah,
sd	Turns out, you don't, you don't really find bagels in Israel.
b^m	knishes,
sd	it's very different.
ba	it, it is very strange.
na	that starts tomorrow night.
^2	Bought up all the bread from .
sv	Got the vocabulary down and everything.
sv	that, that makes you real good.
sd	But I sort of, you know, do a lot of these things,
sd	two years ago we had a Seder,
sd	And I was the only Jew both nights.
sv	which to me is wonderful, because it means that people who never would get to see this, get to see it.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	Right.
sv	You know, I mean, and that seems really weird.
aa	Right,
sv	same thing.
sd	I'll never understand it.
sd	Didn't hurt me, at, at the moment.
sd	and it talks about how, you know, if we could just all get toge , you know,
b	Yeah
qy^g	Well, are you a fisher person, are you?
ba	Great.
qy	In California?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I don't blame you.
sd	and, now that we are down here, I think a lot of people do some, bass fishing and strip bass fishing
ny	Yep.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
ny	yeah.
sd	and I, really I haven't gone fishing for about two years now
sd	and it's driving me crazy
ny	Well, yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
^g	Do you?
bk	Okay.
b	Yeah.
nn	No.
sd	Well, that's how we do it too.
sd	and then the skin just basically scrapes right off
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
ny	Uh huh.
qy	In, In Nebraska?
ny	yeah.
sd	And a lot of them ended up being close to the river,
sd	and so we would do a lot of fishing there too
sd	the biggest, way it's going right now, lot, } most of the grocery stores have got, things set up where you can bring in your, plastic, and your cans, and newspapers.
sd	And then they've just got different barrels setting out
sd	they've got them set outside
ny	Yes.
sv	You know, they just want to, help recycle. Which is, what we do. You know,
sd	probably the only thing, sometimes we'll take or the cans in
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
bh	 really?
ba	wow.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	So, it's vol ,
sd	you say it is all voluntary.
qy	Is it all,
bk	Okay.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah.
ar	Well, they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers, and stuff like that.
sv	But, you know, I think a lot of people, like I said, are more concerned,
 +	with, you know, right now, you know, the aspects of saving the earth .
o@	 Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Okay.
sd	I mean it's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees
sd	I can't believe that you know. Because they've got it all posted all over the place how much, they're saving and how w ,
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b@	Yep . Yeah.
sv	I mean, you know, cost wise and and, you know, saving trees and stuff like that.
sd	I mean, it's just amazing, you know, the difference.
nn	N ,
sv	but that doesn't mean that they don't.
sd	but, I haven't really seen anything advertise publicly.
sd	And then, like I said, they do a lot of internal, advertising on that kind of stuff.
sd	But, I haven't seen anything.
sd	But see, I don't see a lot of T I advertisements on T V anyway.
sd^r	You know. So, So, I don't see a lot of advertisements for T I.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right .
b	Right.
sd(^q)	And, I know my kids, like if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say, look at that. Somebody is not saving the earth, you know.
sv	So, I mean, the kids, I mean, they really try to educate all ages, you know,
sv	I mean, it's like nobody was concerned about it.
sd	You know, and it's like,
sd(^q)	You know, it's like all of a sudden when there's noticeable things, saying, Hey, you know, we're ruining the earth,
sv	you know. And now everybody is doing something about, which is good.
qw	But how come we weren't doing this, say, twenty years ago , you know?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
o@	Well, Yeah.
b	Right .
aa	Yeah.
sv	I think, that it really surprises me because of the cost savings.
qh	I can't understand why nobody saw that before.
sd	{E I, mean, } it's, so cost, you know,
o@	Bro , . yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh. I see,
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah.
sd	I noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil.
sd	And, I mean, that kind of surprises me .
sd	but they can.
sd	I don't know how cost efficient that would be, I guess,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
b	Really.
h	I don't know,
qy	You know,
h	I don't know,
sd(^q)	because like we were asking some people that live in, North Dakota, Well, you know, are you recycling.
h	You know, so, I mean I don't know,
h	I mean, I don't know,
sd	Well, sort of mixed feelings about it, I guess,
b	Uh huh.
o@	 Yeah,
sv	But, a lot of the crime, I think, that goes on, I don't know to what the degree the guns are purchased through regular channels or they're illegal guns.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	and, you know, I think stuff like that is perfectly good.
h	I don't know,
sv	but on the other hand, you know, like I say, I kind of against government control in general.
b	Yeah,
b	Right,
h	I don't know,
b	Uh huh.
o@	 Yeah,
sd	well you know, we, I grew up with them.
sd	And, you know, it was a whole different thing
sv	I'm not certain that people are, are terribly concerned about other people.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^h	Well, it's funny,
sd	This weekend I cleaned out my closets
sd	Tried it on and decided I really did not like how it looked on me.
sd	So yesterday I went to, a spa.
sd	and we set up a program for me to work on,
sd	So I've been two nights in a row
sd	Last night I did about thirty minutes of riding a bike and like, three different types of, weight lifting for my legs and, and my hips
sd	and then I did a hour of aerobics.
sd	And that was really tough .
sd	And I was sore this morning when I got up,
sd	but it's only thirty minutes
sd	thirty minutes was definitely plenty.
nn	No,
qy	Have you started exercising at home
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I have a girlfriend that goes for the social aspect of it
sd	so my husband goes a lot

sd	Well, I like gardening a lot,
qy	but, do you keep trying anyway?
nn	No,
ny	Right.
b	Oh.
nn	No,
sd	But, I've had to get my money back from them and had better luck with some of the more expensive companies.
nn	No.
b	Uh huh.
sd	now our local stores don't offer any guarantee.
qr	they're bulbs for Spring or Fall?
b	Uh huh,
ba	Cute.
b	Right.
bk	I see

qy	is that typical, to only breed them once?
b	Uh huh,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh,
qy	So will, you, breed one of the litter, then next year?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh
ba	Gee.
b	Uh huh,
sd	And that she has kittens that look like her.
b	I see.
sv	You can't just tell them that anyway,
ba	dear.
qw	What is it.
b	Oh.
ba	interesting.
sd	Well, mostly, a little fresh water fish,
sd	But, down here I haven't fished much in Texas.
sd	they're really not,
sd	just, usually worms, night crawlers.
na	Sometimes .
ny	Yeah.
sd	just little fish eggs.
sd	And, there's this one kind of cheese that you can put on the end of a hook
b	Yeah
sd	and they really like that.
sd	Now I have never caught catfish.
b	Uh huh.
bh	is that right?
b@	 Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	how about that.
b	Oh.
ba	I think that is really interesting.
b	Uh huh.
sd	see, and I wish I could go fishing here because I don't really know much about the fishing here.
sd	You bait the hook,
sd	and then you wait
sd	and they troll it a little bit.
nn	No.
b	Yeah.
b	uh huh.
b	Huh.
b^m	You are now.
sd	I've never used those.
b	Yeah,
qw	what kind of fish do you like the best to eat?
^g	do you ?
b@	 Yes,
sd^e	I've done fishing like that
ba	I know.
sd	they're sort of like, well, I want to say flies,
b	Yeah.
b^m	The yellow.
b	Okay .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
sv	Well, you sound like you're a good fisher woman, too.
sv	Well, I guess the, most interesting one that's, going on right now, from my perspective, is this, phenomena of, Ross Perot.
sd	I had heard other people talk about what they thought he believed in.
sd	But the whole phenomena of him coming out of, literally nowhere and no party. at least, no apparent party support on either side is pretty interesting.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Like out of nowhere?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd(^q)	one of the common criticisms of Clinton is, gee, he'll say or do anything in order to get to the White House.
sv	and, up and to the point of, Perot being a serious candidate, it seems like that was a requirement of being a contender within the party is to have done all those things.
sd	I mean, here's a guy who for twenty years has been working toward, you know, getting the party nomination and preparing himself for the presidency
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but he lost some eighteen elections before he finally won one.
sd	and the first and only election he won was, the presidency .
sd	he had lost every other office that he had, you know,
ny	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
nn	No,
sd	See now, that is where I want to go.
ba	I know.
b	Yeah,
qy	Is it?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	well I will. You know,
b^m	Maui.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I have been to California.
sd	I loved it.
b	Yeah,
sd	eighty six.
sd	My sister lives out there .
b	Yes.
b	Yeah,
ba	yeah.
^h	lets see I went when she was living,
sd	And then they moved to Piedmont.
sd	So I haven't seen, you know, her house in Piedmont
b	yeah.
sd	Went to Alcatraz.
b	Yeah.
sd	beautiful.
sd	And we went to Carmel.
sd	And we took the eighteen mile drive.
sd	it is beautiful.
sd	My girlfriend was down there a few months ago.
b	Yeah.
sd	I haven't been there either .
b	Uh huh.
ba	that is nice.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's nice.
bf	It is.
b	Uh huh.
qy	You don't get seasick?
b^m	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	yes.
t1	Was it to Alaska?
sd	She went last year.
sd	And, that I would like to go,
b	Yeah.
sd	well see, I am just in the Publisher's Clearing House and the READER'S DIGEST, because we don't, {F uh,
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	They showed a reporter and a copy editor how they went out
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I do too,
sd	you know, husband and wife, owners, who had never done this before.
sd	in terms of the credit,
sd(^q)	and I mean after we gave our fingerprints to the F B I, you, look at each other, yeah, you look at each other and say, well, , it's too late now.
sv	so I mean it's a matter of anybody can get it any way and how if they really try,
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^2	Positive for anything,
sd	And then now, I'm in corporate communications,
sd	and, part of that excuse me, was, as a new hire, that I had to take a drug test,
sd	and I had never been asked that
sv	I think that it's well
b	yeah,
sd	I don't know there should be some happy medium in terms of,
sv	I don't see a problem with that.
b	Yeah,
ar	You can't,
aa	Right,
sv	I mean, that kind of screening in general is a matter of exclusion.
sv	you hate to say that,
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	In terms of the privacy, yeah,
sv	and I think this is much stronger than, you know, pilots or, train engineers being screened,
sd	the transmission of the AIDS virus,
sd^r	The young girl that, contracted AIDS through her dentist, allegedly.
sd	And then they proved it,
sd	I don't know, I don't know if it's the old story that we are killing ourselves in general, or what,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
b	Yeah.
ba	very seriously,
ny	And, yeah,
sv	it's no better than journalism . except in journalism it's words,
sd	they picked them up off the street
qy	You know.
sd	Because, in our case, one is at the state and the other one is at the federal level. because you have to deal with the I N,
ny	Yeah
sd	they do that in Texas.
na	They don't do it for drugs,
b	Yeah,
sd	I'm old enough now where George Orwell,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
ad^t	Well look at what we're talking now,
fp^m	And good afternoon to you.
nn	no.
na	Right,
sd	Of course, dinner parties down here probably, turn out to be more things like barbecues .
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^m	Fried chicken.
b	Uh huh.
ny	yes,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right .
b	Uh huh.
b^m	improve upon that?
ny	Yeah.
sd	green beans and, carrots and things like that.
b^m	My green beans?
sd	I just get fresh green beans from the grocery store and snap off the ends and put them in water and steam them for about ten minutes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And it makes them pretty tasty.
b^m	The Chinese type.
nn	No,
b	Uh huh.
b^m	A white powder.
ba	gosh.
bd	That's okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	yes.
b^m	North African?
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
fc	yes.
fc	Okay,
fc^m	Bye bye.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, that is pretty impressive to have three books going.
b	yeah.
b	yeah
qy	do you like those detective stories?
ba	well that is interesting.
b	Yeah
b	Yeah,
ny	Yes.
b	Yeah,
sd	But, I have a lot of other hobbies.
b	Well, yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	To find broken,
sd	Well, essentially anything you find in a house. a stove, or oven or a broken piece of porcelain or, chipped tile on the floor. I mean just anything.
na	Well it is not anything elaborate.
sd	But, enough that, again for anything in the house I could probably,
aa	Right.
sd	I guess the car too.
sv	And so, I think I probably would consider that a hobby.
b	Yeah
b	Right.
qr	So, do you have any how do I say it, creative or artistic hobbies?
b	yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	I don't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art,
sd	I can't do any of that,
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	yeah.
ba	I see.
sv	I guess you could consider that a hobby.
sv	That's not something you,
ba	I understand that.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	Probably the other thing I do which I am sure will sound horrible to you, is I program for fun. on the computer.
sd	So, I have little computer projects going on that I consider hobbies.
sd	But, drive my wife crazy.
na	I do,
sd	In fact, there is actually several of them here right now.
sd	Not all of them being mine.
ny	Yeah.
qy	I wonder if you can construe raising children as being a hobby?
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
sd	And we had kind of a hard time finding someplace we could put Michael's goods ,
sd	and he was going to school at five.
sd	So, he started the first grade when he was five
sd^r	first grade when he was five years old.
aa	Yeah,
sd	we tried to find him someplace where he could learn something.
sd	And it was, mediocre expensive,
sv	but it's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	You know, my wife works
sd	so. We try to,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and we found a preschool for him.
sd	through other folks where I work,
sd	So, through other folks where we worked we found a nice preschool
sd	we, had those requirements,
b	Yeah.
sd	they still have unlicensed baby sitters running around up here
sv	You know, I think it's out of sight or out of mind, for less than, for more than, a minute or so.
^2	But you never know.
sv	as, as far as child abuse is these days you never know,
bf	you don't know who you can trust, and who you can't, you know.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
ba	Gee.
qy	Do you miss that part in your life
b	Yeah.
ba	I imagine,
b	yeah,
ad	anyway back to the subject,
sv	we should have discussed this earlier,
sd	it really is,
sd	and it's hard to find someplace where you can leave your child and trust that he's, going to be fine all day long.
b	Yeah,
sd	He's in first grade now,
sd	and he's, you know, got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade math level.
sd	So, you know, those early ages he would, you know, when his mom and dad are at work, and he's actually in child care in a preschool not, just child care, you know, we could have sent him to anybody, you know,
sd	there's a lot people at work that would have baby sat him but sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something, has paid off not only for us,
sd	his attitude is I think a little bit, tall for a six year old
^h	they were outside my marriage,
h	so, I don't know.
nn	I would say, no,
sd	they're really good,
sd	and I guess, no,
b	Yeah,
sd	so, we faced that too
sd	he learned quite a bit not only from nursery school
sd	and, you know, he's excelled
sd	sometimes he's a little bit smart mouthed,
sd	but he is smart , you know.
b	Yeah.
sd	but in Lubbock we have a few that you can send your children to
nn	No,
b	Yeah,
nn	so, no,
sd	Well, it would be nice, you know, there,
b	Yeah,
sd	and then some substitute teachers in the afternoon,
sd	and they actually taught him something instead of just watching him all day.
sd	You know, and then they had a group of kids
sd	and they did the Halloween thing, and the Valentine's Day things
sd	and you know, it was important to us,
sd	so you know, we took a good look at it and made sure it was going to go that way.
nn	No,
sv	I don't think he needed to be attached to too, even though he did,
sd	you know, he attached himself to a couple of those,
sd	but I think his attachments at home
^q	and this person can teach me one thing and this person teach me another
sd	He did well,
sd@	with another child I can't say that. Because I don't have that experience.
b	Yeah,
sd	so, I don't think we made too many mistakes.
sd	We tried hard.
b	Yeah,
sd	And he learned from it
^q	You know, maybe I'll clean my house, maybe I'll cook you lunch, maybe I won't, you know,
o@	and, Yeah,
b	yeah.
sd	but we had a good experience,
sd	and he served better than we did, you know,
sv	but I think in the long run he gained from it just being somewhere where we learned something, instead of just sitting around watching T V, and playing all day.
sv	And it's important.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	And we just didn't want to dump him somewhere, and make him feel like he wasn't wanted.
sd	And we wanted his center of attention at home
sd	and it worked out real well,
b	yeah,
sv	Most of the time now it's a necessity,
sv	you can't afford,
sd	so, you know, I'm not making seventy or eighty thousand dollars a year
b	Yeah,
sd	and, you know, I'm forty now
aa	Yeah,
aa	I'll agree with that, it is.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
sd	but every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally
sd	so we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh .
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
aa	Right.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
sd	he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health really.
b	Really .
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
br	Dr. Price?
b@	Huh uh. That's really interesting.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
qw	And what's the name of this book again?
sd	I'll have to remember that.
sd	That will be very interesting.
sd	And in fact, he's a, well, heart, too,
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
sd	If you get a chance read Dr. Cooper's book on controlling cholesterol.
sv	That's a real good,
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
b	really.
ba	That's good.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd^t	through Nancy Dahlgren.
sd	I don't think they're necessarily widespread in this country,
sd	Well, it's certainly not that difficult to tap a phone.
^h	and let's see,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sv	It's, you know, possible for a thirteen year old hacker with a modem to find out almost anything about your personal history, not to mention, change it if he wants to.
ny	Well, yes,
ng	not yet anyways, because I don't think they're widespread enough,
sv	 I'm not really sure, because the, I mean society is going more and more electronic,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I was a resident, although very young of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty nine when Alaska stopped being a territory and became a state.
ba	that's very interesting.
qr	Your concern on the economy was one in terms of, if it became a state would that put even more pressures on Puerto Rico, or pressures on the U. S. in terms of aid
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	I guess, we're assuming that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than say Mississippi
bk	Okay,
b	Uh huh.
aa	I see what you mean,
b	Uh huh,
sd	And I think, having listened to you relative to the economy thing, I think if I were being forced to make a decision I would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these.
sv	I think I would be troubled,
sd	I am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines,
sd	And Canada, I guess, comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever.
b	Yeah,
sd	and I'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language.
sv	But I'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level.
sd	I'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness I guess.
sd^t	Well I think we have gone to time
fc	Good bye.
aa	Yes,
nn	No.
sd	I avoid them with all ,
aa	Yeah,
sv^m	but they are a lot of work.
sd	I usually have them when there is a special event in our lives
sd	And, I think I am most, happiest with my most, familiar foods that I know are successful.
sd	You know, and I make my own pies and pie crust
sd	I do not need a recipe to follow.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yes .
b	Uh huh.
fe	My word,
ba	Wonderful.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah
sd	and, you know, it has got to be gone or daddy gets into you know, the leftovers.
sd	Puts about two more inches on his waistline
b	Uh huh.
nn	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	okay.
b	Sure,
bf	Like apple pie in America,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes,
sd	Well, when I have a dinner party that is my motivation for getting the, house clean .
b	Yeah,
sd	it's at her house,
sd	So she has got to hire this crew, of four women to come in two weeks prior to the wedding and get it ready.
b	Yes,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure,
aa	That's right,
b	Uh huh.
qy	Have you?
bc	Egg and sugar.
b	Uh huh.
nn	no,
sd	like the liquid is like, a half cup of water and then your egg and then your tablespoon of vinegar,
sd	and you mix that together
sd	it's quite a volume of,
sd	I think it's four cups of floor,
sd	and, like, a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar
sd	and then you, put in your liquid.
sd	It just, it just makes it very pliable and, and very flaky,
sd	and, you can really treat it rough
sd	Like, it's not mine,
b	Uh huh.
ba	wow.
sd	Detroit,
b	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	yes.
sd	Born in Detroit.
b	yeah,
cc	Well, then, I'll walk softly.
b	Yeah.
qw	What school system does she teach in?
ba	wow.
arp	Well, I think it's more of a,
sd	to give you an example, both of my children are in the academy system in the Garland School District,
sv	And most of,
b	Yeah
b	Yeah.
sv	And, that also probably crosses over into business, because now, businesses also say that if you're don't have the proper education, including, exposure to high tech fields such as computer technology, if you can't use a computer today and do word processing and do, data base management and do, I forget all the other stuff, financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your regular job, you can't function you know.
sv	So I think that the school system proliferates over to the business world
sd	Well, I alternate between Danielle Steele is one of my very favorites
sd	it is it is wonderful.
bk	Okay.
b	yes.
sd	I try to keep a book going all the time.
sd	in fact this morning, I was almost late for work because I'm almost at the end of this book
sd	But I like mysteries.
ny	yes,
aa^m	Ludwig, yes.
sd	And, I like Jeffrey Archer.
sd	He is an English author who writes some mystery.
b	Right,
ar	No,
sd	it's late,
b	Uh huh.
sd	it was his first book.
ny	Yes.
b	Okay,
nn	No,
sv	you always cry.
sd	I mean, it's always good for good tears.
sd	it's always going to make you have a good cry
sd	I don't want anything too real anymore.
b	Uh huh.
na	I do my share of it.
sd	I was going to say, you played pro ball,
b^m	Not quite,
b	Oh.
ny	Yeah,
sd	I never quite found a New York fan.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
qy^d	so you were pretty close.
h	Well, I don't know. there's a part of me that says that, you know, I'm sort of glad Strawberry went away.
sd	I think they're okay,
sv	I mean, certainly if you look at them compared to, let's say, you know, eight years ago or something, they're they're, they're, they're, you know, they're sort of in good standing, whereas, you know, I certainly don't think they're the eighty six team any more.
b	Yeah,
na^m	Right,
na	That's right,
b	Right,
aa	That's right,
sd	So, I, I was, I was also, I was in school at Boston at the time.
sd	it was actually wonderful because where I was they were half Met fans and, half Sox fans.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
ba	Well, that's good,
sv	You don't expect them to be, much of anything but thugs.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	actually, I think I make something, because I think,
sv	You know, it's good to have,
aa	Yes,
b	Right.
ba	that's great.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
ng	I haven't been to any Toronto games yet.
aa^m	Of stadiums, yeah,
sd	Cornell is in Ithaca.
b	yeah,
sd	So if you know where Lake Ontario is sort of.
ny	Yeah,
sv	Actually whoever built the city was an idiot, in my opinion, because they built it far enough from the city that it actually couldn't be a port city.
sd	really, I hadn't actually known that.
sd	Well, but we have our own triple A team here
sd	the Redwings, which are they're a farm team for the Orioles.
sd	So everybody hopes that, they go all the way around here.
ny	yeah,
sd	Lots of really big,
o	especially,
sd	But they really seem to,
sv	those are, I think those are more fun than major league games sometimes.
aa	Yes,
sv	you know, I guess when you start pitching real well, well, move them up. Bam .
b	Yeah,
sv	Well, the way I see it, is,
sd	If you'll think back a few years to when the Mets were just all this sort of young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but weren't very sort of, well trained
sd	you know, back to, you know, maybe eighty, eighty four or eighty three or eighty five, you know, when they weren't quite the eighty six team that, that they were.
sv	that probably gives the readers a good shot for you this year or next year, I think, if, I think, the young talent really just has to build itself up.
aa	Right,
ba	that must be nice.
o@	Well, that isn't too bad. Just a couple of hours.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sv	I mean, I mean, it's almost four hundred,
sv	so, it's, it's, you know, it's a heck of a drive.
bc	Toronto.
sd	Toronto's only about two hours,
sd	Toronto, I mean, I want to go see.
na	I can,
sd	Haven't taken it yet, though.
b	Yeah,
nn	no,
sd	Some place south, and warm,
sd	right now we're actually having,
ba	that's great.
^h	Because it, didn't make the national news too much, which I find really weird
sd	There were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive.
b	Yeah,
sd	and so many, things like that,
ny	Well, yes,
sd	I, haven't been out all year.
aa	Yes,
^2	And the little critters that are around.
aa	That's right
sv	More than competitiveness against someone else.
sd	Or you'll hear thirty and think, boy I got my game together.
sd	I've had a par and a birdie, and a bogey
b	Oh.
ad	You really should go at least once.
sd	Tulsa
sv	I mean, it's like a bullet going by.
sd	And, you know, to see their concentration and yet to see how friendly they are when they're, walk by you, you know, and how good they are to their spectators.
b	Yes.
aa	Yes,
sv	The scrambles are fun.
sd	I belong to the country club there in El Reno when I lived there
sv	on those, you really go out for fun.
sd	And, you know, you won't,
aa	That's right.
sd	And, now that was very competitive.
sd	And, I enjoyed it tremendously,
sd	And if it takes one of us ten shots to get up to the green, so be it.
sd	You know, we just think, well, the next time has got to be better .
b	yes,
qy	Does your club have a good woman's association?
sv	It's hard to be a weekend golfer and improve your game.
sd	it's, it's a, it's a good game.
ng	Well, ourselves, we have , I guess never had to look for child care.
sd	Our kids are now fourteen and eighteen.
sd	I guess, we were in a situation where we didn't need to be looking at, two family income at the time .
sd	And our kids were older.
sd	my involvement hasn't been direct
qo	How about yourself?
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	But even, you know, here. I guess we have in one sense two forms of, child care.
sd	And that will be groups of anywhere from one or two to, maybe, seven or eight children.
sd	And then otherwise, there will be
sd	But, at the same time, there's some fairly good training programs and some of them formal two year programs.
sd	you know, there is some definite, creative play, good social interaction, that kind of thing.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	it's, typically, whether it's been child care in a home or in a larger situation where actually it's more of an institution.
sd	And you've actually got children that most people would consider problem children
nn	Well, no
qo	what about you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Well now is that, that's related to the aerobic, ,
bk	Okay.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Well, okay.
qy^d	do you like to do it with other people.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
^2	In terms of motivation and incentive,
b	Yeah.
sd	when I have run and jogged,
sd	the chan , the change of pace and just getting out and around
sd	and I find that I can often, you know,
sd	and, also that, my subconscious is working on things while I'm working
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
ba	Well good,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
qy^g	They're not quite elderly, .
b	Uh huh.
ng	not for my parents.
sd	and that killed him .
ny	Well, yeah,
sd	And he just kind of became a vegetable and died.
sd	So but that was a long time ago.
sd	That was, back in like seventy three.
sv	So, I think the way they did things were a lot different back then.
sd	And, my grandmother, his wife we also put her in a rest home.
sd	She was in a rest home
sd	and so she was able to come back home
sd	and then } she had to go back in a couple of times,
sd	but mostly it was just because she kind of gave up.
sd	So I guess as far as looking,
aa	it is .
sv^m	It is expensive.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^2	When she can't take care of herself.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qrr	or she can go down to the cafeteria?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	they have well quite a few of those places like that here in Utah
sv	I think it really takes, you know, looking more at the people than even really the facilities.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yes.
sv	they wanted to do things.
sv	Well, Cathy, I think that, capital punishment certainly has a place in our society, maybe from the sense that there are some things that we just can't afford to have repeated, even in the remote chance of repetition.
aap	That might be true,
qy	do we say that every one who commits murder in the first degree is liable for capital punishment if that's what the jury decides is an appropriate punishment for their crime,
no	Well, either, you know.
aa	Yes,
sv	you know, if we lived in a different country, then murder is not so bad.
sv	But over here, where we're promised the civil liberties of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, then taking that away is a heinous act.
h	I don't know.
aa	I tend to agree with you there.
sv	these people had a choice of committing this crime, that involves the taking of another's life or the altering of someone's life such as rape, deserves punishment by death.
sd	But then I'm also told that I'm a pretty harsh person.
b	All right,
sv	You know, that second group of people falls into the group that I say give up their rights,
aa	That's right
sv	I think I would probably lower the age to about fourteen.
h	and I certainly don't know myself,
qy@	You know, I have an eighteen year old,
sd	we live in a one story, just like a style home, you know, the standard Texas, Fox and Jacobs.
qo	How about you guys?
sv	Well, they say those are or difficult to find.
qw	How are rents doing?
b	Uh huh.
qw	what's a one bedroom,
sd	well, Plano,
b	Uh huh.
ba	 that does get high,
b	Yeah,
sd	so that's really not,
sd	actually they're near Plano in North Dallas too,
b	Yeah.
sv	And then I think that, nobody was really buying houses there for a long time there because of just,
aa^m	that's really about it,
qw^d	So you know what it's like,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	You know, I used to think that Dallas was better than Houston because their zoning for where you can put a house next to a,
sv	now it looks just like Houston to me.
sd	We've been in here ten years.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sd	My home town.
sd	The prices, actually, a lot better, because Pittsburgh is about the size, I've been trying to think, like a Louisville, or Minneapolis, that type of size.
sd	And the prices, what you get here for about a hundred thousand you could get there for about seventy five, eighty.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sv	and here I guess it depends on what you want,
sv	and a lot of the people that came from that area, probably like what you're talking about, they had a lot of property but not a lot of house,
sv	but they love it.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	And I said, You haven't heard about tornados .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yep.
aa	That's exactly,
sv	but, the housing is just,
br	Pardon me?
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	you know, it's,
br	Pardon me?
ny	Yes,
nn	No,
^h	how do we take care of the house.
sd	I don't have,
sd	We have a,
nn	no,
sd	we pretty much hire,
sd	I mean, I know how to fix a running toilet
sd	he does what he needs to,
aa	Yeah,
qy	Have you ever done that,
qo	And how'd that go?
b	Uh huh.
sd	Getting to agree to things, I'm sure,
sv	the dollar value on things I,
sv	you know, I think people that own homes a lot in North Dallas are very materialistic.
sd^t	I know I'm supposed to talk about homes,
b	Yeah,
aa	Right,
ba	my goodness
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qw	how is apartment dwelling living in terms of general privacy and noise and things like that?
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes,
qy^d	Everybody pretty much keeps , keeps to their own turf, so to speak.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Relax and try to go to sleep,
sv	I think Plano in general is getting a little more,
b^m	Or something,
sv	so it's an investment,
aa	Yeah,
b	All right.
b	Yes.
bf	We talking from dents in the holes.
ba	I understand,
sv	Kids are hard on houses.
b	Yeah,
sd	what we have,
sd	And, seems like we're always working on it, as I'm sure, it is with your house.
b	Yeah.
sd	Ten,
nn	No,
ny	Yes.
ny	Yeah,
nn	no,
ny	yes.
qw	What division are you in?
b	Oh.
sv^t	It's not a hobby, you know,
qy^g^t	It's interesting, isn't it?
sd^t	You know, the gal I talked to in Maryland, didn't own a car,
sd	she, lives on campus,
sd	her parents live by the public transportation.
aa	Well, it would be nice
b	Right.
sv	If it's anything like,
sv	Dallas always has been,
qy	Is the crime rate still bad?
b	Yeah.
sd	So, Garland, how nice is it now,
aa	Yes,
b	Well, yeah,
qw	Where you from?
b^m	Kilgore,
sd	I'm originally from Lubbock.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Seemed like the thing to do at the time.
sd	I love it, the mountains.
ad	back to the topic,
sv	it seems that, more and more people are not owning traditional homes these days.
b	Yeah,
sv	But now it seems that, with the local economy bad and T I
sv	they're doing some back pedaling.
nn	No,
ba	Gosh.
sv	Well, mobile homes have changed a lot probably since you had one.
sd	ours is wood sided,
sd	and it has a traditional V top , roof,
sd	and, it's nine hundred and eighty square foot.
sd	Well, you can imagine nine hundred eighty square foot broke up into two bedrooms, one bath,
sd	it's comfy.
o@	I, don't know whether it is or not.
sd	It was already setup when we bought it.
b	yeah,
sd	our payments are like two twenty.
sd	Fifteen.
br	And, what?
b	Yeah,
sd^e	it did.
nn	No,
sd	So, you know, there's not that much time left on the loan
h	I, don't know.
ng	to tell you the truth right now it feels kind of comfy to have our mobile home and have it so close to paid for.
na	Sure.
na	Sure,
na	absolutely.
h	I don't know
sd	six or seven.
na	a little bit,
ba	that's exciting.
sv	the policy that T I has, I think is, very fair.
sd	they first had a policy where they, would test new employees
aa	Yes.
aa	And it is,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and, and, you know, I saw,
sd	you know, I know my friends who were you know, druggies and, friends who weren't
sv	and, and, you know, I think it's a real problem,
sv	and I think it's causing us a lot of trouble and, and a lot of problems.
sd	And so I'm hoping that, a lot of other companies will follow the same path.
ng	probably not.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yep.
sd^e	Very aware of it.
sv	I mean, I'd like to know that my child's being taught by a teacher who's not on drugs or, or, who might be at a point where they're trying to sell my kid drugs.
b	Yeah.
sv	And, I like the idea that they have a, system where they allow you to, be retested if for, some reason there may have been a problem. or something did show up.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sv	That's not going to help anybody get over the problem.
sv	I believe it is a, a medical problem.
sv	of course I also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world, too .
b	Yeah,
sv	I'm just glad that they, decided not to, tax drugs, otherwise they'd be legal,
sv	and they'd be getting tax money off it the same way, they are the alcohol and tobacco .
b	Yeah.
sd	and I moved to a T I facility that, had never had, random drug sampling before, because they were outside of the military sector.
sd	It was, an industrial company, you know, that T I purchased,
sd^r	they were really opposed to it,
sd	and, you know, there was a few of them that obviously were doing drugs,
sv	and that's why they were opposed to it.
sd	And, it resulted in a few people leaving, you know, because they just flat out weren't going to put up with the policy.
sd	You know, they had a life style
b	Yeah.
qh	I mean, you know, why do I need my eyes checked,
qh	You know it's like, why are we doing this?
sv	I mean, it's the basic premise with, you know, drug testing.
sv	Especially some of the jobs,
sd	and it's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as, you know, hurting someone, I mean,
sv	it's hard to imagine somebody misusing a computer and somebody dying from it,
sv	But, in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor, and down in some of those labs and stuff, yeah, darn if I'd want somebody down there that I'm working with side by side, you know, that could kill me, by doing something incorrectly because they were not exactly all there because they were on drugs.
sv	So, there's a lot of sectors where I think that would, would help out,
sv	you know, if you're not working with someone on drugs, well then you're going to have less accidents,
sv	and you have less accidents
sv	And you spend less money on medical, then the company's more profitable.
sv^r	The company's more profitable, then maybe they can pay you more.
sv	If they can pay you more, you can buy more,
sv	and it goes around, you know, to everywhere.
b	Yep,
aa	It certainly does
sd	and, and start it up.
sd	Well, a lot of companies are, coming down in price,
sv	and I think that the insurance companies are starting to give, benefits.
sd	You know, reduction in medical costs if, you know, they,
b	Yeah,
sv(^q)	And I think if a lot more insurance companies get on the bandwagon and say, well if you impose, mandatory drug testing, we'll reduce your insurance costs by, you know, twenty per cent.
sv	And of course, you know, the company's not going to reduce the employee's cost of insurance twenty per cent, they're going to reduce their own.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
fc^m	It was great talking with you.
fc	You do the same.
fc^m	Bye bye.
qw	First how much television watching do you do?
b	Uh huh.
b	That's right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Right.
^h	Well, actually, I work full time
sd	If there's something that I absolutely want to watch I will turn it on and watch it and then turn it off.
sd	if I do not find something that I really want or really want to watch, well, then I just do not turn it on.
sv	Part of it is that, I think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis
b	Yeah.
aa	right,
b@	 I,
na	Well, last night, for example, I really would have liked to have watched UNSOLVED MYSTERIES.
sd	If I have the opportunity, I watch it.
sd	I hate that.
sd	In our comedy programs, although,
b	Uh huh.
o@	That's right, and some of those are fine programs.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I enjoy comedy.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I enjoy that,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	That's right.
b	Uh huh
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
aa^m	and it was fabulous.
sd	I was just absolutely,
sv	you just held you breath, in some of those.
sd	I was just,
sd	I may or may not even look at the T V guide,
b	Uh huh.
aa	I do too,
sd	and then I eat,
sd	I think that's, marvelous.
b	Yeah.
sd	it's very successful for some of, those things,
sv	but I think I really got stung very badly about having influence in your life,
sd	and, I want you to know that became the most suspicious, cantankerous, contrary old woman ever walked.
aa	Absolutely,
sd	And for her to miss a soap, it was a big withdrawal.
h	Well, I do not know.
sd	Well, she was grumpy to begin with.
sv	There's no doubt about that,
sd	I know that one day, my youngsters were watching THE THREE STOOGES,
sd	but when one tries to lift the other one up with a pipe wrench, I decided that was not funny, any more.
sv	And, I really, I really feel very strong about the BART SIMPSON SHOW.
sv	I think that is,
sd	Mine are grown,
sv	and, for a four year old to think Bart Simpson is a hero is tragic .
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I was very careful even when my kids were, kids were at home.
sd	And when they were young I really did, watch what they watched.
sd@	you know, I distracted them, changed their interest. Because I just could not tolerate that kind of influence on the kiddos.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh
b	Uh huh.
na	Sure,
aa	Absolutely,
sd	maybe we need to go outside,
sd	and we need to go out and play and enjoy some company.
b	Yeah.
b	Of course,
o	Ok ,
b	Oops .
b	Well, okay,
ny	Yeah,
sd	well, I guess since this time last year I've changed, jobs within the firm I'm with
sd	and, I now am learning to be a sys admin on, not only P C s, but, professional work stations as well.
sd	And these are the big mamas, i. e. sons, Hewlett Packards, the big Solburns and so forth.
sd	and, we have, two P C s here.
sd	And so we got one that, that could do enough, and, you know, hold three different O S s. As far as DOS, UNIX, and, O S Two.
sd	So, I get to see all kinds of different applications.
bd	No,
qh	but, expert,
b	And, yeah,
sd	and we have two P C s here at home.
sd	a lot of the, the new mama we're,
sd	I, I've found that, the more we do with it,
sv(^q)	So, rather than being niggardly and, chintzy, we've just said, you bet, boss, seeing as he was the one that, enabled us to get the money to buy the Four Eighty Six.
sd	Because the top of the line we've got,
ny	Uh huh,
sd	Like I said we bought a real steam burner. mainly because of spouse's UNIX because UNIX takes a, a well, four megs minimum of RAM
sd	and then, it, it likes to live on about a hundred and fifty megabyte hard drive.
sd	So the next size up was a Two Hundred and Eleven
sd	And, speak of the angel, she just walked in .
t3	T I stuff .
ny	Yeah,
o	Okay.
^2	Television news?
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	on commercial radio, I guess, I tend to get more of my news from national public radio of the morning on the way to work, or evening on the way to school
sd	so, So, I don't, I don't see much T V mostly when I'm in school,
sd	but I do here.
sd	University of Texas at Dallas.
b	Right.
b	Really.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
sd^m	That's about it,
b	Right.
sd	I like to listen to, national public radio on the way to work because I don't know, it's variety,
sd	It tends to get like HEADLINE NEWS if you listen to it for an hour .
ny	Yeah,
sd	and they present different sides of things.
sd	well they spend a little more time, you know,
sd	and then they go into a lot of the issues and things where they spend five or ten minutes discussing something and, interviewing people.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	I haven't listened to a top forty radio station in so long I wouldn't know.
sd	And I guess I get some kinds of other, you know, business related news through trade journals and things
b	Right .
b	Yeah,
sd	it takes a lot more time to read something,
sd	and you've got news, bombarding you from everywhere now.
sd	You know you, turn on the T V, turn on the radio.
qw	Why is that?
b	Yeah,
sv	I find it hard to believe that people will go back to reading over television, I mean, just given the way society is.
aa	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	they give you headlines that are brief,
sv	And it's informative.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
sv	Communication, you know, expands the world now.
sv	There's too much going on.
b	Yeah.
qh	And the question is, or how, some of it,
qh	is it the true story
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	I, you know, I like to know what's going on.
sv	You know you get in the habit of, like I say, turn on Headline News
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
qh	Like who cares?
ny	Yeah.
sd^e	Trying to do some C programming.
fc	Okay .
fc	Take care.
fc	Bye bye.
aa	Okay,
na	there're some places that are strongly encouraging it,
sd	Well, it turns out that so much,
sd	it requires essentially a paper mill to recycle it,
b	Yeah,
qy	Well, do you do recycling?
b	Oh.
qy	Well, do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans?
bf	so it's worth taking them back.
sd	that's it,
sd	In fact I almost went to work for them.
sd	But, it's an interesting point, though, that, you know, everybody's so anxious to recycle,
sv	Well, but in general I think it's a good idea because like the glass, you can't argue that the glass,
sd	it doesn't biodegrade, and, the plastics obviously,
sv	So we might as well recycle those.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, that's what we've got.
b	Yeah.
sv	But every little bit helps,
qy	Well, do you have separate trash cans at your desk.
sd	Well, we have one that's recyclable and then for lunch sacks and waste food
sd	and, one day they'll pick up,
sd	Depending on how much,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	That's an interesting distinction.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, see, well, see, those of us that don't have state income taxes,
sd	and, it's interesting what people get upset about,
nn	Well, no,
sd	We're not civilized now, you cannot drink beer and drive,
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, you know, the other, Well the other thing is, it also is a, is a good habit, to, just to conserve resources, you know, you know, because you get in the habit of that, you think in terms of, of, of things like saving
sd	I like the Giants.
sd	so, but I just like the Giants.
ny	Yeah,
^2	The way he handled that entire situation, there.
sd	But, I just think the Giants have a good team.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	but. it's kind of hard.
sd	about the most baseball we get is either T V or we play it on Nintendo.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
h	I don't know, it's hard to say.
sv	but, like I say, if they can get that one element that they were missing, I think the Giants can do it.
sd	I don't really know about the A s.
aa	Yeah.
sd	He ramming his wife's car,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	But I hope they can do good.
sd	they probably just need something to push them because that's the only thing I can see that's holding them back, is the ambition to do it.
sd	Or somebody basically,
ny	Yeah,
sd	so, he had his year this year,
sd	we, we got into that a whole bunch.
sv	that was a series to remember, for sure.
sd	So I saw all seven games of that,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
sd	I can't figure out why.
qh	so, why keep on doing something that didn't work,
ny	Yeah,
sv	Well, baseball's baseball.
sd^t	I don't know, it's kind of odd they pick,
na	Alright,
qw	Where did you go on your last vacation?
br	What?
b	Uh huh,
b	yeah.
bh	Really?
qw	What kind of, vacation spots are there in Colorado?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I think my parents took me there when I was real young.
qy	You drive by yourself up there?
ba	wow.
sv	that's tough.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
sd	Sure is pretty up there.
qy	You have mountains all around you?
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow,
qy@	Have you ever been out of the United States for, vacation? Or business?
b	Uh huh.
sd	It was really neat,
br	What?
ny	Yeah,
sd	It was really pretty down there.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and they had never been to the United States,
sd	They had been to Disneyland,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	wow.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
br^m	Pacific Science?
bh	Really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	wow.
qy^g	That's the vacation you recommend,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
ba	wow.
b	Uh huh.
b@	Oh. Uh huh.
qy	And your car is on a ferry?
qy	And it goes across with you?
ba	That's really neat.
^2	To work?
ba	That's really wild.
b	Huh.
br^m	Hour and ten minutes?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
br^m	Galveston?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I've heard it's really pretty.
bh	Really?
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I've heard to go to Austin too.
qw	What's there to see in Austin?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right .
b	Yes.
b	Yes.
sd	well, we don't have any children
sd	And, we like Indian food, and Thai cuisine and, sort of gourmet Mexican and, things like that, as well as Tex Mex and Italian and, Chinese and things, and things of that sort.
sd	And, we probably go out one to two times a week.
sd	And, we're pretty much regulars at an local Italian restaurant.
sd	Momo's.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've heard about it,
b	Uh huh.
sd	that's one of the things, a good pasta means a lot to me.
aa	Yes,
sd	And I'm not fond of some of those things
sd	we've had Ethiopian. And, not in Plano of course .
sd	But, we really do enjoy going out
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	When a new restaurant opens up, they usually send out coupons.
sd(^q)	And you know, when they say, you know, buy one get one free. It's hard to resist,
sd	But we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons, and the other half through the newspaper reviews.
sd	I mean it's wonderful, particularly if you have more than two people and you've got say four or something like that.
b	So, yeah
b	Yes.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah.
aa	yes.
sd	m , m , my sister, who also lives here in Dallas, tends to, chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner, which drives me absolutely batty.
qw	What's your favorite restaurant?
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
sd	You know, we've never been there.
sd	And that's supposed to be wonderful.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Ooh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I would probably like that.
sd	that's supposed to be a wonderful place.
aa	I certainly can't argue with that.
sd	I think it's, Four or five,
aa	Right,
sd	So, if it's your peers and you're not educated then,
sv	You want you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them.
sv	So, I think the jury selection process is pretty neat,
sd	and many times I've seen on trials they have on T V, the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever,
sv	and I think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure. As opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure. Also, may be a more consistent sentencing procedure.
sd	Well, preceding criminal record, according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime.
sd	At least in California, they're supposed to be.
sv	But when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down, I think that they should.
sd	I don't know that they always have because I never sat all the way through a jury trial.
sv	Well, if it's a second offense, the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense, because obviously, the rehabilitation process did not work the first time.
sv	I think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Well, say, embezzlement, right.
qr	Weather wise, or otherwise?
b^m	Weather wise.
sd	we have gone through, what might be called the four seasons, in the last week.
sd	We have had highs of seventy two, lows in the twenties.
sd	I heard about that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	The blue flu,
b	yeah,
sd	as I've said, we have had variable weather.
sd	But, we've had an unusually, warm spring,
sd	to speak of.
sd	I thought I heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh
sd	But, otherwise as I said, we have had, a relatively mild winter, speaking for this area of the country.
ba	yes.
sv	Well, you are not from that area originally, I can tell.
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see.
sd	Well, I worked for the government,
sd^t	but, I guess this is my first conversation in this, series.
sd^t	I received a call last night because of the,
sd^t	So, I had to call Jack Godfrey today to ask him what it was, because I had to abort the call last evening because I couldn't get on the line.
qy	So, is there any,
nn	No,
sd^t	And, I was sent an application from Jack.
sd	I've known Jack for some time.
sd^t	so I was very much interested, in being a speaker for this .
bk	I see.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area. If just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative,
sd^t	but I have been a speaker in other, similar type of activities.
sd^t	And, I know the reason why the, this is being gathered and the program and so forth,
sd	We haven't talked much about the weather .
sd^t	I know that's what we're supposed to do.
b	Uh huh.
qy	is that with regard to work place engineering, or just, you know, the work place environment
bk	I see.
b	Uh huh.
sd^t	The call I received,
sv	but that's interesting.
sd	And, one of his,
sd	And, one of the,
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see.
ba	Well, that's interesting.
sd	I'm already on my job
sd^t	so, you reached me at my job.
sd	my dress for work, most of the time is, rather comfortable and casual usually, slacks and a soft colored shirt.
sd	The, thing that distinguishes me a lot of the time when I have to dress real professionally for a meeting or something is I wear a clerical collar and a suit and, all of that sort of thing,
sd	but when I don't need to dress up for a meeting or a service of some sort, I don't.
ny	Yes.
sv	Well, around there you can probably wear, T shirts and other things,
sd	today we wear coats
sd	but I don't think there's an escape from light jackets.
sd	The wind will take away a lot of body heat.
na	Very similar.
aa	No,
sd	As I say, unless it happens to be,
sd	but then I can go home later in the day and be a little more casual
sd	and then if I have a meeting of people that I know, I can be very casual in the evening.
b	Yeah,
sd	I mean, there are expected, dress codes
sd	and the people need to follow that.
sd	but I've relaxed a lot more as I've gotten older and become more comfortable with myself.
sd	It's taken a long time to break away, from that
sd	but now that I've broken away from it, I'm glad I have.
bf	You mean you don't need to wear little old house dresses any more?
ba	That's a good idea,
aa	No,
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	we can wear pretty much that, although, tennis shoes are kind of out in almost every, every situation unless you want to look like a gook .
b^m	A lot different.
fc	You too,
fc	Uh huh.
fc	Bye.
sd	Well, actually my hobbies now are T shirt making.
sd	right now I'm making Christmas ones with poinsettias and bears and all that kind of thing.
nn	no,
sd	So, it's real fun.
sd	Pretty good.
sd	I guess in my spare time I'll be making T shirts .
aa	That's right, you know.
aa	That's correct.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my gosh.
qw	Well, how'd you learn to do that to fix them up?
qr	You just get a book that tells you how to do it or what?
b	Uh huh.
qw	Where'd you get the car?
ba	Wow.
aa	Well, that's true,
^h	Let's see.
^h	Well, let's see,
aa	Uh huh,
^h	So. Let's see,
sd	Probably about twenty.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	they all play different songs.
b^m	The most expensive.
sd	bought a few of them.
aa	That's true .
sd	I have dolls from all over too.
sd	economy.
ny	Uh huh
sd^r	in was in high school.
sd	everything was like an hour or two hours at the Louvre, you know, things like that where you need the whole day,
aa	Exactly,
nn	No,
sd	Well, he likes it all right.
sd	Well, actually, I've had a couple of different situations.
aa	It certainly is .
sd	But, mostly we just spent cash. Whatever we had.
sd	Late thirties,
sd	And, my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house.
sd	And that's the way I've operated ever since then.
ba	my .
ba	my!
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	my.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	It's time for you to do these things then. Right?
ba	This is so funny.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well that's the thing, see, you know,
sv	But if you're going to be more professional oriented, then you've got to have this, to be able to perform well on the job
b	Uh huh.
qw	What will you,
bk	okay,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sv	and they need that, you know, to be able to relate to other people besides the same person every day.
b	Yeah,
sv	and someone's got to do it, and be able to do it right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, so that's another thing that has to adapt is, you know, the father's attitudes about, you know, whose job is this.
sv	Well, it's his job too.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd(^q)	And a man might say out loud, well, you know, I understand this
sv	and that's a very hard attitude to change.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and I think that's happened in a lot of cases.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but sometimes, it's baby sitting.
sv	It's someone, you know, keeping an eye on the kids
^q	and here's what wrong,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
aa	No.
na	Sure,
sd	I'll offer anything that I can on the subject.
sd	So, it had to have everything done from top to bottom to having it leveled, jacked up, new plumbing, new wiring, wallpaper, paint,
sd	Well, I really did enjoy it, you know,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It is.
sd	So, that's really why we ended up in a house like this.
sd	so, you know, I'm ready to get ahold of another one that I can have a little more input into
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
sv	it is,
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
bf	That's where I need to go .
aa	Exactly.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	no.
qy	For forty dollars?
ba	my.
b	Uh huh.
^2	Something.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I bet.
aa	Yeah,
^h	Well, let me ask you,
sd	and, you know, they have to be doing something constantly.
sd	But they have a problem with these little like sand bugs or something that drill in between all these bricks.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Okay,
b	Uh huh.
bf	As tight as you can.
sd	but, they just haven't brought themselves to do it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
bf	And then she won't have to worry about it.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
am	it might do it,
b	Uh huh.
na	I know,
sd	But, gosh, you know, I ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that house, up the stairway, even.
sd	You know, I just had a ball with it,
sd	it was so much fun.
b	Yeah.
sd	and she has that up in her attic
b	yes .
aa	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
sv	If it's not raining.
qy	are you down here in Texas?
b	Okay,
b	Oh.
b	Okay, ,
aa	Yeah,
sd^c	I have to answer a business phone .
fa^t	I hate to do it on this call.
t3	Good morning, A R E, this is Arlene Lister .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	when my big kids were little, you know, ev , all the mothers were home.
sd	You know, the kids got up in the morning and ate breakfast and poked around
sv	And, I think it's gotten, very different.
sd	and, other than that, I mean, there was not educational T V
sd	But, we always did, just, you know, to the park for walks and to the zoo and museum.
sd	We did a lot of stuff like that with our kids.
sd	And, course, when they got bigger, they were both quite into sports
sv	and, , a girl is very different .
sv	So, they're very different,
sd	like last night was a band concert
sd	and she plays on her school volleyball team and, stuff like that.
sd	One of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at College Station
sd	we go down there fairly often, you know, for a weekend for, you know, family get togethers and stuff like that.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yes.
sd	and this time of the year it, the fun thing was to go out and swoosh around in the leaves , you know.
sd	So, You know, so it's very different
sd	and, you know, come winter time we'd stick them on sleds.
sd	and from little on, you know,
sd	you know, I assume, that the major sources are cars and factories.
sd	But I, I don't know for sure.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I guess there's been a lot of pressure to, do away with the C F C's in these spray bottles which, has been a real problem.
na	Again that's what I hear
aa	Well, it is scary
sv	We've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment.
sd	I, I'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't, do that.
sd	In Los Angeles they're apparently going to,
sd	and it's really bad in places like Los Angeles,
sd	and, it's not too bad around here although you see it, you know, more and more in the sky.
sv	and our economy seems to,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well that makes a lot of sense.
b	Yeah.
aa	No,
b	Yeah,
sv	and, we're going to feel it,
sv	and in this country, the solution that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable.
sd	And, I have a little sports car that I enjoy using
ng	I don't really think we have anything in the works as of yet.
sd	we're a pretty small town
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
sv	that would be good.
b	Yeah,
sd	But that's as far as we go
sd	and and I don't want the hassle because we have to go to another town to do it.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow, that's excellent.
ba	That's good.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Exactly.
aa	Yeah,
sd	It just, you know, there's not a whole lot.
sd	But usually it, it hasn't caught on yet.
b	Yeah.
sd	I wasn't totally aware of that.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd^t	I can't either. Because we're at a very, you know, beginning stages,
sd	We look forward to it to get better .
aa	Yeah,
fc	You too.
fc	Bye.
ny	Uh huh.
qy	baseball?
sd	Well, I've kind of , been intrigued with the Rangers, more so with, their management than anything else.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I think that, you know, with, so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money, it's, you know, I think
b	Yeah
sd	but a little bit you know, from thirty million dollars or thirty five mil ,
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sv	And I really think that they ought to,
qh	And then, who knows,
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	So, you know, he's real happy there.
br^m	The pitching coach?
sd	Well, you know, I was just looking at the news tonight,
sv	And I think that's a great addition.
qy^g	you don't like Howse,
br^m	Tom Grieve?
b	Yeah.
qy^g	You do,
sd	That's contrary to, popular belief, you know .
aa	I know .
sv	They need to have some young guys that can take the lead
ny	Yeah,
sd	Was not a big deal
sd	two little deals,
ny	Yeah,
sd	but I know I can do it.
sd	And the second one was I bought some toys at a craft fair.
sd	They're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a little girl for Christmas,
sd	Well, it, that's half the problem right there is that it was a oil base,
sd	I mean, I kind of knew, in the back of my mind,
nn	Well, no,
aa	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
qy	Have you painted anything recently.
qy	Wow, was it huge?
b	Yeah.
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah,
nn	No,
sd	I went around the trim,
sd	it came right off
sd	so there was no major mistakes,
sd	two, actually
sd	you know, around the windows, if you got it on the glass, we let it dry and scraped it after that
aa	Well, yeah,
sd	I didn't make that many mistakes,
qw	Why?
sd	Well, it wasn't,
sd	Well, a couple of week ends
nn	No,
sd	So, there's a whole bunch of people.
b	Yeah.
ng	not at all.
sv	I think, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine.
sv	I don't even think that it should be unanimous either.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
ng	Never.
sv	Well, you would think that they would get that in the,
aa	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've never , I've never even been called to jury duty.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I do , I don't think the judge should just make the decision alone.
sd	Least with the jury you have twelve people, you know that are going to decide, you know,
sd@	you're the person's fate. / * This really is part of utt1
aa	Exac ,
aa	Right,
am	Probably,
sv	or they fool the defense in thinking that they're, you know,
aa	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
sv	I guess it's just that maybe people are, you know, upset at court, you know.
sv	But, I think if everyone took it seriously
sv@	and, I mean, something you have to do . / * This really seems to be just a continuation of B.68, not an indep slash unit
b	Yeah.
sd	I would love to be called,
fc	It was nice talking to you.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	I almost never watch T V news.
sd	I get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio.
sd	it's a local radio station.
nn	No.
sd	Well, this station has a lot of just ongoing news
ny	Yeah,
sd	I read it pretty much from cover to cover.
sd	The TIMES HERALD went out of business here
sd	and so we really only have one Dallas newspaper and one, Fort Worth newspaper.
sd	financial trouble.
br^m	when did it happen?
sd	I guess they closed down about three months ago.
qw	So, how do you keep up?
aa	Yes, they're very voluminous.
qy^d	So there really is only one major L A now?
b	Yeah.
sd	I used to read TIME magazine a lot,
sd	And then we have a local rag here in town that I pick up periodically and read just to see what's going on in our little community. Because we don't get an awful lot of coverage in the DALLAS MORNING NEWS.
sd	Now, they have started here running a three day, or three times a week Plano section.
sd	And it's just sort of you know, four or five pages that covers what's going on in Plano.
sd	I would imagine you know, in, in Dallas they have plenty happening in Dallas to cover, that it gets hard covering all of the suburbs
b	Yeah.
qy	Well, did you go to college?
qw	And where did you go?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I went to the University of Minnesota.
aa	I am,
sd	Well, I'm in Texas.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I love it.
aa	That's correct.
na	She has her heart set on U T.
sd	So she went for a week,
sd	The reason I ask if you went to college is I thought, well, you know,
ba	wow.
aa	definitely.
b	Uh huh.
ba	how exciting.
b	Uh huh.
bf	that was, That worked out very well for you.
sv	Well, then he should come to U T.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Large classes.
sd	I went from a large high school to a large university
sd	I mean, it is a different feeling.
b	Yes.
qw	what does,
sd	she has, you know, interests that are just, you know, going in all directions.
sd	what she talks about a lot is theater which I think is ,
sd(^q)	I mean, I'm kind of really putting the practical application, you know, and saying, yet, do something that you enjoy.
^q	By all means, go get that piece of paper, you know.
bk	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I have through, the phone company,
sd	no nine hundred numbers can be dialed from my phone or received.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
sd	But it does not stop you from the, dialing services.
sd	Where they, intend to sell you things.
aa	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	Well, that's the thing I hated too about, Radio Shack.
sd	If you go in and buy anything they want your phone number.
na	Sure.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	Well, anything that you buy you may get put on a, preferred list that is purchased.
sd	and companies can purchase this list
aa	Uh huh.
nn	no.
b	Uh huh.
sv	that's the telephone is not the only invasion of privacy.
sd^t	I start.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yes .
bf	you moved from Dallas to San Francisco.
sv	That is a hugh difference.
sv	But you have good sour dough
b	Yeah.
b@	Uh huh. / * See B.22 note
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, that's a system too.
sd	Well then again, you know, you said you are able to take trips.
sv	So, I mean that's a form of budgeting I would think .
b	Yeah.
sd	well we have one on the way.
sd	my wife,
ar	No
qo	How about yourself?
qy	Do they budget at all?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Right,
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's great.
b	Uh huh.
nn	no, actually.
qy	Why, have you?
bk	okay .
aa	Yeah.
ar	No,
aa	Right.
sd	well, it's in the Caribbean
sd	And I was down there with a program from the college that I went to where we would just spend like three months in a foreign country, most of them third world countries. And study the language and then do a little service project.
b	So, yeah,
sd	well, see, I went there when I was in high school, actually
sd	and I mostly went to Germany and visited some friends of my family and, hung out with them, worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp.
sd	well, not that much .
na	Right,
b	Right,
qw	And, how long do you plan to be going for?
b	Uh huh.
br	A what?
ba	great.
qw	And, what else are you planning to do, if anything?
b	Uh huh.
nn	actually, no,
aa	Yeah,
nn	no,
qy	Have you?
bk	Okay .
qw	Where have you gone first?
b	Yeah,
nn	No.
sd	But from talking to people in other districts there are some major problems, with dropouts.
sd	and sometimes they didn't even show up for class
sd	And, they just didn't come to school.
sd	And I cannot imagine being able to do much of anything when they don't even come to school.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I think so too.
sv	The home is the key.
sv	I think really is because if the home, does not place a high priority on education
b	Right.
^2	Your education.
aa	That's right.
sv	they don't know what to expect at home.
sd	For example that child that was shot.
qh	how can they concentrate on schooling?
sv	I think that's the main problem.
sd	And school's now are supposed to solve social problems, mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try to provide them with some security.
sv	And that's overwhelming.
aa	No.
aa	True.
sd	We have always, though, had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids
sd	So they started, dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees through you know, through all three years of middle school.
sv	And I think that would give them more security in going to the counselor.
sv	If they have a rapport with their counselor.
sd	And occasionally that happens.
sv	But, it is frightening
qh	and, if we have children who are not getting their education, for one reason or another, then what are we going to do with them?
qh	What's going to happen to them?
sd	And our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them.
sv	That's no good.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well I think, one thing that we'll see is that we won't be educating everybody.
sv	There will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world where they don't try to educate everyone.
sd	That's one of the things that we do.
sd	We're the only country in the world that does.
sd	And let everyone have an opportunity to reach higher education if they're willing, you know, to work and have, some ability.
sd	They can do that.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well you know if we can keep them in school.
b	Uh huh
sv	then that helps a lot.
sd	It's scary to me.
aa	I, We are.
sv^t	I would imagine that we've talked the amount of time necessary.
b	Okay.
fc	Alright.
b	Oh.
ba	how exciting.
na^m	that is wonderful.
ba	What an experience.
bk	okay,
aa	All right.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I'm at grad school now in acoustics
sd^r	Acoustics.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
aa	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah .
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah ,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
bf	in the elementary schools.
b	Yeah,
bf	But I gather you do not separate, the bottles and cans.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
ny	Yes,
b	Ah,
b	Yes,
sd	And the thing that just was in the local news bulletin was, somebody ter , made some special, polymers that have the ability to, make certain actinide elements adhere to them.
sv	I think that's a wonderful idea.
sv	and it would also cause people to compact their garbage more.
sv	and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight.
b	Yeah.
bh	Is that right?
b	Uh huh .
o	But, no,
sd	but I basically never charge anything I don't have the money in the bank to pay for.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
bf	Surprising.
sd	the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really, you know, not so much discipline,
sd	I'm, thirty three.
ar	Thirty two,
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	You know, that just irritates me so much that I refuse to pay them interest
sd	but, you know, she could pay it off,
sd	and I just, you know, I just refuse to give it to them.
^2	Income.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
sd	And I'm not going to pay an annual fee.
sd	Well, lately, since I have children I've cut down on having dinner parties .
sd	but when I do I try to keep it pretty simple on things that I can prepare ahead of time ,
sd	it's really good
sd	That's one of my favorite things to serve.
aa	Sure.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qw	Well, how do, make, how do you cook crawfish?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	whe , when you serve it do you shell them and then serve em too?
b	Um hum.
b	Sure.
o	Still have see that. * slash error Ooh . / * slash error should be 'ba'
b	Um hum
qy	Does it taste a lot like shrimp
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah
sd	And before I had my second child we sort of had a contest going where  you know he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and I'd try to outdo him and then he'd try to outdo me
sd	was really a lot of fun
b	Yeah
sd	it was a lot of fun you know
sd	It was a lot of fun
aa	That's right
sd^r	it was fun
aa	It does
sd	make hot dogs or some potato chips
b	Uh huh
ba	that's nice
sv	it can be fun if you have the time
b	Uh huh
aa	Yeah
sd	it's real easy
sd	so salt and pepper and chopped up water chestnuts which is something different
sd	makes them a little bit crunchy
sd^r	But it makes them crunchy
sd	So it's not a thick rich type of a sauce
sd	And it gives it a bit of a different consistency
ad	The meatballs after you form them fry them in a pan until they're browned on all sides
ad	and then drain off all the grease
ad	probably you have to heat it up for a good
b	Right.
^2	And then freeze them
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Oh
sv^t	Well I think we've covered the subject
cc	I will
o	You know what,
bh	Is that right?
b	Uh huh.
qy@	Wow, don't they have the best record now? / * Shouldn't the "Wow" be an independent slash unit?
b	Yeah.

sd	Well, actually, the, the Dallas area here, pulls for Dallas.
sd	I mean, not a whole lot. You know,
sd	you know, I guess it's kind of like, there in the Bay area, you know, you don't find a whole lot of Sacramento fans.
ng	Really isn't,
sd	you know, it's, it's about the same distance from here to San Antonio as it is from there to Sacramento.
sd	So yeah, it's not really a local, you know,
sd	he does a lot of local stuff there in San Antonio
b	Yeah .
b	Yeah.
sv	Once he left, you know, it's just not the same, it's not the same team.
b	yeah.
qw	Who won that Portland game?
qy	Have you ever been drug tested?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I had one at T I and then one at another engineering company.
sd	But that would probably bother me to wake up one day and find out halfway through the day that you're going to be drug tested and you didn't know about it.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	That's true.
b	Right.
aa	That's true.
sv	I think they should be randomly drug tested.
sv	I believe, full force in that.
sv	I don't know that I believe every secretary in every company needs to be.
sv	You know, secretaries aren't really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something.
sd^r	So, I guess that's kind of biased.
aa	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
aa	That's true.
aa	That's true.
aa	Yeah.
sd	They would pay for an alcohol
sd	but they don't always pay for drug rehabilitation.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah .
sd	it's a urine test.
sd	it was really very official.
sd	So that they're sure that you haven't borrowed anybody's, I guess, or something.
aa	Yeah.
sv	but I guess it does .
aa	I know.
sv	It is amazing.
aa	Yeah.
bh	really?
ba	How weird.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's wild.
aa	Yeah.
sd	I can't even do it for Wadley, even though it's a good cause .
fc	Well, I enjoyed talking to you.
ft	Thank you.
fc	Bye bye.
qy	Did it work? .
aa	No,
ny	Yeah,
sd	I got him,
sd	and he, he must be cross part with some kind of desert animal, because he's very long and lanky,
nn	No,
aa	yeah,
b	yeah.
sd	I've seen them.
aa	yeah,
sd	so they're very nautical, too .
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
ba	I know what you mean.
b	Okay.
sd	We're from San Antonio
sd	it gets to about high seventies
sd	And Monterey it's, right on the coast.
sd	And it's, really nice.
sd	And, we usually get a fog. right I guess, about four o'clock
sd	and it gets very hot and dry
sd	But along here it's, , very different from the Texas type weather.
b	really,
b	Uh huh.
ba	well, that's good.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I miss that .
sd	well that's real nice because I can remember two years ago that in about February the hundred degree weather started in San Antonio and just continued.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	Y'all weren't getting any of the strings of the tornadoes and stuff were you?
b	Uh huh.
ba	gosh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm getting acclimated to have the cool evenings
b	Uh huh.
qy	Is that what Dallas is,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	I didn't realize that Dallas had that same problem.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and they had a pretty good early Spring
sd	so they're still talking water rationing this Summer,
sd	And the water in Medina Lake and that area was really going down, that they were considering that they might have to do water rationing
sd	So I said, well, this is pretty much like Texas.
sd	But, it's a really nice area.
sd	and used to essentially,
sd	And, to come here, it's kind of the temperate weather all year round.
sd	So it seems like we only have two Springs or two seasons
sd	We never really get any of the other ones.
sd	But it's a really nice, change of pace.
b	Yeah.
sd	we do a lot of, you know,
sd	and you don't have to worry about the high humidity.
qy	Does Dallas get high humidity?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and it just seemed like every year it just got more and more humid . And here well it's right by the ocean,
sd	but, it's not the same as Corpus.
sd	But here, well the water is extremely cold, up here,
sd	for some reason, because of the cold, ocean, water, the air is always cool.
sd	It's just completely different
aa	Uh huh.
sd	So it's been good.
ba	I imagine.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And, I've just never really been in that region of the country
sd	So, the people I know that are from there, they always miss it
ba	gee whiz.
b	Yeah.
fc	Yeah.
fc	Okay.
fc	Bye.
sd	I don't know,
bf	No.
sd	Well, I don't believe in drugs or alcohol,
sd	and we were laughing that we'd have to go to that examination to prove we could read and write with a specimen of urine
sd	and we found it belittling.
ny	Yeah,
aa	That's true.
sd	it's supposed to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs and alcohol,
sv	You know, in those areas I really, you know, do believe that maybe we should clean up our, you know house.
b	Yeah,
sd	But at the same token, in education we can't do random drug testing on kids
sd	you know, I mean, their rights are protected.
qh	well, but if you're going to do teachers or professionals, why not do the kids, when we see them and they're, you know, under the influence.
aa	That's true.
sd^t	It's three minutes,
aa	Yeah.
nn	No.
qy	Well do we agree, or unless it's not me .
o	You know, here we go again, I mean
b	yeah, you know
sv	I believe that truck drivers and people that have,
sd	and there was an incident in my children's high school, where a teacher stayed drunk,
ny	Uh huh.
ar	well, no,
b	Yeah,
sd	It was on the news tonight.
b	Yeah.
sd	because it does, you know,
ny	Yeah,
ny	Uh huh.
sd	And, you know, my children brought it to my attention.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And that's not giving a good example to students.
fp	Hi Nola,

qw	what's that mean? .

b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sv	well that, I mean that's very, young for a baby.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah .
^2	rather than she needs the money just she wants the stimulating environment .
b	Yeah.
b^m	Home school.
qr	is, is it like, a preschool level then or through grade school or,
sv	well you sound busy .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
bf	When they're young,
b	Yeah.
sd^t	The topic is to discuss the, sources where I receive news.
sd	And, for me that's mostly newspaper and radio,
b	Yeah.
b^m	C B S.
qy	Were they?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sd	But, I'm from California
sd	but they get all blown up in the news.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qy	Don't you?
qw	How come?
sv	Gosh that sounds pretty bad to me.
bk	I see.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	from Los Angeles,
sd	But, I grew up in L A
nn	No,
sd	So, I'm in the computer business.
na^m^t	This is my first call. Because I just got my password.
h	So I don't know,
bk	I see.
b	Uh huh.
fc	All right,
sd	about the only memories that I have of boating,
sd	But, I found the motor boating was real fun.
b	Oh .
sv	That sounds like a real challenge.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, my son,
aa	Yes.
na	Right .
aa	Really,
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
b	Okay.
ny	Yes,
b	Yeah,
qy	Have you had yours now?
b	Yeah.
sd	that's why I asked you.
sd@	you know, it does go in cycles, / *'
sd	And I was so relieved because I've been making a real concerted effort, you know, recycling the aluminum and the newspapers and even got into plastic because Wal Mart collected it.
sd	my garage was just getting overwhelmed.
sd	And, of course, I didn't go weekly,
b	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b^m	ha,
sd	Thinking I was safe in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned.
sd	But, you know, but it's not that hard now that I've got this system under control.
b	Yeah.
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	And, I don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than,
qh	and, yet, what am I going to do when I have a couple double A batteries to toss out.
sd	And they don't take,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	if they've got these bins for all the other little items,
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
bf	Registering our garbage .
b	Yeah.
qh	Wouldn't it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year .
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, except I know it would just not be cost effective.
b	Yeah.
bh	it did?
ba	Gosh.
ba	my goodness.
na	It is sad.
sd	Or, our taxes do.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, since I'm kind of on the older side, you know, I, I just feel like, when I start talking about benefits, I'm concerned about medical benefits .
sd	You know, I work for, a bank, Western Financial.
sd	And, they don't let me know really about anything that's going on.
ba	my gosh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Exactly.
b	right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I know.
sv	And in thirty years it becomes pretty critical.
sd	And because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff. And all the nuclear and stuff which is what he was working on. He's getting cut back
b	Okay,
b	Uh huh.
ba	I'd think so.
b	Uh huh.
qr	Now was this a one parent or two parent family?
b^m	One parent.
qw	How much time did she spend with them?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
qw	And what are you studying?
bf	Well, sounds like your getting a lot of experience in communicating with children .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	what base of communications would you be most interested in getting in to?
b^m	Public relations,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes,
sd	I started out with college and then went to high school
sd	I taught physical education.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I found that, it was a perfect combination from the standpoint of having vacations off at the same time.
sd	and it worked out fine from that standpoint, plus the fact that, when I left,
sd	and he did get on the bus,
sd	well, I was in physical education then
sd	and I wouldn't have checked on him.
sd(^q)	I listened to more than one parent say I don't know what this child wants.
aa	Absolutely.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	And we need more of that,
sv	And that I think has contributed much to, the delinquency that works grant and the poor school results that we're having. that the students, parents have just not really taken enough interest in them from the very beginning
sv	it's too late then,
aa	Right.
sd	And, while parents very often will be involved with the school activities when the child's in the elementary school
aa	Yes,
aa	Right.
sd	and we tried to be a part of it but not overshadowing him or making him feel that we had to be there all the time.
sd	So, I feel that I learned a great deal from my students, with regard to what their biggest complaints were with parents.
sd	and I never ever said that because I knew that that was one thing that was really irritating to young people.
aa	Yes,
nn	No.
nn	No,
sd	He didn't even tell us. that he had three jobs
sd	The biggest problem, well, like in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools that, you know, you can throw money at it,
h	I don't know,
sv	well, the values, more or less at home and the T V, just a general,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd(^q)	I thought, well, you know, of course they're doing better, and not so much when I was growing up,
sd	And I wonder if, not so much that,
b	Yeah.
sd	people were sending,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sd	I mean, it's been a while since I been in high school.
b	Yeah.
qy^g	well, that's interesting, isn't it,
b	Right.
qw	What did you think about that idea?
bf	They've not really given it attention either,
b	Right.
sd	Well, I'm glad I'm not the one that's in charge of making those decisions.
sd	So I would hate to have that responsibility just personally
sv	It seems like one way or the other we're going to end up paying for it.
bf	Just change our p ,
aa	Right,
b	Right.
ny	yes I am to, both questions.
ny	yeah
sd	and we, enter those into a spread sheet
qo	So what do you do?
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow .
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
bf	All the checks,
aa	Right.
sd	before we started doing that kind of a thing, we were, spending, money for things that, you know,
sd	and it was easy to, let things get out of hand.
b	Yeah
bf	That's a lot of money,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	it's just to, get up the money in advance and put it in, so long as it wasn't you know, unreasonably high, but for things like food expenses or whatever. Just put it in , in an envelope or whatever
sd@	and that way it kind of forced us to, stick to that amount. * Should end with a slash. This is an independent clause, as is B's next turn. And then well , * should be start of a new slash unit see B.58 utt2 if the entertainment amount was gone for the month say, it's gone .
ng	we haven't.
sd	We are just at a point where we could start thinking about it
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bf	A student.
ny	Yeah,
fp	Hello.
fp	Not bad,
b^m	Fernando.
aa	Sure .
bh	Really?
fe	Phew .
nn	No,
ny	Yeah.
bh	Really?
b	Oh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd^t	one of my instructors, said that they were doing something like this
sd	a Masters in, information systems.
bh	Yeah?
ba	Hey.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
sd	well, I'm in Monterey, California right now .
br^m	Two hundred fifty?
bk	Okay.
sd	And it's only or a hour away you know, to a large city.
nn	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
sd	So, I don't lose any sleep over stuff like that.
nn	Probably not.
sd	And, you know, most of the Navy funds that I probably won't do it until I,
sd	probably be another twelve years.
sd	you know I like what I'm doing right now.
br	Excuse me?
qy	If they pay for a P H D?
nn	Nah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, you know, a lot of times it's not the money that keeps people in .
sv	they like what they're doing.
b	Uh huh .
aa	easily,
sd	I mean, like I say, if you're, you know, if you're at an upper level in the rank category, you know, you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I didn't realize that.
b	Uh huh.
^2	push paper around.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
sv	And a lot of times you figure, you know, with the support that they provide, you know,
^q	why didn't you try something more mainline.
aa	No.
bf	Illegal or something like that,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	So, in other words, that's the way they force people out .
sd(^q)	That's why they can say, you know, there's no layoff policy.
sd	But they don't really say that, you know,
sv	hey, that's kind of sad.
aa	No.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Leading Edge.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Most people do.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
ba	It's amazing.
sd	Well, you know, when you get right down to it, the more they can do for you, like I say, the more, the more memory they're going to require.
b	Yeah.
aa	yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	Like the deal?
qy^d	Like a hologram?
bf	With just graphics on a,
bk	Okay .
sd	more than likely, it's going to be a Chrysler.
na	Chrysler LeBaron,
ny	Yeah.
sd	It's a eighty eight.
sd	I've had one problem with it after the other.
sd	the paints peeling off of it,
sd	my electrical system shorted out like two or three times,
sv	those are nice cars.
sd	the gas mileage for one thing,
sd	I, I hate driving anyway,
b	Yeah.
sd	And I look,
ny	yeah,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, that's what I'm paying on mine now.
sd	But I got it when the eighty eights first came out,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, that's another big factor of mine.
sd	Because my Mustang is, is two door with bucket seats,
ny	Yes.
na	I try to, whenever I can.
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
ny	Yes.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Yes,
sd	and the parking brake failed.
sd	and that didn't do the trick
sd	and then I got there and tried to,
nd	Well, actually that wasn't even eventually the problem.
sd	And, eventually I brought it up to a place called Just Brakes
sd	and it turns out that there's a,
ny	yeah,
aa	Yeah,
na	That's right,
na	I do.
aap	Well, that is one problem,
sd	For sixteen bucks they'll not only will they change the oil in ten minutes, and do you know, as good a job as I can do, but they'll, lube, too .
b	Yeah.
aa	Yep,
na	I do,
sd	and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle.
sd	not every morning, it probably averages about two days a week
sd	and then with my wife I actually go to the gym and lift weights, which isn't, I understand, quite exercising,
qo	How about yourself.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	That's right.
aa	Right.
b	Right.
bk	I see.
b	Right,
sd	and so, it's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise.
sd	My job at Texas Instruments, I have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls, so, that, I don't get any exercise doing that
sd	and plus there's a build up of stress
sd	so I need to go out and take those walks after dinner,
sd	so that's kind of a motivator,
aa	Sure,
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	something as simple as a walk with my wife is very enjoyable.
sd	I do that at the end of the day,
sd	Going to the gym is actually something different than, like,
o	Year,
sd	so, running, I'm at that point which you probably get to after about six months of dedicated running where you don't feel your muscles any more
sd	and you don't think about the pain of it.
sd	and that's no fun.
b	Yeah,
sd	I don't, I'm not a huge person,
sd	so that pays also.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I love her, you know,
sd	I guess that's one thing,
b	Yeah.
aa	yeah,
sd	I'll tell you, the sit ups and push ups are excellent you know,
sd	you're, you're struggling against your own body weight
sd	you can have variety by putting your feet higher or lower, by putting your arms further apart or closer together, by doing them real quick or real slow
sd	and you can actually get a good wo ,
bh	is that right.
b	Right.
ba	That's funny.
b	Yeah.
arp	Well, you know, maybe not.
sv	When your life becomes sedentary is when you have to make yourself a plan,
sv	and what's real funny about plans is that there's a struggle when you add something to your life, when you add a plan to your life,
sv(^q)	and that's the hard decision, is, okay, if I'm going to run in the mornings, what do I trade it off for.
^q	If I'm going to walk at night, what do I trade it off for.
sv	or, you know, it, it's always trade offs,
sv	It's, I mean, not just exercise, but anything.
sd	And, I don't think you should worry about not having a program yet.
aa	Yep.
fc	Nice talking with you, Craig.
fc	You too.
fc	Bye.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	well I guess I'm probably a little more toward the other direction.
sd	Maybe a little longer.
aa	Yeah.
sd	you know, it's hard I guess, for me to justify what seems like, you know, basically a breach of the you know, freedom from, search and seizure, you know, on something that may or may not stand as a law, you know, fifty years from now or even twenty or ten,
sd	I mean, prohibition certainly didn't last.
sv	Well, but you got to look at prohibition though.
aa	yeah.
sv	And clearly if you're into coke and all you want to do is, you know, snort your brains out all day long, if it was legal, you could do it real cheap
aa	yeah,
aa	yeah,
sv	there's no way you're ever going to win that.
b	Yeah,
aa	Well, yeah.
sv	I don't think you can.
o	So, you know, yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	it, it's pretty bad here, too.
sd	We've had a lot of murders drug related and stuff. In Durham, which is right next to Raleigh.
ny	Yeah,
aa	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Chapel Hill is kind of a ritzy city or whatever.
sd	And over half of it has been drug related.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	They've done special stories on the news, local news here.
sd	We had a lot of bank robberies and lot of break ins and stuff.
aa	Well, yeah,
na	I would say so for the majority in our, in my little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home
sd	and we all know one another
sd	Most people are, retired
sd	so I really don't worry about anything.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I don't know that we really have a budget.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	I've got a money market account that I do a lot of saving in
sd	Every month I add two hundred and twenty dollars to it.
sd	And I guess that's a way of budgeting.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	you know, we've got two cars.
sd	So, you know, I get one paid for
sd	but you try to schedule those things so that, you're not paying for two at the same time I guess is what I am saying.
na	Well, I have thought about it,
sd	My wife uses hers just for pleasure
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Those things can really upset your budget when they come in.
b	Okay

aa	Yeah,
b	Uh uh.
b	Right.
sv	Well, but the but the news, news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event, which is something that's good also about C Span which I tune into every once in a while.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I do use them.
sd	I have a few favorites that I use more than others
sv	but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when you start using more than a few
sv	and, they all can build up.
sv	I think they're handy.
sd	and, I hate writing checks when you go shopping.
qy	Well, do you use credit cards?
b	Uh huh.
b^m	Grandmother
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's good.
ba	that's, That's wonderful.
sv	Well, the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what you're savings is bringing.
sv	It's really, I guess ridiculous to let them keep building.
sd	But I know some people can get, you know, carried away with them and let them get out of hand.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's good.
sd	and, I saw on T V, they had a program on, credit cards
sd	and then I went and looked to see what my visa was
nn	No,
qy	Is that the one from Sears?
bk	Okay.
b	Okay .
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	they give you money back for using your credit card.
sd	I didn't know that.
sd	Well, you know, Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards.
sd	I worked at Sears for over ten years
sd	so, you know, now they'll take the Discover,
sd	But, I never did apply for a Discover card.
sd	I just figure with the Visa and American Express, I probably have an,
sd	I can do enough damage with those two.
b	Uh huh.
sd	But, I do like my Dillard's,
sd	And I do use Dillard's probably more than any of the other department stores.
nn	No,
b	Okay
fc	Good talking to you Beth.
fc	Good luck.
fc	You, too.
fc	Bye.
nn	No,
bh	really?
ny	Yeah,
sd	Well, I heard, that's the second happiest day of your life , .
sd	The day you sell your boat.
b^m	No,
sd	First best day is the day you get and the day you get rid of it
sd	I just don't know if I'd have the time to use it.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
qy	Did you go fishing?
bk	okay.
ba	wow.
bh	Really?
b	Yeah,
ny	yeah,

bk	Okay.
bh	Really?
qy	What do you take, I Thirty five?
b^m	Thirty.
bk	okay.
bk	All right.
sd	Colorado Springs.
ny	Yeah.
sd	we love it up there .
sd	That's where I grew up .
sd	But, we like it down here pretty good.
aa	Yeah,
sd	and it's kind of tough when my folks call and they want to see them .
ny	Yeah.
bh	really?
aa	Yeah,
ng	I don't,
sd	a friend of mine's dad was a program manager up there
sd	and he just moved down here to Mc ,
b	Okay.
sd	Well, actually, I went, canoeing down the Brazos this weekend.
sd	It was fun,
sd	Well, I guess Cadillac.
sd	I guess it's a General Motors product,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I think I'd still go with the Cadillac.
sd	I don't care about a big fancy .
sd	I don't know.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, I think the ones now with all of the, fancy gold lettering and all, you know, I think they're very pretty.
sv	And course the vin , what is it, a vinyl top, I think those are pretty.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sv^r	they look like they're very sturdy,
sd	I didn't know that.
b	Yeah,
b^m	The air bags,
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sd	Help our economy
sd	Mostly Oldsmobiles.
aa	yeah.
nn	no,
b	Uh huh,
sd	Well I don't know.
aa	Uh huh.
sd	But it's a very good car.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
aa	No.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No,
sd	but I, I would go with the General Motors any time.
bh	really.
aa	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yes,
sd	Well they range from, let's see about a year and a half to nine years old.
b	Yes.
bk	okay,
b	Oh.
ba	no.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes,
b	Yes,
ba	no,
sd	my boss thinks I'm absolutely crazy.
sd	and then when we go to sleep at night, you know, it's like my husband and I have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us.
sd(^q)	It's like all right, whose corners is this one.
b	uh huh.
b	uh huh.
ba	no.
aa	Yes,
aa	Right,
b	yeah,
sd	We started out with two outdoor cats
sd	well he lived through it,
sd	the cat almost died,
sd(^q)	And he's like thank you so much.
aa	I know,
sd	well, from what we can tell it was a pellet gun
aa	yes,
sd	I mean he started off as a stray
sd	But he's been a wonderful cat.
aa	yes.
sd	there's this, they just fill this void.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
aa	no.
aa	Right
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right,
sd	And, well I fell in love with this, it's a Chinchilla Persian, and, brought him home,
sd	and my husband just died.
sd(^q)	It was like we can't take it back
b	Uh huh,
b	uh huh.
b	Right.
b	uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Right,
ba	no.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	uh huh.
ba	that's good.
b	yes,
sd	it just drives us nuts.
b	yeah.
aa	They really are.
sv	but they're so much fun to watch them play.
b	Yes.
sd	we've got,
sd	And, they, will get to playing chase through the house,
sd	and it is hysterical, I mean
sd	I mean it sounds like a train.
aa	no,
sd	we have, Bonzo, Bear, Poindexter, and Felix.
qw	And what do you have.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh,
b^m	Nothing.
ba	Not a thing, goodness gracious.
sd	We have, tortoise which is a black and orange.
sd	And she's so ugly.
ny	Yes,
sd	I mean it's like nobody messes with her mamma.
sd	And, I mean, it comes bedtime
ny	Yeah,
b	And so yeah,
sd	It will be.
ba	goodness.
sd	My mother has dogs
sv	This is nothing like cats.
aa	Right,
sd	that's one of the requirements I asked him.
ny	Yes,
b	yeah,
aa	Right,
^q	I'm sorry,
sd	The whole family was so disappointed .
b	Right.
aa	Right,
fc	Well it was nice talking to you too,
fc	Bye,
nn	no.
h	I don't know.
sd	Because you know, like, there was an incident several years ago where an Amtrak engineer you know
sd	he crashed and killed some people because he was, smoking some marijuana
qy^d	So it's the government that's mandating it to a certain extent? .
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
bf	Kind of a coarse kind of test.
qy	Is that done,
bk	Okay,
sv	I don't think so.
b	Uh huh.
sv	that's bad .
aa	No.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yes.
aa	That's right.
sv	They're only going to suffer.
sv^r	they're only going to suffer.
aa	I know.
bf	Against forty other people being,
b^m	Those deaths.
qr	Or just an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what.
^2	or beaten.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Oh .
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
bk	I see .
na	Right.
aa	Right,
sd	I'm not sure I want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision.
sd	I don't know how old you are,
sd	And I could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever.
sd	And I guess I see that as not so much a demand but a privilege.
sv	since we live here and we all benefit, rich, poor or in between, there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest. I just see that as maybe a good idea.
sd	and I find ways to turn some of that back to others.
sd	I could see a full, a run , a gamut of different kinds of opportunities.
sd	I can't, imagine what kind of, bureaucracies we'd get into and expense having it be full time,
sv	it was needed,
sd	everybody has to put in so many hours of, public service in a given time, perhaps.
sd	I guess I see all of us benefiting,
sv	Something that they turn, back.
aa	That's right.
sd	And I see it being most beneficial if it's in or, or at least the area where the person lives.
sv	It might not be the same neighborhood, but the same city or county, because then you're coming in contact with it.
 sv	it almost needs to be something that has more impact for the individual, on going.
sd	But as far as putting that into work, I don't want to deal with the heartache of, first of all, getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics, of it.
b	Yeah.
sd	I, see a lot of things like, scouting, Boys Clubs, Girls Clubs, things like that, that kind of get into that citizenship, the looking after the environment sort of thing
sd	And I guess, I don't see, this being that different. But even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in, and would take a turn in.
qy	Do you have kids?
ba	well good.
sd	I know you've got to get past that grudge attitude that many have,
sv@	The adults, ahead of it would probably never serve and to each succeeding generation. There definitely would have to be a major P R campaign in each community, each county, * This is clearly 2 slash units. Why wasn't it parsed that way? parish or however the state was divided up.
h	well I don't know,
h	I don't know,
^2	and there were those that said, No,
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
h	And I don't know about your part of the country,
sd	and I work for Texas Instruments.
sd(^q)	And they've started some recycling campaigns that a year before that had been turned down because they said, Well, it's not feasible,
^q	it's not a good idea.
sd	It's just, a part of everyone's consciousness.
sv	I'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way.
sd	But, it is comforting to me to see, more concern about some of these things that cost us money.
aa	that's right, because,
ar	no,
sd	And as soon as the oil prices came back down, the pendulum swang the other way.
sv	And we need those reminders.
sv(^q)	or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say, my goodness, now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology.
ba	Ah!
sd	just about anybody you could name, whether I voted for them or not, makes, decisions that I just can't go along with.
sd	But that's why they're there and not me.
sd	I do too .
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I like doing things like making lasagna just because I can have it ready and baking in the oven,
sd	everybody just says how wonderful it is,
sd	That's one of those things I got famous for in college.
sd(^q)	It's like, well, I can't really give you a recipe,
^q	I can I can just do it .
sd	And it's fun,
sd	We just had a bunch of people over
aa	I do too, in fact .
b	Oh.
sd	actually one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays, just because it's real easy, is just baked potato dinners.
sd	And have, you know, like three or four couples come over,
sd	and it turns out great, because I mean, you've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and, you know, bacon and all that good stuff.
sd	But it's inexpensive
sd	plus it's real easy on the hostess, because you can just have the potatoes ready, and just have a salad with it,
sd^r	it's real easy,
sd	I'm in favor of very little clean up, very little planning because we've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games,
sd	we invariably end up at my house since I've got two kids.
sd(^q)	And it's, it's fine, because then I can just say, Okay fine,
sd	And it's pretty cool.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd	I love it .
qy	Over the uncooked rice?
b	Oh.
ba	how neat.
sd	Now I've done it where you cook the ri , well, I guess you probably could do it same way, but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup, and put a little bit of white wine in it.
sd	And every once in a while, I'll slice white grapes
sd	And then just bake it,
b	Yeah .
sd	that was one of the first things I made for my husband, because I was like,
sd	I could actually find something I could cook real easy that would be sort of elegant kind of .
aa	yeah.
sd	But then, I hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice.
qy^d	So, just, like in a thirteen by nine pan.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	Now that would be good.
qw	How long do you have to bake it?
sd	I do microwave too, a lot .
qw	How long would it be how long would it be in the microwave?
bk	okay.
qrr	or do you go ahead and let it cook through?
sv	this is a beneficial call.
b	Yeah,
ad	put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want to do that, you know. What ever, however much effort you feel like putting into it.
sd	But it makes a great,
sd	because my daughter calls it her gravy
sd	Well, you know, it depends upon our weather here. You know,
sd	it's a, ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater, cardigan over it.
sd	Because I had some appointments at the office today, some interviews
sd	But when it rains a lot, which is has been doing here a lot lately, very often, you know, wear, pants and boots you know.
qw	So how do you dress?
aa	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
aa	That's right
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	And we wear them a lot with shirts and things.
sd(^q)	As I have a private high school that I run here when I'm interviewing a parent, of course I feel like I need to wear heels you know, and look like I'm a business person. You know, because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle, if you wear boots too often, you know.
sv	Of course, you probably wear coats a lot.
ba	my goodness
aa	Yes.
sd	But of course, here we wear a light weight jacket a lot you know, you know,
sd	and, that's very seldom
sd	It's really different.
bk	I see.
bf	so you don't wear heels anymore I'll bet.
b	Yeah,
qy	When you were teaching, did you ever have, a blue jean day or anything like that?
b	Yeah, well,
sv	It's all right for the students,
qw	Where did you live before?
bf	well, that's quite a change from California to Utah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	But, I've never thought about wearing your worst outfit on Monday, because really no one's paying attention.
sd	Like, in the warm weather it's always shorts and a t shirt or a button up or something like that
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well that's good that they're so casual.
sd	I mean, my brother works for T I
sd	And, you know, whenever he was going to school, he was expecting to having to wear, a tie or a dress shirt everyday.
sd	and he just loves it.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's what I've heard.
sd	But, I mean, they just moved into the new building,
sd	and so they were going to try to take their blue jean code with them and trying to get all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans.
sd	and he'll be over there until July first setting up some kind of computers for them.
sd	I mean for T I but over in Italy.
aa	yeah,
sd(^q)	But, he didn't carry any ties or anything because he just went over there with that attitude, well if I don't take it then they won't make me wear it .
sd	Because, he didn't, you know,
sv	But I think that's great about T I,
sv	I think that's great.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think that's,
sd	Well, you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college.
sd	See that's how I am
sd	me to,
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's great.
sd	that's something that I'd be very interested in learning.
sv	they're outrageous!
b	Uh huh.
sv^r	it is really outrageous
sd	and she always told me it was because I was still growing
aa	Yeah.
ba	no .
b	Uh huh.
sv	That's the best way to shop.
h	I don't know,
sd	I try to, always catch the sales.
sd^r	Always .
aa	Yeah,
sv	So that has a lot to do with it.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's great.
ba	Uh, oh.
ba	no.
b	Uh huh .
bf	The defect.
b	Uh huh.
sd	T J Max does that,
b	yeah
b	Okay.
sv	Well, I suspect that it is possible.
sv	But, other than that I think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
^q	And, you know, how good a name can I make for myself and so forth.
sv	The president of General Motors probably has the same,
sv	I , I think a little more honesty in the campaigns would be, more to the point.
sv	If you knew what you were getting when you voted,
ny	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh .
sv	It's hard to imagine.
aa	Yeah,
qy^d	So you're taking a government course?
qw	At what?
b	Oh.
bk	Okay.
sv	You can make laws against corruption .
^2^g	But that doesn't eliminate it, does it?
qy^g@	Well, they've got laws against cannibalism but that didn't stop that guy in, * seems that a new slash unit should start at the conjunction "but" Milwaukee, did it?
sv	Actually, I think other countries may have it worse,
sd	Usually involving the Prime Minister or people very close to him.
aa	Yeah,
fp	Hey Steve.
qy^d	the deposits only on like drink stuff.
bk	Okay.
b	Okay.
bk	okay.
qy	So, did they,
bk	Okay.
ba	That's very cool.
b	Yeah.
qy	Do they do it with news papers as well?
b	Uh huh.
sd	this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall bulbs.
sd	Well, that's the way this was.
sd	I don't think we've had a frost up here.
sd	but, I don't know if it's late.
sd	I enjoy it.
aa	Right.
sd	but, I enjoy most of it,
ar	Well, it is for me
sd	and, took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing,
b	Really.
bh	really?
b	yeah
b	yeah,
b	Yeah .
sd	he waits until it gets about seventeen below up here
b	yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	they have to be hardened to it
b	Uh huh.
b	Really,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I love,
sd	I go there on business,
sd	and my wife and I,
b	Yeah,
sd	Ohio's a very pretty state.
sd	and now all of a sudden it was being developed,
ad	Well, don't bother .
sv	Well, from a woman's point of view it was very, chauvinistic as far as women go.
qw	How was that?
sd	That is one I've been dying to see.
b	Uh huh,
qw	How long did that movie run?
qw	But, I mean, time wise, how long,
b	Uh huh.
sv	That always seems to happen when you rent them, you know .
b	Uh huh,
ba	Was it, good.
ba	great.
sd	well, I'm looking forward to seeing that one.
b	Okay,
ba^r	good deal.
b	Right.
aa	That's exactly right.
aa	Yeah,
ba	gosh.
sd	but, it's fun, it's a fun thing to do to get out and be entertained for once.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh,
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay,
qw	Harrison Ford and, how does the story line go?
bk	okay,
b	Uh huh,
ba	gosh,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
qy^d	You enjoyed that one, then.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
sv	I don't think too many of them are anymore.
aa	I know .
ba	no .
ba	gosh.
ba	God.
b	Right.
aa	That's for sure .
fc	Well, you, too, Jim.
ft^t	Thanks for punching in
fc	I hope you see a good movie soon.
fc	Okay.
fc	Bye bye.
b	Okay.
aa	Yeah,
b^m	Twenty seven,
sd	Well, I do, jazzercise which is an aerobic, program that,
qy	are you familiar with it?
sd	It's, you know, a national company
nn	No
nn	No,
sd	The minimum they want you to do is three times a week.
sd	Well, it's really a
nn	No,
sd	and most of my friends that are my age don't exercise
sd	and since I am not a tennis player, you know, I don't get that,
sd	so, there aren't many people, you know, that want to do that.
sd	Most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers. You know, with children between the ages,
sd^r	Young mothers.
qw	Well, what do you do?
ba	great.
qw	Well, now who do you play with?
b	Yeah.
sv	Well see, that's really good
sd	I mean, I don't have a problem with weight either,
sd(^q)	I mean, people are always saying to me, how do you stay thin
sd	but I also watch what I eat. You know,
sv	but you'll come,
sv	but as you get older you will.
sv	Well, it might not .
b	Yeah.
qy	But, do you ski?
bh	did it really?
sd	Cause I know that skiing in Utah is suppose to be great.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and they ski.
b	Yeah,
sd	But there is a place in Utah called a funny name.
sd	But it's like, Heavenly.
aa	Yeah,
qy^d	You've never heard of that?
sd	Well, maybe it isn't in Utah.
aa	yeah.
qy	And then, is it your quadriceps that are the worst?
qy^d	In your legs and,
b	Yeah.
sd	and it's strange that you can do, like I did aerobics, you know, all the time
bh	Is that right? .
sd	Well, I never thought about that,
sd	and I was thinking yeah, and I was thinking
sd	the only Birmingham I could think of was Alabama.
aa	Yeah,
qy^g	I was going to say, not fun kind, right?
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	You know, I read one about Bob Hope that I liked.
ny	Yeah,
^h	I was trying to think,
ny	Yeah,
sd	It was a lot of fun because they used these real names, you know.
aa	Yeah,
ny	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b^m	Our movie stars,
sd	I haven't had a chance to read a lot lately either.
sd	starts out when they're small and continues through generations
sd	and I like that.
ny	Yes,
na	she is wonderful.
sd	I stayed up one night, I think until two in the morning finishing one of hers because I could not put it down.
ar	Well, no,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	because they go from hardback to paperback
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Huh uh.
nn	No,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	have you, gotten into SCARLETT yet?
aa	Yeah,
sd	and then when it came out, all I heard was just, how bad it was, that I didn't even want to get it.
nn	Huh uh.
b	No.
sd	Well it wouldn't surprise me,
b	Right.
aa	Right,
b	Right.
b	Yeah
aa	Right,
sd	And they may have some different idea,
sv	I think the judges do have that better knowledge of it.
sv	I mean, we can't say it doesn't, because it does happen.
sv	and sometimes that's not real fair either, though
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	But, which doesn't make any sense to me either.
sv	and they're put on like, they were the ones that caused it or whatever,
sv	that's not right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qh	And to me, how can you make a decision if you don't have all of the evidence in front of, whether it pertains to the case or not,
bf	So the two lawyers are the ones that have all the information.
^g	Don't they?
bf	They only put part of it.
b	Yeah.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ba	Wow.
ba	That's great.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sv	you get so attached to them.

b	Yeah.
b	Okay,
sv	you can't help
b	Yeah,
sd	The vet called her, a golden mix ,
h	like who knows, you know.
sd	But she's that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color, you know.
sd	and her nose is that pink, you know,
sd	she doesn't have a brown nose,
sd	so. I named her Rosebud,
aa	Yeah,
sd	And she's so easy going and so sociable,
sd	You know, she loves everybody.
sd	and she just, you know, thinks it's great.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Getting in,
ba	no.
b	Really.
qy	Did puppy go to?
ba	that's good,
ba	Ugh,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	Well the German Shepherd that I had before,
sd	and, she did not want any part of swimming
sd	And she'd just lay there on that step and just, you know, cool off .
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
qy	Have you seen, CANINE. The movie,
ad	you've got to see it. Especially since you have a German,
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	but that was the only time she wanted to get wet
aa	Yeah,
sd	And it came on T V the other night
sd	It is great.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well we always wait until we can rent them, you know .
bh	really.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah,
aa	Right,
aa	Really,
aa	Yeah,
b	Okay.
aa	Okay,
sd	And her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty nine revolution.
sd	Although she, herself, had never really accepted Jesus or gone through any of the other, Christian, portions of the faith, repentance, baptisms, et cetera, et cetera. She had always felt a very strong, leaning in this direction.
sd	So , anyway, as she grew up towards maturity, her parents, well,
sd	Everybody was back to a commonality of one.
sd	they were starting to, accuse her of, of, crimes and atrocities before the revolution and had her write her own story over and over and over.
sd	Being a child, you know.
sd(^q)	And, the Lord just said no,
sd	And they knew that she wasn't going to come back,
sd	and, she was not persecuted or anything else like that.
aa	Yes,
sd	Well, it was within, ninety days.
ny	Yeah.
sd	But it wasn't,
b	Okay.
br^m	GREEN CARD?
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Just then.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really,
qy^d	It terms of handling, acceleration,
qo	What about Mustang G T s?
bf	so you're talking about ones in a lower end, price range.
b	Right.
b	Right,
bf	Autocrossing is,
bk	Okay.
bh	really?
aa	Yeah,
sd	I think I'd like to get, B M W if I go the German route, which I'm kind of leaning towards right now, or maybe I mean, a, a Acura Legend.
sd	a Lexus, S C three hundred maybe. Something on that order.
sd@	I haven't really determined if I like the Japanese or if I like them enough to purchase one. * Looks like a complete slash unit to me
sv	You know, because your B M W s, your German cars have good reputations, I think.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah,
sd	I mean as you're walking through that little tour in, Munich, it's kind of , they're trying to brainwash you, too .
bh	really?
b	Yeah
aa	No,
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	So it's pretty minimal.
sd	Lasts a long time.
b	yeah.
sv	But, But if you have a problem with a Mercedes, you take it into a shop, they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things .
sv	I think, well, something on the order of a three series, it's probably different.
sd	I'm not sure if I really want,
nn	No,
sd(^q)	one evening I decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought, well, something's happens on Mockingbird and then heard yells and screams
sd	And they had stopped a stolen car and caught one of the men in the hedge
sd	and then the other one was on the roof in the back.
nd	on my house .
sd	So I'm very much aware of, crime in the cities and the concern about it.
sd	It was.
qy	Is Plano beginning to experience the kinds of things that are more common in the metropolitan, you know, in the urban area?
ba	That's too bad.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, it's farther west of me.
sd	I live over near White Rock Lake.
sd	it was really frightening to, think that, it's not even safe to drive onto the tollway, or for those people in the tollbooth.
aa	Yeah,
ny	Uh huh.
aa	No.
ny	Yeah,
qy^g	it is convenient, isn't it?
^q	I didn't know what I was doing.
b	Uh huh.
qy	do you know where Oakland and Hatcher are?
nn	no
na^m	It is a pretty rough area.
sd	And, you know, you watch the people.
b	Uh huh.
aa	It surely is.
sd	Well, I'm careful.
aa	Yeah,
ba	no.
aa	Yes,
aa	Okay,
sd	I used to.
sd	and, then I watch,
sd	I have a seven year old and a ten year old.
sd	so we usually catch, FULL HOUSE,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	now that is a good one.
sv	That is.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
ba	God.
qy	So, do you watch much T V,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Now, I never see that.
ba	nice.
b^m	Wednesday at seven thirty,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
qy	Are there any new ones this year that came out that you like
b	Uh huh,
sd	I'll have to watch for that.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh .
b	Yeah,
sd	 Well, we used to watch a lot of DESIGNING WOMEN,
sd	she was just funny.
sd	She was really funny.
ny	Yeah,
sv	that was awful
b	Yeah,
aa	I know.
aa	no,
aa	I know it.
sd	Well, I don't see how he couldn't be, you know.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
fe	shoot,
sd	Because I don't either.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Well, I am a student
sd	I want to see the FISHER KING and, catch ROBIN HOOD.
^h	let's see.
ny	Yes.
b	Yes.
sd	Enjoyed that quite a bit.
sd	the story was,
sd	it was believable.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	they knew the extras or the,
b	Uh huh.
^2	Scope.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it was,
sd	and it's just, shoot the Indians,
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
na	definitely.
ny	Yes.
sd	I actually went to the STAR TREK twenty fifth anniversary marathon that happened about a month ago,
sd	they had it everywhere,
aa	Right,
sv	but you can watch the characters develop,
sv	Well, the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so.
sv	I think a lot of it has to do with women working.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
aa	Right,
sv	and it seems, if you're going to have kids, that you know, society has decided for you how many you can really have and make it.
sv	because if you have, you know, two, well, if you go to work, you're, just working to pay for day care, two or three, you know,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	yeah,
sv(^q)	And I think society for such a long time said, well, you know, you're married, now you need to have, have your family
b	Right.
ba	Oh!
b	Yea ,
b	Yeah.
aa	yeah,
aa	I know,
ba	Gee .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv(^q)	But that's probably because, you know, if you had three, you, you know, would say, if I'd of had four.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	you know, I think I'm just part of the new stuff, that is just,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
^2	that's what you did.
b	Yeah .
sd	I, I like the way it is.
sd	see, we're from Houston and so it's not so hard for people,
sd	It's real small town,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd(^q)	They're probably going, I bet she can't get pregnant
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd(^q)	you know, she finally told me it's okay if you don't,
sd	And, she stayed home and raised her kids
sd	And, I guess I just
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah.
sv	Well, first I think they've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to do.
sv	once they have that, then they can start looking in all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves, and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer.
aa	Yeah,
sd	you know, if they want to get a liberal arts degree, I don't know what advice I'd give them.
sd	That's what I did .
sd	I didn't care about the program or anything else.
sd	political science.
qw	Where are you at?
b	Well, yeah,
aa	Yeah,
b	Sure.
aa	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	originally I had planned, undergrad degree in political science and then a master's in public administration.
sd	And after a year and a half of that I decided I didn't want that either .
sd	Haven't figured out what I want to be when I grow up.
sd	but I, I really did enjoy the law.
sd	And I've since discovered that I would be far better off being in the paralegal field. Because that's the nuts and bolts of the law, and that's what I like,
sd	and you don't have to put up with all the B S that the lawyers have to.
sd	So that's what I'm pursuing right now
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	good grief.
sd(^q)	I said, I couldn't do this everyday.
sd	I am, I am just a disgruntled person all around .
aa	Yeah,
sv	you probably got everybody on you, because they were probably all going to law school.
sv	Well, that remark in itself is a slam .
^q	You know, like, like, my best friends are blacks .
b^m	Jewish,
sd	and I, I, guess Iraqi now is the .
sd	law was a lot of fun until you get to law school
sd	and it doesn't become fun anymore.
b	Yeah,
aa	yeah.
aa	It is.
aa	Yeah,
sd	it was enjoyable for a while,
sd	and you begin to wonder, you know,
sv	If you have any doubts whatsoever, you better not get into it.
sd	I mean, I wasted a year and a half of awfully hard,
sd	But I, I wouldn't trade the experience for anything in the world.
qw	What branch were you in?
sd	I was too.
sd	Well, I got tired of the service after a while, I mean
sd	command post.
qy	I was just wondering, were you in SAC by any chance? .
sd	SAC.
bk	okay,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right,
aa	Uh huh,
aa	That's true,
aa	Yeah,
sd	it's just not for me.
sd	Well, I guess I would first identify myself as middle aged
sd	I, am quite positive on the things that I have seen happen recently relative to women both in society and in the work place,
sd	And I guess that's a significant change that I've both participated in and noticed.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Wonder about them in what way?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I guess one knows one's own storly
sd	so I guess my experience is just with what we did
sd	They were able to be home together.
sd	I don't know whether there will be an increased amount of surrogacy that we see.
sd	deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother.
sd	Sort of rent a mom,
 +	whether one might conceive, no pun intended, of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate, a professional mother, person. For instance, that,
sd	and you know, I could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting, story or whatever.
sd	I don't think I have a philosophical problem with that.
sd	I don't have other than a reading and male perspective on the ver , on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not.
sd	I don't have boys,
sv	Maybe we'll see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of, say, taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care.
sv	It would be a sort of day care,
sd	I know that there are young people, characterized, I guess as being half my age, so by definition that means, they're young. in my work place, who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying a woman, eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child,
sd	I could easily envision that.
sd	Or to put their child into a home setting, where you know, like they, they would leave at eight in the morning and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids
sd	and, and you were paying for really high quality care.
sd	I have acquaintances of mine where I know that they are paying figures on the order of what I quoted to someone, because that's the experience they want
b	Uh huh,
sd	I haven't ever really looked at them.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in American society?
sv	That's okay, too.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm noticing that, too,
sv	and that is a little troublesome. because the pressures on them are, rather formidable.
sd	and maybe that's a change we'll see.
fc	good bye.
fc	You take care.
fc	Bye.
sd	And me too, because I eat out a lot.
bf	So you eat all your meals out.
b	Sure.
qy	I was going to ask you, could you go to, you know, nice places,
qw	So what are the you know, memorable places you've eaten?
b^m	Houston's,
sd	It's a great place.
b	Uh huh.
bk	okay,
aa	I get it.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you like Mexican?
b	Oh.
sd	Well, I mean, there's so many places here, you know,
sd	But in the Addison, well about everything that you could want in Dallas is in the Addison area, anyway.
sd	I mean, now there's a new Italian place Sfuzi
sd	I've not been there, but it has a great reputation as one of the best restaurants in Dallas,
sd	it's S F U Z I.
sd	And it's in Addison,
sd	Now I really like Copelands.
bf	yeah, the, I know,
b	yeah,
bf	Magic Time Machine is the place you're thinking of,
sd	See, when I went, I thought,
sd	but then I just thought the food was over priced for what it was.
qy	Do you like Southwestern?
sd	Well, now there's a good place in Addison too called Blue Mesa Grill that's on Belt Line that's close to Houston's, as a matter of fact.
sd	And, it's great,
sd	So that's a very good place to eat, The Blue Mesa Grill.
^2	A whole new, dining experience.
sd(^q)^t	I thought sometimes they say, you know this is three minutes or whatever.
bk	okay.
b	Okay,
ft	Well, thanks for calling for helping us out.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	we have one rotten cat.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	Well, I like cats.
b	Yeah
sd	Just, stays away or runs usually.
sd	But he'll follow my oldest son around.
sd	he, we bought the cat for him
sd	So, it's a weird cat .
b^m	A mutt.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	So is that, is that kind of your child right now?
bf	You feel like. .
b	uh huh.
qy	have you had dogs before?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
nn	No.
na	I would.
sd	and, I should say a pup
sd	and when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get you know, was a pet
sd	the kids couldn't handle him
sd	so we gave him to,
sd	and they have,
sd	So we took him up there
sd	and so we asked him about it one day
sd	just goes everywhere with him.
sd	well my favorite, well,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sd	So, we used to go and listen to them all the time
sd	So, I grew up with a lot of his music, and what not.
ny	Yeah.
na	Sure did.
ny	Yeah.
sd	We all go back to parents' houses on the weekends, and what not
bh	really?
qy^g	It is a small world isn't it?
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
aa	uh huh.
sd	It was really nice so ,
sd	He's a little boy .
sd	I can't,
sd	I keep forgetting, what she named him.
sd	His middle name is Chris, or Christopher for for her daddy,
sd^r	but , I think it's Elijah .
sd	It starts with an E.
h	I can't remember .
ny	Yes.
b	Yeah,
sd	actually one of my favorite instruments is a harpsichord.
sd	I really like those,
ny	Yeah.
sd	Which was real nice.
sd	I liked the sound of the harpsichord.
nn	No,
nn	No,
sd^r	It was real nice.
b	Yeah.
sd	not, you know, the bouncy, you know sing along kind but some of the older ones that
sd	some, I don't even, I recognize the melodies, and whatnot,
sd^r	So, it was real nice.
b	Uh huh.
aa	It does.
sd	I don't know how else to explain.
sd	And my dad and
ny	Yeah,
sd	So he hasn't really gotten into, that yet.
sd	but, he's not old enough yet to get into the band yet.
sd	I think that starts in sixth grade.
h	but I don't know.
aa	Yeah,
bh	Really?
b	Yeah.
sd	I don't know if any of mine will be interested in it
ny	Yes.
sd^t	I think we're going to talk about parents spending time with their children.
sd^t	So this is the big issue with us. Although I don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about
h	Anyway.
qy^d	But you're married?
b	Oh.
sd	I'll be right back.
fp	Hello?
fa	I'm so sorry.
sd	That was my daughter's Brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow Brownie meeting.
sd^t	Well, I don't want this to be a unilateral conversation
sd	The kids, they are real people
sd	I'm sure that's coming though.
br^m	You had eight boys and one girl?
qy	Are you Mormons?
sd	That's what the Utah and the large family.
sd	Well, we're Catholics.
sd	the only girl.
sd	And everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled.
aa	No.
sv	Well, I do think with working parents I mean, there are some real issues here. that I think,
h	I don't know.
sd	My husband is a physician,
sd	And I feel when my children were very young, I had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing.
sd	I really believe that.
sd	so I know it sounds like a rationalization
sv	There's no question,
sd	I hate to put it quite that way.
sd	I was twenty nine when I had my first child
sd	it's wonderful to be a mother
sd	I sort of worked half time.
sd	and I think we choose very carefully the, alternative situations that we had them in.
sd	Some baby sitting groups,
sd	I think that helps.
qy	Well, so . So, your wife, does she work right now?
bf	She's out,
qy^d	You're still trying to dry out?
sv	Well, if you're from Iowa, you must be very artsy crafty.
sd	I didn't know anyone ever moved from California to Iowa?
sd	I'm teasing, only because I'm from Indiana.
sd	I like the Midwest.
sd	But I married a Texan,
bf	you do a lot then.
sd	actually I'm pretty untalented .
sd	I used to do a lot of knitting and crocheting,
sd	and in December everyone was doing stockings, you know these gorgeous, detailed minute, tiny stitch stockings.
aa	Yes.
qy	Is this your first baby?
qy	Have you crocheted or knitted any baby clothes or baby blankets?
qy	Did you embroidery the pattern and then quilt it yourself,
b	Uh huh.
qy	But you actually hand quilted it yourself?
qy	did you need a loom,
ny	Uh huh.
sd	But, again, my mother back in Indiana,
aa	yes,
bf	you think, children,
sv	I think when babies,
sv	Once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear them .
ny	yes,
sd	So I went and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back
sd	and it was salvageable ,
b	Okay.
ny	yes.
b	Uh huh.
b^m	Handicraft type things.
aa	Yeah,
ba	that's pretty good.
b	Yeah,
sd	It's kind of neat.
aa	yeah,
sd	And, we kind of help out the people who are really not .
nd	I think I'm, I think I'm a hacker,
nn	no,
ny	Yeah.
sd	Backpacking.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, just last weekend went to Davy Crockett forest which is kind of out in east Texas.
sd	And we go to, places out in,
aa	yeah.
b	Yeah,
nn	no,
nn	No,
aa	yeah,
nn	no,
ny	yeah,
sv	It's better than, you know, owning on them and making payments on them, and, you know, things like that.
ny	yeah,
sd	But, there's, some stuff that I want to do with like Sierra Club and go down to Grand Canyon or something like that.
sv	Which seems kind of reasonable because that means you don't have to take twenty thirteen year olds with you, which seems a, just a tad more relaxing .
b	Uh huh.
fp	Hi.
fp	Hi,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah .
sv	It's kind of an easy thing to talk about.
ny	Yeah,
b	Okay.
ny	Yes.
aa	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Because women are in every field now,
sd	And I know at least in the medical field, it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field.
sv	I don't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think that would be the best goal.
aa	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
aa	Exactly,
sv	your age or anything.
aa	Uh huh,
aa	Uh huh,
sd	Like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job, or,
bh	Is it.
sv	That would be great.
sd	Or, a lot of women I know now and one of my supervisors, when she went on L O A to have her baby, we hooked up, a terminal at her house
sd	I would just take her the actual paperwork once, every week or two,
sv	And that's a real attractive option, if you have the technology for it.
sd	All it was, you know,
bh	Do you?
qr	Do you work like half days, or half weeks or,
ba	that's great,
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's wonderful.
aa	Yeah,
^2	Either way,
aa	Uh huh,
b	Yeah,
sd	I do too, especially as women get up in management and can be in on those decision making,
sv	Plus, I bet it cuts down on your absenteeism because you've got two days off that you can do everything,
b	Uh huh,
sd	That's been real helpful too,
aa	Uh huh,
aa	no,
sd	I think there is still some discrimination there where you know, men and women work in the same job,
sv	but I think that's improving.
sv	and you just want to make it right,
aa	Yeah,
fc	Call again.
fc	Okay,
sd	Well, I have to say my favorite type of music would probably be, classical music.
bh	really.
qw	What type of music do you like in the classical area,
b	Uh huh.
qr	do you go to the operas that they sing English or go to the ones that they sing other languages?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
qw	What is that?
sd	I didn't know that.
sd	That can help people like me.
ba	Well, I can understand that.
aa	Yeah.
sd	Course I like, also string instruments,
sd	So, I get to go to at least four or five concerts a year .
sd	One is thirteen and one is eleven.
ny	Yes.
b	Yes .
aa	Yeah.
sd	So, I try to enjoy all of it.
na	a little bit,
sd	I do belong to a Musical Heritage Society.
qy	Do you belong to that?
na	You can get recordings.
sd	and, they do a lot of original recordings themselves.
sd	But they also, go to the different composers, or the different, I guess,
b	Yeah.
aa	Sure.
sd	Or they will kno , find out when they're performing,
b	Yeah.
bh	really.
bk	I see.
ba	Well, that's good.
ny	Yes,
ny	Yeah, I do.
sd	I've got a male Siamese about a year old here.
qo	How about you?
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, it's, you know they're just, aggressive by nature
sd	and, he's been neutered and declawed,
sd	so, that kind of calms him down for the most part.
qw^d	and you say you've had him how long?
b^m	Two years.
qy	Does he bite her enough to draw blood?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	You wouldn't want him to carry her off or something.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
qy	Is that the only pet that you have?
qy	Well, do you live, you in a house, or a place where you,
bk	I see.
b	Sure.
nn	No,
sd	you know, I saw something on C N N or on cable here a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments and in houses,
sd	and they apparently,
na	I guess.
aa	Yep,
bk	I see.
sv	and some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see in there.
ba	Goodness.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qr	Well do you all work for T I, or for,
ny	Yeah,
sd^t	This is the very first one I've talked to.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, , see I'm going to school right now,
sd	and I don't watch T V as much really either, because, my free time is kind of,
sd	While I'm at work sometimes, on the computer network I read the news sometimes,
sd	and that's kind of helpful.
aa	That's true,
sd	And the people I work with are pretty, you know, up to date on that kind of stuff,
b	Uh huh.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think the,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qw	What kind of, see,
sd	but other than that I don't really read,
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would probably take the whole news hour .
ny	yeah,
bh	really?
sv	That's going to be crazy that time of year here.
sd	I can't believe, I mean,
sd	and they did so well last year.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Right.
aa	Exactly,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sv	It's a sort of a piece of luck.
b	Yeah,
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see what you're saying.
sd	Well, I would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that, around,
aa	Alright .
na	Sometimes, not all the time .
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	five.
sd	well I'll be hitting that fairly soon because all of mine are boys, too.
sd	And they get pretty particular sometimes in what they want to have.
aa	yeah,
sd	And I told him he's going to have to get a part time job by the time he reaches teenage years so he can eat.
sd	My husband and I, our favorite meal is,
sd	and he does the steak
ny	Uh huh.
sd	And he marinates it in his special stuff that he does.
sd	And it's real good.
sd	And, I do sauteed mushrooms,
sd	and asparagus.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	It's not the one with all the shells and stuff in it, is it?
sd	I don't know what that,
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
ba	yeah.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I don't eat enchiladas.
sd	I don't like enchila , I don't like the tex ,
sd	But everyone else in my family does.
ny	Yeah.
h	I don't know,
sd	But, my kids love it.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	or I give it to my Mom and Dad if I know we're not going to eat,
sd	you can use chicken or turkey,
sd	And it's rice and, ,
sd	I do it to taste.
aa	Well yeah,
sd	and that's it, and some hard boiled eggs.
sd^r	And that's it.
sd	And you sprinkle, those, toasted onion rings. On top of it for the crunchy.
sd^r	And that's it, you know .
sd	and it's filling because of the rice.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	I know.
sd	I don't like tuna salad unless it's got lots of mayonnaise in it.
b	Yeah.
o	I know.
b	Yeah,
sd	And they don't need any added help.
sd	So, when we're here at home, you know, with sweets and stuff, they don't, we don't really do that much.
sd	and drink wise they have Kool Aid, milk or water. Normally.
sd	Now when they go to their grandmother's house, which is every weekend. It's a, it's a different a different story all around.
aa	Uh huh.
sd	That's exactly what it is.
bh	really?
nn	No,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
bf	The lower cholesterol foods and stuff .
b^m	my first comments on the budget.
nn	Surprisingly, no.
br	You mean the prisons?
sd	I hadn't heard that.
b	Right.
sd	But to me it,
sv	Well, see the other way I'm thinking about is they should be self supporting, like, the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons. Anything to where they can be self supporting within themselves.
sv	It's the same thing like the whole I shouldn't say criminal, but the whole police department of the United States.
sv	So it's you know, self defense on that point.
sd	But again I'd like to see something on the other end back into education. But not in the education we have today.
ar	Well, not so much pay.
b	Yeah.
qh	why not an apprentice out to a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or, you know, just a technician?
sv	our education budget will go down if this is,
sv	But that would come down.
sd	Excuse me. I see it being done .
ny	Yes.
ba	Wow!
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, that's something about what Germany's supposed to be doing. Something similar to that right now.
sv	they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around. Because they don't have any education.
sd	I don't mean college.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah.
sv(^q)@	Well, it seems to me that kids that get out of high school that parents have gone to college and college here and college there that are really not interested in going to college and forced into it, usually are your drop outs. Where if they're said, hey, it's just as advisable to go into something you enjoy and you like. / * Seems that new slash unit should begin with "Where . . ." even though what follows is a subordinate clause.
o	Question.
qy	Were you watching,
qo	So what do you think about, recycling programs in Atlanta, Julie?
no	I don't know,
sd	That's the only way I could really,
sd	Uh huh.
sd	During the summers, like around where I live the, homeless people see ,
sd	and they're go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff,
sd	and so we used to just save them up
sd	during the winter time I think they move south or something
sd	so, I don't do that anymore.
sd	They just overflow.
qh	So what's a guy to do? You know. * Shouldn't this end in a slash?
h	I asked myself.
bh	Really?
sv^r	Inconvenient, even .
qy^g	so, you do recycle, don't you?
b	Yeah,
sd	but I don't ever take anything.
b	Uh huh.
^h	But wait
sd	I've never seen you before .
b	Yeah,
fp	Hi.
sd	Me, too.
ba	Crazy.
qy	Do they do
bh	Really?
qw	What about like those grocery bags?
b	Uh huh.
sd	They'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic.
sv	Those petroleum products are going to kill us.
sv	The hostile planet, I think, Julie.
sv	I mean, those petroleum products I think are the big, you know the great Satan of the recycling.
sv	Paper just seems so innocuous.
sd	It comes from trees.
qy^d	They treat it with chemicals or something?
b	Yep.
bh	Really?
cc	I'm going to switch from those yellow legal pads, then.
sd	I'm glad you told me that, because I use those at work, where I work
qo	Well, what about, papyrus, you know, made out of you know, bamboo stuff, from the from the banks of the Nile.
bh	You think so?
qy	Tablets?
sv	I think we should just abandon you know, the written word altogether, you know.
qo	What do you think?
sv	Kind of radical, I know
aa	That's true.
fp	Hello.
fp	Hi,
nn	No.
nn	No,
na	We might as well.
qy^g^t	I understand we are doing care of the elderly, right?
qo	And how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home?
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes,
aa	Yes.
aa	Yes.
sv	but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference.
sd	And, I know that the cheerful pleasant people who treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels about, her situation.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And they may be ambulatory,
sd	and that would be very difficult I think for an adult who wasn't in that situation to to have to deal with on a daily basis.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes,
b	Yes
sd	well, you know, I guess it's pretty deep feelings,
sd	Got some insight there, to kind of help me put together the feelings.
sd	You know, what for him to finish me off .
nn	No,
b	Oh .
sd	Well, personally, you know, I just went in limbo.
sd	I mean, I just didn't know.
ny	yeah,
t3	Okay.
nn	No,
bf	Downside. well,
sv	So it's pretty serious, really, you know,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
bh	Isn't that something?
b	Uh huh.
fc	We'll see you.
fc	Yeah,
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well I think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not,
sv	And nothing is being done about it.
sv	Well, well it, it seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished,
sd	And where his, old evidence was there, the witnesses were there, everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet ,
fp	Hi, Nancy.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, we do some dining out.
sd	well actually there's the Atlantic Cafe and Cafe Pacific, and,
bh	Have you?
sd	It's Highland Park Village.
sd	I love it .
b	Uh huh.
sv	it's fabulous.
sd	Atlantic Cafe is down I believe it's on McKinney.
sd	and originally the two, the guy who owns the Cafe Pacific and the guy who owns the Atlantic Cafe, were partners in the Atlantic Cafe.
sd	It's wonderful.
sd	So you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in.
sd	I love it.
sd	And, my husband really likes their ribs.
sd^m	I know right away what we want.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Was it?
sd	but, I've never been there for dinner.
ba	that's great.
sd	Maxwell's nice,
sd	And I didn't think we ate out very often .
sd	And, one place I'd never been that I would really like to go to, is Lawry's.
sd	I've never been there
ny	Yes.
b	Yeah.
bh	Really?
b	Uh huh.
^2	The specials.
qy	Have you ever been to Biffin's?
sd(^q)	and they keep saying, you know, it's wonderful, it's wonderful.
sd^r	And, I've not been there.
sd	I've been there.
sd	I've heard of it.
qy^d	and it's filled with what, whip cream and strawberries and something?
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
ba	I bet it was.
sd	and, for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves .
sd	And, you know, they did, like the raspberry puree, just kind of like in a decoration on the,
sd	and it was outstanding.
sd	It was really relatively simple
^2	You can't find them.
sd(^q)	And, I thought I would really miss that.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Because the ones that aren't so good just don't make it.
bh	really?
qy	Do you have any children?
b	Oh .
aa	Yes,
b	Oh.
qy	Do they go to a day care center
ba	that's nice.
ba	that's nice.
sv	I think so.
sd	But this one that I'm in now is very good.
sd	And like in Pennsylvania for babies, that's what I work with, there has to be a one to four ratio at the most. No more than four babies per care giver.
sd	But we keep it down to like two to one.
aa	Yeah,
aa	I know.
sd	What we do is we have these cribs in the back room where they sleep that are, low to the ground
sd	and they're reenforced real strong
ar	No .
aa	Right.
b	Yeah,
sd	Most really care, in this center, really care.
sd	And really there's only like eight children per room
sd	And that enables them to spend more time with the children.
sd	It's easy to get attached to them too.
sd	in my room they go from eight weeks to nine months.
sd	And throughout the center it goes up to like age twelve.
sd	So, I have the real young ones in my room.
aa	Uh huh.
sd	you know, they're wonderful.
aa	Yes.
aa	Not quite.
sd	you have to be real careful everything is baby proof.
b	But, yeah,
sd	there is a lot of college educated people and stuff that are in the centers that really seem to have an idea of what's going on.
sd	And, in general though I've been really disappointed with a lot of other centers I've worked at, and all
sd	it's not my choice for when I have children
aa	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That is sad.
br	What?
ba	my God.
b	Oh.
ba	my God.
ba	that poor child.
ba	That's awful.
sd	Personally, I do not care for them. although I find them a necessity in business and so forth,
sd	The one I use, of course, mostly, only for business purposes is, you know, American Express.
sd	And, I'm not terribly in favor of them.
sd	Plus you know, from an economic point of view it has increased our debt tremendously to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion, I believe
sd	at least that's one number for this range of numbers I have heard.
qy	Do you use them frequently
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I find the one I use mostly,
sd	But, a , as with the American Express, I try to pay it, you know, as it comes in.
sd	I know or when I used to travel overseas quite a bit, what I would do on my American Express card is before I left I would mail a check to American Express and, you know, have some idea of how much was there, you know, I'd sent them, you know, several hundred dollars, or whatever I felt I would spend. } And then use it then.
sd	But, for hotels and so forth.
sd	you know, sometimes I would go over,
sd	Well, I found I found in traveling overseas that, often it would expedite things to have an American Express credit card for hotel bills and so forth.
sd	Plus when they, would send the bill, they would automatically convert to the exchange rate.
sd	So, now, the only time that got to be a problem was, if the exchange rate changed drastically.
sd	for example, I remember on one trip to France when I started planning the trip, I think, a dollar was worth nine or ten
sd	And when I finally got over there, it had fallen, two or three francs to the dollar.
sd	So, I got caught a little short in that regard,
sd	but, I was anticipating, you know, my room would cost, let's say
sd	if it were, say sixty or seventy francs a night that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so, or maybe twenty dolls ,
sd	maybe it would be more than that.
sd	But then when I got back and I was working for the government at the time
sd	of course the government was several months behind in, their, on its per diem for exchange rate.
sd	So there's a little consternation, you know, in trying to get them to compensate, for the difference in the exchange rate.
sd	That was the only time I really got caught short.
bf	So you're from Dal ,
ny	Yeah .
nn	No.
ny	Yes.
sd	Well, I know Jack Godfrey.
sd	I know him very well.
sd^t	So, when I heard that Jack was going to do this, I called him and asked for an application where I could participate in this.
sd^t	And, so that's how I got involved.
ft	Thank you very much .
ny	Yeah,
sd^t	And so, I was very much interested, in getting involved in, switchboard.
qy^d	So, you work for T I?
bh	really?
sd^t	I guess we're supposed to do this part of it before we started the recording .
aa	Alright.
fc	It's been pleasant talking to you.
fc	Take care.
sd	We have a nine year old.
na	when both of my kids were much younger.
b	Uh huh.
ba	wonderful.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
sv	that will be fun, too.
ny	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
nn	No,
b	Yes.
ar	Well, not really,
^2	How easy .
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	And then got to pick and choose the places.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right,
aa	That's true.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	there's too much to see really.
aa	Right.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
ny	Yeah,
sd	That was a little bit too much money.
br	I'm sorry?
sd	It's called, oh, what was it called . City Sports, downtown Washington.
aa	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	Do they feel that way?
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it.
h	I don't know,
sv	So I think it's a good idea
sd	I don't know that their job would be at risk,
sv	I would think that,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, , I guess I draw a hard line ,
sd	and you expect them to do their job
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right,
sv	and it would be, you know, out of the question.
sv	Also, I guess you can, you know, get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever, all kinds.
sd	I sub in the schools
sd	so I've, you know, had a,
sd	and I think it's good that they're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools.
sv	But, you know, I think they can test all they want for drugs you know,
sd	and I know many of them are doing it.
sd	and I don't know how many others are doing that
h	and, , I don't know,
bh	Really?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Just lucky to have jobs.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period
sd	and Sam's and Wal Mart are owned by the same people
sd	he took one for, Wal Mart for job hiring
sd	and then Sam's called him
sd	and you know, I don't know why they both made him do that since it was so close together.
sd	I can see if ,
sd	Well, maybe they run,
sd	I just can't imagine them screening all these employees, paying a thousand dollars to get them.
qr	So are you a freshwater or,
sd^r	Freshwater,
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, I have caught one or two small sharks
ny	and, yes.
sd	Put them back .
nn	No,
qh^m	Is there a limit?
sd	so, they do a lot of shark fishing you know, in the gulf
sd	and, there's a certain period of time during the year all along the gulf coast from, I guess from Galveston to Mayport they have, shark tournaments,
sd	I think I've been trout fishing once.
sd	I've tried it once,
ny	yes,
nn	no.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes .
nn	no,
sv	you know, there are people who fish,
sd	Well, I'm a fisher .
na	That's right,
sd	and occasionally we'd go out on a, you know, full day trip, you know, three or four other people and do either, again, bottom fishing or or for grouper
sd	or, you know, I've caught a few worthwhile snappers, red snappers and gray snappers and so forth.
qo	What about you a,
b	Uh huh.
aa	yes.
sd	The last time I went, bass fishing,
sd	my daughter caught fish,
sd	I did not even,
aa	That's right,
aa	Right,
sd	But, I enjoy it though.
sd	And they do, of course, you know,
sd	and they do a lot of fishing there.
sd	And, that I was able to do, when I could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom.
aa	That right .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I guess the weirdest thing I've ever caught is, in some of the inlets and the rivers around Delaware.
sd	They have a fish that's called an oyster cracker.
sd	and it has a huge strong mouth,
aa	Uh huh,
sd	I guess the largest one I ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long,
nn	No,
sd	they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, the first time I went surf fishing was in ,
sd	I had never seen anything,
sd	Well, I guess I'm a big L A Laker fan, when it comes to pros.
sd	the college ranks, I guess I really,
sv	But they don't have much of a team usually.
aa	Yeah,
sd	You never see them on nationally basketball.
sv	last year they had a really good team,
sd	That was about five, six years ago by now.
sd	and they usually lose in the first round.
qo	How about you?
b	Uh huh.
qy	Is it the Bulls you're talking about?
b	Yeah,
bh	Is that right?
b	Uh huh.
aa	No,
^2*	Every game?
b	Right,
b	Yeah.
sv	and, it was a good game.
sd	It was a very close game, and hard fought game.
sv	but, as far as playing together as a team that day, Duke seemed to have them off balance.
sv	And that, they couldn't,
b	Right.
sv	They shut all that down and made them play half court it seemed
b	Right.
aa	Right,
b	Right.
sv	I think that probably was the difference in that game.
sv	Because it really could have gone either way. Down to the end, you know.
no	I don't know.
sd	Since Kareem's retired, they haven't had a center.
sv	And, they've got Perkins,
sv	but I don't think he's really been a super star for them.
b	Yeah.
sv	They'll make it, you know,
sv^r	That's going to be a war.
sv	It's going to be a great series.
b	Yeah.
sv	One of those two will probably be, in there,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
sd	I mean, so does Chicago. So do , all three of them do, with Larry Bird back,
sv	you can never count the Celtics out when Larry Bird's, starting to click on all cylinders.
sd	They say he's starting to play,
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	Last I've heard is that he's starting to peak right now.
sd	He's, starting to be more consistent, you know, at the right time of the year.
sd	any dark horses I, you know,
sv	San Antonio, San Antonio is the dark horse that could really flip in there, I think.
b	Yeah.
sd	against any team he would dominate,
sd	I mean, it looks like he's going in for a dunk
sv	nobody's got enough beef, I guess, to challenge him when he's driving hard to the hoop.
sv	With Roy Tarpley they're in big trouble.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I heard he was suspended. Because of his,
sd	If they did, they'd still have to pay his contract .
sd	They may have done it.
sd	It was a lot of money.
sd	I heard on the radio it was sixty three thousand and change a month.
sv	boy, what a good job he had .
sv	He ruined his sweet position .
b	Yeah.
sd	L A,
b^m	Portland.
qw	What do they have
aa	Right.
sv	I don't think there's any clear pick, you know.
sv	I guess the two teams that you can't count out are the Celtics because of Bird, and the Lakers because of Magic Johnson.
sv	They are two guys that seem to find a way when they,
sv^m	When it's on the line, they seem to find a way. You know,
sv	so, those are what makes a champion I guess.
b	Yeah.
fc	Nice talking to you.
fc	Take care.
b	Yeah,
sv	As you know, I think it's more like the mess you make, isn't it?
sd	Well, when I have time I do like to sew,
sd	My mother was real heavy into crafts,
sd	So, a lot of times I'd help her with that.
aa	yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	I usually start in the fall.
sd	And my husband says I do it, you know, make afghans so I can keep my lap warm.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd^r	Mile a Minute.
ny	Yeah,
ad^t	If we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected some time or other, don't worry about it.
sd	And my husband says that's called rinky dink .
ar	No,
aa	Yeah,
ny	Yes.
t1	what else did I get in there,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	Besides they're fun to grow.
sd	Supposedly after the soil warms up.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I doubt if zucchini is in there.
sv	Probably the same time the other squash is though.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	We decided this year,
fa	I'm sorry,
aa	All right.
fc	Okay.
bh	Do you?
b	Yeah .
aa	Yeah,
sd	I love it though.
sd	I think I found my car.
b	Right.
bh	really,
sd	I have a standard.
bh	really?
sd	I hadn't heard that.
qw	What did you have before you bought that.
bh	Did you?
sd	I had, a Mazda R X Seven before that
bh	Really?
bh	Really?
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	And so I went ahead and bought another standard when I bought the Honda
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
aa	That's true.
sd	Hondas have great resale value.
sd	The Mazda definitely did not .
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
ba	Good.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	so, probably what I'll do again.
sd	But I really like the Hondas.
sd	I looked at the Mitsubishi Galant.
sd	and it was so small
sd	But I found it hard to deal with the dealership I was going through.
sd	So, that's how I ended up with a Honda.
b	Right.
b	yeah.
b	yeah.
ba	I understand.
b	Yeah.
sd	and I got it right after high school.
sd@	Ready to go. / * I really think this should be a continuation of B.101 utt 2.
b	Right.
aa	Right.
aa	Right.
sd	I was going to buy one once
sd	Just, I can't seem to get over that.
aa	Yeah,
bf	Hoping that they do go to a Honda dealership to get them serviced.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
fc	I enjoyed talking to you.
fc	Bye bye.
no	some,
sd	and the sun is trying, tries to shine through
aa	I think so,
sd	and we have, uh, Pasadena, Texas which is sort of between here an, you know, heading toward Galveston,
sv	Well, I think it's industry
h	well maybe not,
sd	you know, comes right into my air conditioner
sd	I don't know if it's, uh, if it's partly from what's blooming, you know, right now, pollen and stuff like that,
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
bk	Oh, uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qy	Do you all have pollution in your co , part of the country, uh, from industry?
bh	Really,
qr	any particular kind or just all kinds?
b	Um.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
qw	Well what can we do about the, the, the, the air conditioning problem?
b	Uh huh.
qy	Is that also what's in, uh, hairsp , aerosol?
qy^d	Even, so, so the aerosol is still aerosol,
qy^d	but it doesn't have anything that's damaging.
b	Uh huh,
sd	Here, they've just started, started doing that,
ba	No kidding,
bh	Is that right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qo	How much does, uh, planting more trees and things like that help?
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think, uh, it seems like there was something going on, around here, that, you know,
sd	and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that somebody found out, you know, like in the middle of the night, they would go ahead and do it anyway.
sd	But I wonder how much of that kind of stuff, you know, goes on.
sd	Uh, we have to, uh, we have to have a state inspection every year.
qy	Do you all have that?
qy^d	So I'm assu , I'm assuming that, you know, they check, they check everything for safety
qy^d	But that's all they check for,
sd	We do that ev , every year.
sd	Well I'll have to check,
sd	Oh, I would .
sd	I'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or, or, or anything.
b	Uh huh.
nd	Well
sv	well, you know, a lot of people have well water,
sd	if you don't get it tested you don't necessarily know what you're, what you're drinking
b	Uh huh.
sd	when I was growing up I lived in Huntsville, Alabama,
sd	and their water supply came from, uh, spring.
sd	And it was like ice cold, spring water
sv	It was really, really good.
b	Uh huh.
b	Um.
ny	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh.
b	Yeah.
sd	it's, we're doing it at N C State,
sd	we're trying to improve the computer science curriculum,
sv	So that's kind of in a higher level .
sv	So it's interesting that you chose that topic .
ny	Yeah,
ny	Oh, yeah,
sv	Well, um, in, uh, public schools I guess there wer , there are a lot of, of, you know,
sv	But, um, private school you couldn't do that,
sv	you had to learn.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh.
b	Yeah,
sd	So they're making all kind of cuts
sv	It's pretty sorry.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	N C State.
sd^r	N C State.
ny	Yeah.
ny	Well, yeah,
sd	And now I'm back here going to school.
b	Yeah.
sd	Luckily state is one of the cheap ones.
ny	Yeah.
sv	Yeah, state's not that bad .
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
qw	Where did you go?
qw^r	Where did you go?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
aa	That's true.
na	Um, graduate school .
ny	Yeah.
na	I think I'm going to Chappel Hill.
sd	That's in Chappel Hill .
ny	Yeah.
qy^d	Never heard of the, uh, Tarheels?
qy^d	The A C C Tarheels, U N C?
b	Oh, uh, .
sd	They won the final four, in boy's basket ball.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	I've got all of this stuff due
fc	All right,
fc	All right,
qw	What kind of cars do you, do you usually drive?
ba	Oh, my goodness.
b	Yeah,
sd	At least two of them.
sv	Turns out that's a pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain them
sd	And we've got a eighty four Toyota that we bought used.
sd	You're one short.
sv	but you know, it's interesting the two,
sd	as we got older and got away,
sd	And, and, of course you don't buy General Motors products over there .
sd	But we bought a Volvo
sd	And, uh, we bought a, uh,
sd	But we really liked that.
b	Um.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh, yeah.
bf	The b , the big,
b	Sure,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah,
sd	And I'm afraid we're going to be in that in another year with all of ours,
sv	And we'll probably be there with all of them.
sd	Uh, but, uh, we went on a family trip to Massachusetts
sd	And I rented a Buick Le Sabre,
sd	and it's the first big car I had since I had my nine passenger Impala station wagon from seventy six to eighty.
sv	It was just nice.
b	Oh, yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	And there is a, amazing,
sd	and, you know, we used to think Ford products were tinny.
sv	But just with the quality requirements that Ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants
sd	And, uh, uh, we went to, uh, Austin a while back to a basketball tournament
sd	and we went up to the local Budget
sd	And we drove that down
sd	We had that for three days.
b	Uh,
sd	but I absolutely loved that automobile.
sd	Uh, and, you know, we just got it out on the highway and put it in cruise control at about sixty and let it, let it float.
sv	And, it was pretty nice.
b	Um.
b	Um.
b	Yeah.
sd	Uh, we've got,
sd	it's right,
sd	I may get one and not let him have it .
sd	These, uh, uh, red Chevy pickups,
sd	and, uh, my boss just bought a Chevy pickup
ny	Yeah.
sd	So I'm going to try that the next time I buy one.
sd	And, and, so, you know, I can go around and comparison shop and see if I can get a better negotiation on my own.
b	Yeah.
^2	And for that price.
bf	We'll go somewhere else.
b	Yeah.
sd	and this guy gave me this deal, you know,
sd	I, I left there
sd	And I called the guy and made an appointment to come up Monday morning
sd	is all we paid for cars in those days.
sd	and for the longest time then I drove up to Will's Point
^h	Um,
sd	And in Sweden they have socialized medicine.
sv	Uh, some of the, some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care.
sv	So it's a very, it's a very, uh, comfortable,
sv	Um, the bad was more apparent I think at least for me
sd	Because it's treated as a disease.
sv	Also, um, another thing that, that I noticed that was very strange,
sv	Well, it would be lower middle class housing here.
sd	Um, and there was a taxi driver that lived in one of these
sv	Whereas here, there is a great incentive to be a doctor because there's a great financial reward.
sd	And that, that didn't exist in Sweden.
sv	And, uh, overall I gue , their, their health care suffered fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower
b	Right.
qy^d	You don't think it's abnormal?
b	Oh, I see.
aa	Yes.
sd	Uh, well, immigration,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sv	You know, that's not good enough.
sv	Not a good, not a good easy way to get in.
aa	Exactly.
sd	n , she'd never even meet them
nn	Huh uh.
aa	Exactly.
aa	Exactly.
sd	and they got here,
aa	I agree.
aa	Exactly.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, think of how many illegal aliens have, have, have been, uh, uh, sent back to Mexico just to find their way back.
sv	That's right,
aa	I, I agree.
fe	boy
aa	Exactly.
b	Yeah.
aa	I agree.
b	Yeah .
sv	I know there's a lot of other people out there, would probably do a good job here.
aa	I did, too.
fc	You, too.
fc	Bye.
b	Right,
b^r	Yeah.
sv	Uh, just usually pretty local in, in nature
aa	That, that's true, you know.
sd	Uh, whereas if you pick up a, a European paper, you know, uh, it, all the surrounding countries, Soviet Union, and everything has, uh, major news, uh, articles in them.
b	Yeah.
sv	and we're pretty, uh, limited in our understanding of, of leaders up in Canada or Mexico.
sv	You just don't know what's going on.
sd	every once in awhile, I have to travel overseas
sd	and you get some, like thirty minute summaries of, of news events.
sv	Uh, but that's a good point about, about the neighboring countries.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah,
sv	Or, or, i , that's just something, uh, I'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of
sd	I didn't see a thing about it.
sd	Uh, I, it surprised me.
sv	You'd think it would carry mostly religious
b	Oh well,
sv	Everybody,
ny	Yes,
sd	But, then, again, I was also in, uh, the marching band.
sd	Uh, you know, whatever
sd	I en , I enjoy the music,
sv	It always sounds like,
qw	So, how long did you play?
b^m	Three months.
sd	I was going to say, y , y , you got as far as the, uh, chop sticks, huh.
b^m	Oh, the wood chuck song .
sd(^q)	And your mother's saying, and although, the money that we spent for those piano lessons this is all we got was the wood chuck song .
ba	Oh, bless your heart.
bk	Oh, okay,
b^m	No.
bk	Okay.
sd	I played chic , uh, concertos and other stuff
sd	but I enjoy it, though.
ny	Yes,
ny	Yes,
sd	Well, I sing in the choir,
sv	That's pretty good.
sd	I actually went to the University of Texas at one time thinking that I would, c , be a musician.
sd(^q)	But after one semester of that, I said n , no, no,
sd	And besides that I kind of learned I wasn't really that good .
sd	Course, my mom thought I was,
b	Oh, yeah,
aa	Yes.
nn	No,
ny	Yeah.
sd	So I listen to the radio,
sd	I like people like Neil Diamond and all, all the folks that you're not supposed to like,
b^m	Oh, the jeezer music.
b	Oh, okay,
b	Okay,
qw	What d , what is that?
b^m	Rock.
bf	Hard rock?
qy^d	Not hard rock.
qy	Is that the eagle?
bk	Okay,
aa	That's not too hard.
aa	True,
sd	Well, course, see, I listen to K V I L for the contests.
ny	Oh, yes,
aa	Yeah .
fc	I appreciate it.
fc	Catch you later.
fc	Bye bye.
ny	Yeah.
sd	It's, It's, it's, plywood, face, I guess.
sd	But I cut it out in the shape of a crayon box
ny	yes .
aa	yeah.
ny	yeah.
b	Oh.
b	okay.
ba	That's great.
qw	what type of art do you focus on?
b	Yeah.
ba	That's great!
aa	Right.
qw	So you have a M F A in what division of art?
bk	okay.
b	Yeah.
b^r	yeah.
b@	* slash error
b^r	Yeah.
ba	that's great.
b@	* slash error
b@	Yeah. / * slash error
b	yeah.
^2	And your time,
b	Right.
sv	That's neat.
ny	Yes.
ba	I'm sure.
qy^d	A band saw?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
^2	A cradle for it.
b	Right,
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	Well, I'm envisioning, a watermelon like a log
b	Yeah.
sd	But, uh, I've heard people that I work with talk about, you know, child care.
b	Yeah.
sv	Which is understandable.
ba	Oh, no.
b^m	Yeah.
sv	It was easy, you know, go over to some, uh,
sv	it was great.
sd	that was a long time ago
h	But I don't know.
aa	Oh, yeah.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
^2	She does take up,
sv	They're very demanding .
fe	Oh, shoot.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah,
sv	And just have like t , at the most, like ten kids.
sv	Instead of trying actually to set up a daycare where you don't know the people coming in and ...
b	Yeah.
bf	More than what it's worth?
b^m	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	you can't watch that many little kids getting into things at one time .
sv	You know, you never know what they're going to get into.
ba	Oh, that's horrible.
b	Huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I just, I couldn't do it I don't think.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
qw^h	What about,
sv	because that's the lowest thing for themselves,
sv	But I also blame some of it on parents
sv	because parents aren't parents.
sd	Because I remember even when I was growing up,
sd	I remember when I was growing up,
sd	And I knew that I would get in more trouble from my mother than from from anybody else.
sv	And I think that's the basic, is they have no morals any more,
sv	so they don't care.
sd	But now, as far as what they can do about it, I don't know.
sv	I guess if you gave the, gave them jobs,
sv	That would work to a point,
sv	Well, that'd work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway.
sv	so I think it depends on how much trouble that kid has been in, you know.
sv	Because a, a, a child can get into anything regar ,
sd	I don't care how good you, they are.
sd	but now if this is a repeated thing,
sv	Because that means she's still not doing what she's supposed to do.
qy^d	I don't know if you seen this.
sd	it was a little, it was a little gang of them stealing cars, you know,
sd	And then when they caught him, you know, his mother sitting there,
sv	But see, by that, I think sometimes it's a little late.
sv	but I'm sure there's something can be done.
ny	Yeah,
sv	Well, they should start with, the,
sv	You ought to take all them little misdemeanor people
ad	let them go,
ad	you know, give them a fine, whatever,
ad	Put them fools in there,
sd	I call them all fools, idiots, whatever.
ad	Little rock stars, put all them in there.
ad	You know, the murderers, the drug dealers, the user, put them all in
ad	and let all the normal people go
qy^g	if you write a bad check, you go to jail, right.
ad	Let them people go.
sd	Not let them go and get out of it.
ad	Let them go and pay their crime or their time doing something else you know, like cleaning up the city or however they do their community time, you know, whatever that is .
sv	But pu , don't put them in jail because they're not hardened criminals.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Now how they going to fix it, I don't know.
sv	Because the economy is down, people, you know, the, the, the low man on the pole is getting more of the, I guess, the bulk of it.
sv	And he's got to work extra hard just to make ends meet.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's it.
sd	So, you know, they, I, I, I know that's bad, but, you know, just like Texas now.
sd	They could have had a lottery.
sd	Because, you know, they take,
sd	Because we're paying for Social Security they using now.
qw	Who's going to pay for mine?
aa	No,
sd	that's what I'm saying,
sv	Crime is going to go up as long as the economy stays down.
sv	And it's going to get worse.
sd	That's just like last night they killed them people in that store.
bk	Oh .
sd	I'm in Dallas.
sd	But last night, they killed, uh, uh, four people in a chain food.
sd	And killed them,
sd	One was a store and one was like a, a fast food place,
sd	Anyway, they raped the women, beat them all up, including the women,
qw	Why was, you know, why
qw	you know, why didn't they just,
sv	They didn't have to kill them or rape them, or anything.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I think, if it's,
sd	and everybody knows everybody
sv	it's harder to come in there and do something.
sv	and, and, and see that's another thing.
sv	There's nobody is next door to you,
sd	because I moved out some apartments before because they were loaded with drug dealers.
sd	and what the manager, the manager won't even do anything.
b	Uh huh.
aa	You don't.
sd	and this is like across the street.
sd	and there across the street one of the apartments blew up because they were having that, making that, um, crack stuff
sd	and then, the other time I saw the cops break down somebody's apartment around the corner.
aa	That's it,
sd	And, you know, now I live in like a fam , a neighborhood in a town house,
sv	I don't know how they can live, a neighborhood or apartment complex.
sv	Or rent to them and evict them because they drug dealers.
^q	If you deal drugs, you can't live here.
aa	Uh huh.
fc	All righty.
ft	And I thank you.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	You just wear, uh,
sd	And, uh, so, I get to wear just, uh, how shall I say it, uh, walking shoes as opposed to dress shoes and well walking, how shall I say it, kind of like Avia, uh, walking shoes, uh,
aa	Yes.
sd	And, uh, just, uh, reasonable looking, how shall I say it, uh, sports clothes or some guys wear, some people even wear Levis.
qy^g	Now, being from Philadelphia, I don't expect your dress code to be quite that relaxed, right?
bk	Oh, okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
sv	And it, it was very interesting,
na	Well, it has been.
sd	so anyway I wore this suit
sd	and it, and I, I was almost converted because, uh, the effect of that suit on the way people res , reacted and responded to me as opposed to the,
sd	So people, uh, how shall I say it, made a, made much more effort to notice you, acknowledge your presence, say hello and, uh, things like that,
b	Yeah.
sv	And so this dress for success thing, I think is, uh,
sd	Doesn't mean they have to be, uh,
sv	but, uh, a little dressing a little bit above the standard, I think, would, uh, pay off
h	And, uh, I, I don't know,
sd	Not hot like, uh,
sd	And I know that, uh, you know, it can be freezing cold in the wintertime, and hot and, uh, sticky in the summertime.
sd	We don't have that much.
ny	Yes,
sd	And, the interesting scale that they assigned it, the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free .
sd	but there still, the technology exists to check it if they want.
sd	I have shot a variety of guns for a number of years,
sd	I don't even keep the gun in our house,
sd	so I don't have that problem,
b	Uh huh.
ba@	Uh huh. Boy.
b	Right.
sd	Dallas.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	you know, the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming,
sv	and had time to do anything about it.
sd	And, I don't have that problem,
sv	And you have a earn a right,
sd	you know, there's all sorts of arguments there
sd	but, I don't even want to worry about what the original intent was,
sd	they didn't have this problem back then .
sv	So, we change our rights with our social status.
sd	They're man given rights
sd	the people that hide behind that, I don't worry about.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
b^r	Right.
b	Yeah.
bf	Tends to, tends to strap only the legitimate people.
sv	it's very difficult to, legislate, crooks or however you want to word it
sv	well, this may be a never ending topic.
fc	Okay, bye.
aa	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
b	Yes.
b^r	Yes.
b	Right .
b	yeah.
aa	Oh, I think so.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and they had, they used to look down on women that were home,
sd	and I used to be infuriated,
sd	because they really had no idea what was involved once I got home.
sv	And, there's a lot of truth to that
^q	I wish I was the one,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That's true.
b	Yes.
b	Right.
^2	And they enjoy it.
aa	you're right.
sv	and I think that is healthy because ch ,
aa	Right.
aa	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	Oh, boy .
b	Yeah.
h	Well,
aa	well, that, that's true.
b	um,
b	Oh, oh, yeah.
sd	And their meal is served
sv	And I think, I think this reaction comes more out of fear.
sd	He comes from a culture where women are, stay at home and do everything,
sd	um, and yet, um, he's the type that he is willing to have to take on more responsibility, um, if that meant, , {door} you know, for me to be able to, uh, uh, advance or go back to work or whatever.
t3	{talking to someone in background}, they're downstairs Aaron, {resumes talking to A}
sd	I refused to work more than thirty.
sd	I was part time
sv	but I think you have to put in perspective, that, you know, when the kids came home from school, I wanted to be here.
sv	I thought it was kind of a strange topic about corruption in the government and how many people are self serving.
sv	I mean, you I, I think people tend to think that the government is not corrupt . And that people aren't self serving.
sv	I mean that's what I would like to think.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right .
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sv	And sometimes, you know, I don't even know how much of a difference it really makes, you know.
sv	I mean, I guess in some cases, sure we care about what they did in the past
h	but, sometimes, I don't know
sv	I think it gets in the way of the better judgment.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but I don't really play an active role in any kind of politics .
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
qw	What kind of a car do you have now?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	You got kids?
bk	Okay.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Huh.
sd	Uh, mostly because my wife's stepfather works at a Ford dealership .
b	Yeah.
sd	and we've got a minivan,
sv	and that's great.
sd	And, uh, and this Escort took it all.
sd	So I, I, I bought a used, uh, Dodge Aries, which has been okay.
sd	I, I mean I've haven't had it that long.
sd	But it, it al , it's an eighty five Aries,
sd	And I just, you know, I just drive it to work.
sd	So, uh, it doesn't get much of, uh,
sv	and it's a four door which is nice,
sv	but it's still a little cramped.
aa	Yeah,
bh	Oh, really?
ba	Ooh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b^r	Right,
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	Oh, no!
b	Yeah .
b	Yeah.
sd	They'd, they'd buy themselves a sporty car because it was their last.
sd	And, uh, because I got a good deal on it
sd	and, uh, that was a great little car.
sd	And, uh, in fact I married one of those people .
sd	And it worked.
b	Yeah,
b^r	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah .
ba	Wow!
ba	That's weird!
b	Huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean, she'd always driven standard transmission.
sd	in fact all our earlier cars were a standard transmission.
sd	this Dodge Aries is the first car we've ever gotten that had anything.
sv	You know, it's like, it's like a luxury car except that it's the Dodge Aries , you know.
sv	the, the thing about this, uh, th ,
sv	We thought that was a luxury car when we bought it.
aa	Yeah.
sd	We never had it, you know,
sd	And, uh, of course this has, this that had s , speakers that you can control from the back seat.
sd	And you can change the channels on the, on the radio from the back seat too .
sd	And put s , speaker phones in it.
aa	Right.
aa	That's right.
sd	And you've got to pay for it too.
sv	And I bet, and I bet it costs twice as much as, as when I bought mine .
ft	Thanks a lot.
fc	Bye bye
fp	Fine,
aa	Yes.
sd	well , I just got through reading, SPACE by, James Michener.
sv	And so that, helped out a little bit I think.
aa	Well, he tends to go into a lot of detail sometimes.
qy	is that right?
^h	Well , I'm not sure to be honest with you,
sv	it was nice to go there,
sd	I happen to live not too far away from,
sd	And, you know, that's been kind of a real negative feeling here
sv	sure it was, you know, very unfortunate thing that occurred there
sd	we live in, Utah.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
br	Pardon me?
nn^e	No, my last name is Skidmore.
sd	And her husband's name is, his last name is Weight.
sd	Well, they were.
sd	I mean, they're as long as a football field practically and about twelve foot in diameter
sd	and there is a lot of thrust to get that much weight up in the air.
sv	I,
sd	the thing that he went into quite a bit of detail about how much of a problem it is to re enter the Earth's atmosphere.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
sd	and if they come into it at a different angle there is so much friction that it burns them up.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	I've seen more of the motors that they produced out there.
b	Uh huh.
sd	People have commented how, they were surprised at how small they were.
qy^d	Looked pretty confining,
qy	Is that right?
ng	Not really. ,
sd	One thing's,
sd	It's perfectly round.
sv	But I'm not sure you have to go to outer space to achieve that zero gravity.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
sd	I appreciate having the satellites.
sv	but I I know that's certainly helped a lot in that regard.
sd	that's one of my favorite kinds of dogs.
qw	How long have you had it?
b^m	Fourth birthday.
qy	Does he shed a lot?
qw	How much does he weigh now?
b	Oh.
qy	Is he good with family?
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, we have a cat who's also about four years old.
sd	And he's our spoiled child right now, too .
sd	And he also sheds a lot.
sd	But, we hope to get a Golden Retriever someday.
nn	No,
qy	is your dog an inside and outdoors?
bh	really?
qy	when he gets outside, does he run away and then eventually come back?

b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
sd	Well, we just moved recently
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
aa	That's true.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No.
aa	I agree.
^2	Are extremely poor.
b	Uh huh.
bf	And, and just very happy to get that.
sd	I have a brother who spent two years in Bolivia.
sd	And this is very much his, you know, reaction that the rich are so rich and the poor are so poor.
b	Uh huh,
ba	Oh, gosh.
b	Yep .
o	Intentions, intentions .
aa	I know.
sd	And seventeen children, filtered through into, into America through Guatamala, through Mexico, through Honduras,
sd	you know, two here, three there, one here, you know, this kind of thing until,
sd	and now, uh, couple of the older ones stayed or went back,
aa	Yes.
aa^r	Yes.
b	Uh huh,
bf	The technology.
b	Well,
sv	It's kind of a catch twenty two.
b	Yeah,
b	Well,
sv	You know, that's really, uh, kind of a far fetched idea,
sv	but it's like in any sibling rivalry
^2	In the long run.
qy	Course, then could, you know, at, at some point, could you ever convince someone to turn around and grow something that was productive for humankind.
sv	I mean even their, even their legal crops are things that we don't perceive as being healthy now from a medical standpoint of view, coffee tobacco you know .
sd	They're certainly legal,
nn	No,
sv	Well, let's just hope that the powers that be, uh, have time to, a little bit once in a while to, to think in some farther reaching avenues than you and I do here tonight
fc	Well, it's been nice chatting with you.
fc	I appreciate it,
fc	It's kind of nice to, to see old friends now, you see.
fc	Bye now.
sv	I don't think we have one.
b	Yeah.
b	Well, uh,
sv	But we just talked a lot.
sv	I'm actually surprised at anything in Central America, along with Panama.
aa	Especially, after our friend Jimmy Carter gave it away anyway.
sv	But I guess they had to finally do something.
sv	He has a little more d , a little more of a stand on policy than I thought he would.
b	Yeah.
sv	But, but I guess most of the policy that we're using now is, uh, a combination of Reagan and Carter, much as, you know, policy makers.
b	Uh, yeah.
sv	Of course, we really haven't taken on the drug lords, yet.
sv	I'd be interested to see if we do that.
sv	Well, we did in Panama.
sv	It could be an interesting, interesting problem.
sv	I don't know if they could do it or not.
sv	I think you need to pick that up and read it.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	Actually, he, he wrote that prior to the, uh, Med , Medellin Cartel being exposed.
sv	But I don't think we're going to have much of a choice in e , either Central or South America.
b	Um, yeah.
sv	We still, there's still t , there's still too many Kennedys and Misinvolves and Udalls all up there.
sv	There's too many liberals in control.
sv	Of course, these are the same people that also drown blonde, the Chappaquiddic, and stuff like that, you know.
sv	I guess it's automatic respective.
b	Yeah.
sv	And these are the people that make the foreign policy
sv	Considering the Kennedys made all their money off bootleg whiskey anyway.
sv	Every time you drink Scotch, you're paying Kennedys.
ba	Good.
b	Yeah.
sv	Although we do need to do something about, you know,
sv	Well, I think basically, they can't figure out what they want down there.
sv	If you give everybody what they wanted there is a complete democracy, those people wouldn't know how to react because they have no education.
sv	It's all tradition.
fc	It was very pleasant.
sd	Tom, Clancy.
aa	Uh huh.
sv	And I think i , if you read that, I think you'll get a real kick out of it.
bd	All righty.
fc	Bye.
b	Um.
b^r	Um.
sd	Well, I talked to a woman who lived up in the hills, uh, mountains in, uh, Utah, I guess this last weekend
b	Um .
b	Yeah,
sd	But, uh, we have wide variations and have warm weather when most people have cold weather,
sd	We usually have some of our coldest weather toward the, uh, end of January,
b	Oh, yeah.
sd	They have a, uh, lake cabin
sd	So we really had a lot of rain.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
sd	Not more than ten
sd	Well, the, uh, there's an old profane expression about Texas weather,
ar	Well, El Paso won't be cold.
nn	No,
qy^d	The, uh, you'll be flying in there?
sv	Well, uh, take off is, uh, fun from El Paso because you normally,
sd	and they're towering above you
b	Oh,
sd	Well, I noticed on the weather map on, uh, cable network that there was supposed to be a storm front moving into California and on down your way,
x*	/ * listen; dropped phone is probably comment not utterance, should be in fixed 7 14 97 NC
b	Huh.
ba	Oh, boy.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I think, uh the elderly is a really neat population to care for.
sv	They've got a lot of special needs
sv	And so you've got a real balance to make there.
qo	What about you?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Oh really.
b	Oh, okay.
b	Yeah,
sd	and she's, uh, suffering from, uh, well, uh, progressive Alzheimer's Disease
sd	so she doesn't remember anybody
sd	and, uh, she remembers things,
sd	she was living by herself
sd	and it's creating a lot of problems.
ny	Oh yes.
^h	In Dallas,
aa	Right.
b	Oh really.
b	Uh huh,
sv	and I think that's in a way it's more, some, an area where some of the day care, uh, programs have left off
sd	because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those.
b^r	Right.
sd	But if your vision is gone and you have arthritis real badly,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Well, that's true.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	And they love to recollect.
ng	My grandmother doesn't .
sv	which is fine, you know,
qy	Have you done this very long?
b	Yeah,
qw	Well, what kind of car would you buy?
bk	Oh, okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
bk	Oh, okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh, uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Oh, really?
sd	We've always bought American made cars, mostly Oldsmobiles.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	we have a Cutlass, we still have a Cutlass Supreme which is like, a seventy seven.
sd	Then we have a Cutlass Sierra
h	but I don't know,
sd	But, I don't know what we're going to buy.
b	Oh.
ba	Ooh, boy.
sv	I'll bet it was hard to part with that.
b	Oh.
b	Oh, yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh .
sd	And, uh, most of the time with a three year old we're trying to, to get him, uh,
sd	and trying to supervisor him with that and everything and, uh, playing squirt guns and all that,
sd	And, uh, the one year old just kind of follows along and does everything,
nn	No,
ny	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
aa	Well, I, I agree with that,
sv	Uh, the only other thing I have noticed though is that, uh, it seems that there's been a lot of or more empha , emphasis at least in what we've been dealing with
sd	For, for a three year old it's that, uh,
sv	And, and it seems like it's a lot more than the , they need to know and be able to do than when we are the, when I had to go in t , ki , kindergarten.
sv	And it seems like it's more, uh,
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	Educational games like, you know, concentration type games, the matching, things like that.
sd	And, uh, he's, he really likes it
sd	And given, given that knowledge and stuff with it
sv	and he seems to enjoy it.
sd	And, uh, of course, the one year old hasn't, hasn't gotten there yet
sd	there's a little soccer thing that he's going to do for a week or so
sd	because, uh, when he was a baby that we did the swimming too
aa	I know.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And, uh, you know, that's just a problem that who knows how that's going to, that's going to come out or anything.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sv	but uh, now I think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone and says, Mrs Miller, have we got a deal for you.
sd(^q)	It's like, how do you know my name,
sv	I mean, those people, they'll call you any time of the day or night with, try to solicit
sv	and that's an invasion of my privacy, I think.
sd	Oh, they do already.
b	Well,
ny	Uh huh.
sd	But I do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls.
ad	Don't answer your phone, Hello.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Oh, yeah.
qy	Are you and your roommate a similar size.
qy^d	And she still goes through your clothes?
b	Uh huh.
ba	Ooh.
b	Oh, yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Oh, yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh, yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	My mom doesn't even like for us to go through her cabinets.
sd	I mean, we're all grown,
sd(^q)	and now if we go through her cabinets she's like, Well, what are you digging for?
sd(^q)	Like, what are you doing?
b	Yeah,
sd	I hate it for people to open up my drawer to my desk
sd	because that was, that was where I kept all my stuff,
sd	It would drive, it drove me batty for a while.
ny	Yeah,
sd	and everybody else in my area worked first shift
sd	and our shifts overlapped
sd	so I would come in,
^q	Can I have it back soon, maybe.
ny	Oh, yeah,
b	Oh, yeah.
aa	Oh, yeah,
qy	Do you miss your papers sometimes?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	and it, it really is an invasion of privacy,
ny	Yeah.
sd	I mean, I've, I've used it once,
qw^t	What are we supposed to discuss again?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yes.
sv	some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research
sv	then t , part of it's lack of education.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And I'm, I am concerned a lot about, uh, I'm concerned about, uh, two things.
sd	And I'm not certain,
sv	But whether or not it would be, uh, our money would be better spent, uh, teaching, you know, working on the drug problems and the, and the sex problems, uh, rather than trying to cure the people that already have it.
b	Yeah,
sd	An , and I heard something the other day, this sounds ridiculous, about mosquitoes.
sd	And I don't know that's true or not.
qw	what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and ,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sv	I think maybe more information should be given out about it.
ad	I, I, give me cyanide.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
qh	And why can't you, why can't the F D A say, you know, i , if these people knowingly consent to be, research monkeys and well, let them,
ad	let them, do it.
b	Right.
b	Oh, yes
b	Right.
aa	Oh absolutely,
sv	You just got a lot of, you know, a lot of pollution from those
aa	Absolutely.
b	Right.
aa	That's, that's very true.
b	Right.
aa	I guess so.
b	Right.
aa	Well, I agree with that
aa	Exactly,
sv	Well, that may be true, too.
b	Uh huh,
sd	I, I did some work for the, uh, Women's League of, uh, Voters, uh, several years ago
aa^m	It's a, it's an ongoing campaign
aa	Exactly,
aa	Oh, well, I agree with that,
aa	No,
aa	Exactly.
sv	he possibly could have, uh, won that election had it not been for some of the , the, uh, the way he presented himself.
aa	Hoof, is, is, I guess the right term for him.
sv	That's good to hear.
ng	Uh, the one, the most valueless girl doesn't,
sd	But, it, it's kind of weighed on me
sd(^q)	I'm like, really.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh, yeah.
b	Right.
sd	On Sunday we just met, uh, a family,
sd	And you can tell, it's a family hobby.
b	Yeah,
sd	Well that's what we're going to end up getting .
b	Oh, yeah.
ba	Oh, I know.
ba	Oh!
b	No,
ny	Yeah.
sd	We're hoping,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	That's true,
b	Yeah,
sd	And I think of those,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Right.
aa	Yeah,
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
b^r	Yeah.
sd	Uh, we just bought, uh, acre, a house with an acre to try to, so she'll have some room to walk around, and not off of a busy street.
sd	We're, we're choosing our house for our cat.
sd	Oh, them too .
sd	We , because I, she loves, she's one of those that loves th , outside,
sd	and, and she doesn't go far
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
aa	Oh, I know.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	I, we, we got married a few months ago
aa	Yeah,
b	Oh.
ba	Oh, my.
b	No .
sv	I, I don't think they'd like to.
sd	I put a bow on her one ni , one day
ny	Um, yeah,
ny	oh yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	she's frustrated.
ny	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
aa	Exactly.
b	Oh.
qr	Did you do the diagnosis, or was it just an assumption that that's probably the part that failed?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah, I know,
^2	Diagram.
b	Yeah,
sd(^q)	you tend to think, well, there's one fuse operating the whole thing,
sv	So, that's a possibility.
qy	Is this a, a mail order parts house that specializes in, in parts for parts for, uh, old imports?
b	Um
b	Yeah,
b	Oh, yeah.
ba	I'll be darned.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Oh, my goodness.
ba	Oh, no.
sd	Well, ours wasn't within the last year.
sd	And the other problem Judy would have is occasionally she would, uh, be driving along, uh, decelerating, like coming to a stop sign, but not yet stopped at the stop sign
sd	and the engine would just quit.
sd	which fortunately they replaced under warranty, because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part
sd	and, uh, so once they replaced it, then the, the car seemed to work fine for a considerable period of time,
sd	and now it seems to be,
aa	Yeah.
ba	That's great.
sv	and there's not a whole lot you can do without the equipment and electronic analysis that needs to be done on a car,
ba	dear.
ba	that's too bad.
b	Oh.
aa	yes.
b	Oh.
qy	And did you install all that yourself?
qy^d	Well, that was, I bet that was a lot of fun.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's too bad.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah.
ba	Well, you know, that's fine.
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	dear.
b	Uh huh.
ba	dear.
qy^g	 I bet that was frustrating, wasn't it?
aa	Right,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	so he took it into a shop and had it resurfaced and fixed that way.
b	yeah.
sd	Well, seeing as how I'm a musician , I like all kinds of music.
sd	All very very kinds.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Do you ?
^2	Jazz.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	In fact I sing with a Texas baroque ensemble.
sd	Well, we used to have, Ralph Dutchen.
sd	But now he is in Massachusetts.
sd	And he has played.
sd	Rick, Bogarts played too
sd	, but actually, I like trumpet and organ together.
ny	Yeah,
sd	With Paul.
qy	So do you like romantic music?
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you ever go to the Dallas Opera?
b	Uh huh.
qw	Who was your trumpet teacher?
b	Uh huh.
qy	Is he still around here?
sd	Because I have not seen him playing anywhere lately,
sd	Well, I am basically a Church musician.
sd	And we do all kinds of music at my Church
sd	The Christ United Methodist Church in Plano .
aa	Yeah.
sd	He plays at our Church a lot.
na	I think so.
sd	and, I think he teaches at Brookhaven.
b	Yeah,
sv	the two of them are mainly pretty much the, they have cornered the market on trumpet.
na	I'm sure,
qo	so what do you think in the short term we should be doing to improve it?
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah,
b	Right.
sv	And, there isn't any sort of overall accountability,
sv(^q)	like you were saying you say, you know, hey, you know, we just cut defense,
sd	that's being batted around.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right .
aa	Uh huh,
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sv	I mean, you don't expect to make any money out of it.
sv	And I don't have the feeling that national level politicians are at all like that.
aa	Yeah.
sv	But on the other hand, maybe that's,
b	Yeah.
sd	I used to, live in the Ozarks and, liked to go up there and just take a backpack and strike out into the woods.
aa	Yeah.
ng	I haven't done it in quite awhile since I moved down here.
sd	But I used to do it quite a bit.
ny	Yeah,
sd	it was real hilly.
sd	Take a twenty two
sd^r	Take a twenty two
sd	I used to go with my brother.
sd	We just lived up there.
b	Yeah,
sd	But I don't know much about camping in Texas.
qy	You live in Pennsylvania? .
sd	I didn't know they did this.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I used to be in Ohio,
b	Yeah.
sv	just set it up
^h	Tell you what,
sd^c	I said I'm losing you,
ny	Yeah.
qy	you try to go and take a vacation every year and go out and camp?
b	Yeah.
sv	That's kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping.
sd	copperheads mostly,
aa	No,
aa	Yeah.
sd	I don't know what it was,
sd	and then it was all year,
ny	Yeah.
sd	If it rained we were stuck back in there.
sd	You just get used to it.
ny	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
bh	really?
qy^g	they don't have them up there do they?
ny	Yeah.
bh	do they?
b	Yeah,
sd	I don't know what it's like now,
sv	Well, it's good to get out and smell some fresh air, too.
b	Yeah.
fc	Yeah.
fc	You, too.
fc	Bye.
fp	Fine.
ny	Yes.
b	are you.
ny	Yeah,
aa	I know,
sd	It was a lot nicer than I expected.
sd^t	I've talked to,
aa	Yes,
qy^t	did you push the button?
qy^d	Did we,
b	Okay,
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
ba	Well, isn't that neat.
ba	Isn't that neat.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's neat.
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right
ba	Well, that's good.
ba	That's great.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Well, it was really sad, heartbreaking, I guess.
sd	And, I just felt for those people, especially the ones that never got visited.
sd	That just bothered me.
sd	That just bothered me so much, especially, you know, at my age,
sd	And that really made a bad impression on me .
b	Right.
aa	Helps,
aa	Uh huh,
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sv	You know, sometimes that even helps them, just being around young people to, because some of them are so, just stationary
sv	I mean, they'll get in a wheelchair
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	Stagnant .
sd	and that scares me.
sv	It's sad to think that we would do that to people,
sd(^q)	And I just think, how can you do that?
sv	and here is how we treat them.
b	Uh huh .
b	Right.
aa	Right.
sd	and that's one of my favorite things to do is sit around and listen to their stories.
sv	I think that's neat,
sd	he had him late in life,
sd	And he lives with different, you know, people in the family.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Lock him up.
aa	I know,
aa	Right,
aa	That's right.
^q	you're going to put me away.
sd	That's what my mother,
aa	I know.
b	Right.
ba	Gosh.
b	Right.
b	Yes.
ba	man.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sv	and you take away that driving ability
ny	Yeah.
nd	Well, luckily he drives a big old tank .
sv	So, I mean, I don't think he, he could get hurt.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I saw that on TWENTY TWENTY.
no	you know, they're testing that, they're, you know, thinking of doing that.
sv	and that doesn't help.
b	Right.
sv	At least that way the burden is not on the family of taking their license or their car away .
sv	It's on the state .
qo	Well, what do you think?
b	Uh huh.
aa	Well, I agree that it's a big task,
sv	And possibly, just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing,
sv	just because it seems that, health insurance costs are sky rocketing, well, as fast as the national deficit perhaps
sv	and that's a that's a vicious cycle, of course.
nd	Well, well, I wouldn't exclude the possibility of the government actually administrating it ultimately.
b	Right.
sv	well, as it is now, the middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because they're the only people that can afford health insurance
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
nd^t	I didn't quite hear all of it.
b	Right .
sd	Well, I really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else.
na	Well, a little bit for the price,
sd	but, I think that as far as quality of food goes some of the most expensive places I've been had the, really the, the worst quality of food.
na^m	Really.
sd	some of the best food I have ever had was outside or inside of a place that we drove up
qy	Yeah.
sd	I'm serious.
sd	one place that we went just recently was to Atchafalaya.
ar	No,
t3	What's the name of that restaurant?
sd	Kalachandji's.
ny	Yes.
na	I think so.
sd	it starts with a K.
sd	So . K A L A, I think, C H A N D.
sd	That should get you close enough to be able to find it.
sd	But it's just fabulous food.
na	Well, we like Arby's. As far as, fast food goes.
bh	really?
ar	no,
ba	my goodness.
sd	I'm surprised.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Well, that's happened before.
sd	But w , we're, we like Mexican food.
sd	And stuff like that.
qy^h	A health food?
ad	name one .
sd	I'm not sure what you're talking about.
sd	I don't guess I've ever been to anything like that
sv	It would be good I think,
qw^d	I don't know how expensive they are.
qy	For one person?
bk	Oh .
sv	A bit .
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
qw	Now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken?
sd	That's one of my husband's pet peeves.
sv	catfish is wonderful.
b	really.
b	Really.
qw	Why?
bk	Oh.
sd	That's too bad, because I'm probably not going to stop eating it .
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's true.
sd	So they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically.
sd	And then they take these things that will rust
b	Oh.
sd	And this is before I was born.
sd	So, I mean we're taking thirty years ago, this happened,
sv	and you know, the tuna is radioactive to a certain extent.
sv	You can't get away from it
b^m	yeah,
aa	Certainly.
sd	And it has been sort of raining on and off.
sd	And, I am an avid gardener
sd	but it has been threatening to rain for the last couple of days,
qo	How about Pennsyl ,
na	It starts in, March as a rule.
bh	Really,
qy	Could you have snow?
sd	well, we do not have that problem .
ba	that is nice.
sd	well, I will be glad to give you some of ours .
sd	And then it stops for three months.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I know the weather is very important for people who make their living off of, off of the land.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, you know there are some disadvantages to being down south.
sv	And that is, it gets so hot that, you know, a lot of things die during the Summer from the heat.
aa	they really do,
sv	and you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	it is very rough on them
sd	Actually I think it is pretty moderate here in Dallas.
qw	what is your humidity like?
sd	I do not know what it is percentage wise
b	Yeah.
sd	But it is not dry.
qy	does he live near the lake?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that is a problem,
sd	And, I know exactly what you mean.
b	Uh huh.
ba	well, that is fortunate.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and this is very much home for me.
qy^d	I hope you visited during the winter.
sv	one of my theories is that you always go to warm places during the winter
b	sure.
sd	I had a friend from England visit once at Christmas,
sd	And she went back to the north of England with a sunburn .
b	Well, yeah,
sv	Well, that, that is really healthier, frankly.
b	Uh huh.
sv	But you know, it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot.
sd	And, she is five years younger than me,
ny	Yeah,
sv	and I think that is why.
aa	Yes.
aa	Yes,
ba	Good.
ba	Well, that is great.
sd	probably four or five days.
ft	Well, thank you .
fc	A pleasure.
fc	I am sure I will.
fc	Well, I am glad you have broken the ice with me because now, I will start doing it .
fc	Okay.
fc	Well, thanks, Jean.
fc^m	Bye bye.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I probably would have to agree with you pretty much all the way I think.
sv	I definitely think that some things shouldn't be limited like you said, rifles and hunting rifles and possible handguns for people who use them to,
aa	Right.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	Right,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv(^q)	Well, in that ca , I think that cases like that it's definitely, I think if you're to say okay,
aa	Right,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
sd	because he used to hunt years ago
sd	and I knew we had the guns in the house
sd(^q)	but it was never, my brothers, sisters nor I never, I mean none of us ever thought well let's go look at the gun
sd	and it was your father's
sv	and that's the thing that should be, you know, stressed.
sd	Basically about the same as what you've probably had.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	you like the rain, do you?
b	Uh huh.
bh	are you?
nn	No.
na	I'm a summer person
na	I like the heat.
b	Yeah,
sd	I just don't like the cold.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	the other thing is I don't like the rain either.
sd	Well, we have several children that are in sports,
sd	I like it better, I think.
b	Uh huh.
sd	The thing about when it gets hot here is, I don't like the humidity,
b	really.
bh	is that right?
sd	well, I guess I can't say that I don't like the rain completely.
sd	and, you know, I don't know if that's because plants are just that way
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Well I like seventies I like seventies okay.
ng	I don't like nineties.
sd	You can give me seventies
sd	and you can give me eighties
sd	and I'm okay.
sd	I stay in the house because it's just, It's just too hot.
aa	Yeah,
bd	That's okay .
sv	It just really gets way,
sd	and we've been here for several years,
^2	Years,
aa	Yeah,
sv	A good weather man,
aa	Yeah.
ad	you don't have to wait for them to say cut off your time.
ad(^q)	You just say, Have a good day or whatever.
fc	You too.
fc	You too.
sd	as a matter fact, I work out in the mornings.
sd	And, I have got a routine for every morning of the week
sd	but, I do a combination of, running and weight training .
nn	No,
sd	But, I pretty much, worked on my own routine.
sd	They have got the track on the inside.
sd	And, I run one mile on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays
sd	And then after that, I work out with weights.
sd	I work out with free weights.
ny	yeah.
na	about seven minutes.
nn	no
b	Yeah,
ny	yeah.
sd	And I wouldn't be able to work out anything else.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bk	I see.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	I see.
b	I see.
bk	I see,
sd	So, I was just wandering if that was what it was or something.
qy	So do you have any plans of maybe running more when the weather gets nicer?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	and, I could do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves.
sd	but, it has been a while since I have done that.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	that is why, well, you know, I was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and seeing what different exercises they could get me on to, get out of the routine.
sd	Because I have heard that, you know, you get locked into a routine then you are going to get to a point where you just stop developing.
sd	So, I am looking at changing things a little bit.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
fp	Good morning .
b	Uh huh.
qw	What do you play?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I play, the violin and play trumpet
sd	and I run a municipal band
sd	So, I'm pretty busy too.
sd	We have a nice big one here in State College, called the Nitny Valley Symphony.
sd	I play in the Altoona Symphony,
sd	and I play in a slightly smaller one called the Lockhaven Symphony and Community Orchestra.
nn	No,
sd	only I should have been.
sd	But, I've been working at, Penn State and using up all my nighttimes, and weekends going to these orchestra rehearsals and concerts and so forth.
qy^d	You have one that often.
sd	That's amazing because I, I have it set up here that we have at least six to seven rehearsals per concert.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
sv	You are busy.
qw	Where do you get all this music,
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qw	How many people in your band?
b^m	Seventy.
ba	Holy mackerel,
b	Uh huh.
ba	Boy,
sd	Because about the best I can normally hope for is about fifty in, in the band I have here.
sd	But that fills a stage and keeps us busy,
sd	And so they want to play things that, push them to do.
sd	We have about four concerts per year indoors and two or three that we play outside.
sd	And the last one we did was in a large, mall close here,
sd	So that worked out very nicely.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow,
bk	Okay.
qw	And where does this happen, Laurie,
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, I declare.
ba	That's amazing.
b	Okay.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I work the same way .
ba	Well, I'll be darned.
b^m	Okay.
sd	And we just don't want that.
sd	And plus, we both like to cook,
ba	my gosh.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	so if you're, if you're not doing any kind of sport thing you go to one of your sisters' or brothers' sporting events. And sort of like be there with them.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, that's good, too, I mean, as far as entering,
sv	I mean at least you're encouraging them on and stuff
sd	because, even if our kids, you know, get into sports that we're really not interested in, I want them, you know, to know that we're still there so to speak, as a family.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
qy	do people go off in their own little groups with that many?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
bk	I see.
b	Yeah.
qw	I mean, what did you do when you were younger,
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Hurling.
bk	hurtle,
bf	So you had a lot of games and things you played even when you were kids with the ones that you,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
bk	okay.
sd	I mean, I don't speak with many people that come from families that large any more.
sd	but, I mean, that's his mother you know,
sv*	and their Catholic / * they're
sv	Well that's it then, I think,
qr	But, I mean, do you see yourself having thirteen kids or twelve kids?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	But it's so expensive, man.
sv	I would think for your parents it would still be hard even nowadays, I mean, just to raise twelve kids.
sv	Would be, shoosh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well sometimes I think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though, you know.
sv	so you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself, if you really want it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qh	know, you know, how to even go about getting money.
qh	You know, how to get a job or you know, just you know, what, when you get a job, what your responsibility is.
qh	Are you going to blow all that money,
b	Uh huh.
sv	Wow, you've really got responsibilities.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	So really, I think, sometimes there's an advantage,
sv	It makes you know that you can't take anything for granted that when you get something you're lucky to get it, so to speak you know.
h	So, I don't know,
na	I do,
ny	Uh huh,
sd	and I have my own equipment,
sd	and so, I like to cut out my wood, and then tole paint on the items that I cut out.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Oh.
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that is fun.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sv	They are really cute.
ba	that sounds really fun.
sd	and I just got back from that today,
sv	You could make a lot of money from those.
na	apparently,
sd	You would put your sell price
sd	and then they would take twenty percent off of that at the counter.
sd	And so then at the end of the boutique, which usually runs for a week, then they give you what you earned .
sd	So, you have to decide what your price is going to be and then up it twenty percent so you can get what you need out of it.
sd	So if the customers are willing to pay it, then you get a profit.
aa	They are.
b	Uh huh.
sd	that's what I want, is a Shop Smith .
bh	does he?
ba	you're lucky.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ba	how nice.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
qy^g	They just snap it right up,
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, you know, you know last night I was listening to the, ten o'clock news.
sd	And for the first five to seven minutes of a news broadcast all they were talking about was the number of shootings, the number of drug deals that were going on, and crime
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sd	and I just couldn't believe, you know, that
sv	And, because of, the crime
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	it doesn't matter if you live in a small town or if you live in a large city like this.
sd	but, I just think about all the different ways that we have to protect ourselves from,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Plus, I have the special lights on the outside.
ny	Yeah,
ny	yeah,
sd	but, I mean it's just I'm constantly think about keeping us safe and protected, verses,
sd	Two.
sd	One of each.
b	Yeah.
nn	No,
b	Yeah
ba	wow.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	goodness.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my goodness.
b	Uh huh.
ba	goodness.
^2	Someone did,
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's, more of a matter of the steps that you do to keep yourself safe,
b	Uh huh,
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
sd	and I thought, gee whiz, you know, I don't know if he's really doing that or not or if he's the person who lives there.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^2	Half that time,
sv	So scary you think you've got yourself all locked in and safe,
sd	that's the one thing that I like.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
na^m	And loud,
sd	And ease very protective,
aa	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ba	wow, gosh.
fc	Okay.
fc	Okay.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	Well, for a lot of years I, I've pretty much flied without one,
ar	well, the utilities are pretty much,
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes
no	Well, I used to know, fairly close to exactly how many miles I drove, because I was very convenient, I lived, nine tenths of a mile from work.
aa	Yeah,
sd	And I can remember years ago, when school would start,
aa	yeah,
sd	I'm exempt.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've got, two older cars.
sd	And my insurance it was running about four hundred dollars a year.
ar	It's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	they have no fault in Maryland also.
b	Yeah.
nn	Nope.
qw^d	I don't know how familiar you are with Maryland,
sd	especially, the center part of Maryland where I Ninety Five runs through it is really heavily populated.
nn	No.
sd^e	Not a bit.
ny	Yes
sd	right here in Maryland.
aa	Yeah,
sd	So I got an opportunity to transfer back,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	but maybe five percent of the Plano actually were from Texas.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
ba	my God,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Charles D. Gibbons is the guy who runs some ads on light night T V
b	Yes,
ny	Yes,
ny	Yes,
b^m	Yet.
aa	Yeah,
sd	And, I was appalled at how they were paying them.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Well, I've, this company that they bought, they ended up buying a very high payroll.
sd	And, you know, I thought I was making a good wage,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sv	And I don't see that.
sv	and they, I believe that, they have the right to know if you're using a dangerous substance .
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right .
aa	Yes.
sv	Just because you, something can get mixed in the mail,
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
aa	Right,
sd	And, they say that you know, they, they, they've also implemented random testing.
sd	And , it hasn't happened to me in the couple of years that, you know, it's been in progress
sd	but, I fully agree with it
sv	if, if you feel it's an invasion of privacy, you've probably got something you're trying to hide .
b	Yeah.
^2	Or, the quality of their product.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right,
sd	and then and one of the few that they don't have a cure for .
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
ny	Yes,
sd	And I'm down in the central,
b	Right.
sd	We're probably about two, two and a half hours south of him.
na	my!
sd	actually, we got about two inches of rain in about three hours, yesterday.
sd	And it's cooled things down somewhat.
sd	It's getting more humid now,
b	Uh huh .
b	Yeah .
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah,
sd	One of the things I found interesting,
sd	and we have manufacturing plants all around the world including some places where the use of certain drugs that are illegal here are not illegal.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	I mean if, you know, that's the trade off.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sv	Usually with you life in some places.
aa	That's right.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
sd	Well, in Saudi Arabia, you know, using, alcohol and drugs and something like that, you get the death penalty.
sv	So, it's pretty strict over there .
sv(^q)	Well, people tend to take the first amendment out of context. which means you know, I could do anything I want to
^q	and you can't stop me,
b	Yeah.
b^m	Yeah.
h	I don't know.
sd	Well, I'm, thirty one.
b	Yeah,
sd	you know, I've seen a social change,
ny	Yeah.
sd	And, it started, you know, actually going to work in eighty two,
^h	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	but still, you know, after five years, it's like, first kid
sv	and then they're out of the work force for another ten years.
sv	But, I think most of those people are still out .
sv	I think that generation, they're all at home right now
sd	very rarely do I meet anybody whose children are, you know, past that age when they've been away for a few years.
sv	But, it's kind of different.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm an assistant Scout Master
sv	Especially now.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I know two women that,
sd	I'm thirty,
qy^d	Well, I take it since you selected this topic that you have children.
bh	You don't?
ba	My goodness.
sd	so I don't have to worry about child care too much anymore.
aa	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And I think that varies.
sv	you know, it's, once they get to a certain age it's almost more important that it's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who's, you know, really qualified per se.
sv	with a baby, definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency.
b	uh huh,
sd	Well, my experience, I baby sat a lot also when I grew up
sv	And that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot of questions.
sd	because I had three younger brothers and sisters myself
b	Uh huh,
ba	Wow.
aa	I agree with you,
sv	and she met in a safe setting, such as church.
sv	So she was going on those two instincts.
sd	and i , it really shocked me
sd(^q)	And I thought, well she doesn't know me or my children from anything.
sd	And I was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go baby sit for her because I didn't know her then she was reluctant of letting strangers into her house.
sv	So, I mean people are so different.
nd	Well, I did have, my child, in a day care for just a short time when my oldest was about two and a half
sd	and I worked just a part time job
sd	that was a concern with me.
ad	go ahead.
sv	I, I think I went by location for one thing.
sv	I think most people do that.
aa	Right.
sv	You know, I mean, you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north. even if that's the best one in the whole wide world .
sv	So there are just so many considerations.
na	money is always a factor in my life, definitely.
sd	Montessori school would be something that I would have pursued,
sd	and I was very very fortunate in that I didn't have to do that on a full time basis.
b	All right,
sd	And so basically at this point I'm a real walker.
bh	Are you?
sd	I don't do I guess I'll call it that fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips, you know, and keep their arms up.
sd	I don't do that.
sd	I can't neglect that because of the baby either.
sd	well, she was premature,
ba	that's great.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my goodness.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I think that is just wonderful.
sd(^q)	You know. it's not to where I'm just so freed up that I just go, this is wonderful,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	see, now that's really nice.
sd	Because mine's at meetings sometimes
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think that is so wonderful.
ba	I bet.
sd	like when I first started, it, you know, that was the hardest thing was to get ready and get out there.
sd	But now if I haven't done it in a day or two or something, I really notice that I haven't done it in a ...
sd	You know. And I like the time because my kids, sometimes they come with me
sd	I know enough of the people that if anything ever happened I could go to a home around this block area.
sd	So it's not real dangerous,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sv	Well, I think that's great.
sd	I found real quick that wasn't for me.
b	Uh huh .
b	Yeah,
aa	Right ,
sd	So I like that.
b	Uh huh.
sv	They can wait until you get back home.
sv	Well, I think that's great .
b	Okay.
sd	Well, I guess I stand on, probably ten for no, restrictions.
sd	and, I was raised, you know, hunting all the time,
sd	And, it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where, eventually we may not be able to have that right any more.
aa	Yeah,
aa	I think so,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sv	Well, the way things are going.
sd	Well, you know, they introduced some gun control back when I was a teenager, I believe, in terms of, every gun you bought had to be licensed, I believe.
sd	And, you know, that didn't bother me, too much,
na	Well a little bit,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
br	You're supposed to what.
qw	But what are you supposed to do with them.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	we usually you know, collect quite a bit
b	Yeah,
sd	so, we generally don't have those to do.
sd	You know, they charge you, you know,
sv	And I know a lot of people it would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup
sv	they charged you by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a land fill.
sv	that might be a better way to do it.
sv	And then people would know that it was going to cost them money to not sort their trash.
sv(^q)	You know, because then it would make monetary sense to them, you know, to say, hey, you know, if I just spend the time to sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then I don't have to pay for them hauling it off.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah
qw	Where do you live?
bk	okay.
ny	Yes.
aa	It seems like they would be able to.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	now I didn't know that,
b	Yeah.
fc	Okay.
fc	All right,
sd	I'm in Rome, New York.
na^r	Rome, New York,
b^m	Yeah,
sd	but, they're trying to reinstate it
sd	but the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it.
aa	I would agree, with that even more,
b	Right.
no	I don't know,
sv	it's a hard question,
sd	Here in New York it's a lot harder than that,
sd	it takes almost six months to get, handgun permit, in this state.
sd	you have to have, a police investigation,
sd	and I know, because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference
sd	and I know it,
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sd	well, and the thing with Bundy was though he escaped
b	yeah
sd	and did it again
aa	No.
b	Uh huh.
ba	God.
ba	Great.
aa	Surely, there's and end to, the situation.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
^2	Rome, New York,
sd	it's about,
sd	It's more rural,
nd	it use to be use to have a lot of heavy industry,
sd	but it's kind of,
sd	and, now the Air Force is the largest employer in the, area
sd	it, you know, you still have more drug problems and typical, small city type problems,
sd	but I don't know that there's a real,
nn	no
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	I think Penn , Pennsylvania may have just reenacted it
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Sure.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Well, I, yeah,
b	yeah,
ny	yeah,
na	I think,
ny	yeah,
sd	I don't know if they've used it since they've reinstated it
b	Right.
no	Boy, I don't know.
na	or this month, well, there's a couple of changes to the, our health plan
bk	okay.
b	Yes,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
b	and, yeah,
b	yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	that's the thing is how flexible they are for comp time kinds of kinds of things
sd	That's why it hasn't made all that much difference is because with the civil service, that you could take your vacation in increments of one hour
sd	and, but, there wasn't, anything as far as comp time,
sv	whereas, here things are free enough that, the actual vacation time per year probably isn't that much different,
aa	Yeah.
sd	my assumption is that, that will not include my doctor since, he keeps real busy without having to,
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, and I think in the, in the much bigger picture than, to some extent hospitals and doctors have some, fixed amount
sv	and the added costs get passed on to you,
sv	my, one of the phrases I use is that it's moving towards, private socialized medicine. That, in terms of the negatives of always heard in terms of socialized medicine, you have no choice on who you go to for a doctor and things like that, where it's the government that decides,
aa	Yeah,
h	but, I, I don't know,
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
sd	Lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bh	they did?
qw	How did, How did they get involved in that?
b	Uh huh.
ba	how fun.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh,
qw	And, who do you have her, or him, take it from?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
br	Pardon me?
b	Uh huh.
sd	So I wasn't sure when to start her.
b	Uh huh .
b	Yeah.
aa	Uh huh,
sd	It was something easily forgotten.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Well, as a piano teacher, do you have any feelings for kids who come from a Suzuki method,
qw^d	I was wondering how,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it be more on a voluntary basis as opposed to, mandatory.
b	Yeah.
sv	anything shouldn't be mandatory, other than, I guess, like, when you come to paying taxes or something like that.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Uh huh.
sv	And I think, us being taxpayers, we pay for, people that's in jail or in trouble anyway.
sv	So they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas .
aa	And I agree wholeheartedly.
b^m	Yeah.
aa	because like you say, is a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors
qh	so why have someone in jail for a year or two for a misdemeanor.
sv	and then when they get out, they,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	it's very difficult
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	see my father is ninety two
sd	but you know whenever something happens to one of them then, I don't know what I'll do up there.
sd	I just know too many horror stories about nursing homes
sd	They're in Missouri
sv	And, it's tragic that, you know, when people live so long that they, really don't have a place to go.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
sd	So, I mean, he's from that old depression era
sd	I would imagine that if something happens, I'll move one of them or bot , you know, in with me.
sd	But I know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is
sd	But I just don't know how much you can see when you go for a,
sv	I think you just have to drop in all unexpectedly a lot.
sv	And so many people when they put people in the nurses home, they never see them.
sv	They never go to see them.
sd	I've talked to many, owners of places and say that nobody even,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	I do too.
sd	because I know Governor Richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing homes, regulation in Texas
b	Right.
b	Oh.
aa	It is a tough decision
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	I would hope we could do that, and then go from there.
sv	We've covered a little bit
fc	Have a good,
fc	Have a good lif ,
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sv	People that can really influence the government have all the money to throw.
aa	No.
b	Well, yeah.
sd	we live here also,
sv	and that it's mostly sales tax,
sd	I've lived in Texas most of my life.
sd	And we're like .
sd	So, I mean, that was kind of different
sd	so I then, have also done tax returns in the past for other people when I worked for an accounting firm.
sv	And, you know, it is kind of sad to see how the people that have the resources to hire somebody and have the money to spend to put there money in places, they don't have to pay taxes.
sv	Or to buy something that loses money so that they can offset the income that they get or whatever.
sd	So, you know, I can understand why the rich people don't want to pay, you know, a large percent
sv	because, you know, that's not really fair, either.
sv	it's kind of depressing sometimes, I think.
b	Yeah.
aa	Well, yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ng	They must have enough other stuff because the way the oil has been the last few years, that really has not been, the industry that is bringing in the money for the taxes, I wouldn't think.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
sv	why people decided to expect certain services,
sv	Then, they don't really think they should pay for them, maybe.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
fc^t	I need, I've never initiated one of these phone calls.
fc	Oh.
fc	Okay,
fc	Bye bye.
qy	So, do you have the long,
qy	Do do you do your own gardening?
b	Do you.
sd	See I got mine in,
b	Yeah.
sd	it's pretty hot down here during the Summer,
sd	but, you know, we don't do too much during the Summer, as far as tomatoes and stuff, like that.
ny	Yeah.
sd	But then I have to wait for my,
sd	as soon as we're, sure we're not going to have another freeze, go ahead finish it.
aa	Yeah.
sd	but every once in a while, we get a freeze around the middle of April,
sd	and it's pretty tough.
nn	No.
sd	I'm only forty years old.
sd	I really enjoy it,
sd	and I, burned my grass off here in the last couple of days getting ready to start to the Spring season, and see if I can grow me another nice lawn,
sd	I usually have a pretty nice lawn,
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
sd	We're going through that,
sd	but what I did with my garden, is I have a two by six frame that's five by ten.
sd	and then I put, like, a black plastic,
sd	and I put that down,
sd	so I waste it up and down there a couple of times,
sd	and it's pretty nice.
sd	Especially during the Summer, it keeps everything wet, instead of wilting.
b	Oh.
qy^d	you have a spring,
ba	how nice.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's, that's pretty nice.
qy^g	But you actually enjoy it,
bh	Do you?
sv	Get out there on your hands and knees, and crawl around.
ba	I can imagine.
qy	With the worms?
b^m	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
sd	but, sometimes I can't manage.
b	Yeah.
nn	No,
nn	No.
bh	Really.
sd	I've never eaten dandelions
sd	but I've never tried any dandelions just to eat.
b	Yeah.
aa	All right.
b	Yeah.
aa	I'll try that.
aa	I sure will .
b	Oh.
ba	Yow.
bf	So you all are into, so you all are into the lawn, big time,
b^m	Yeah,
sd	then I have a pretty nice backyard,
sd	and you know, I've got enough room to throw horseshoes. You know, couple of other ,
aa	No,
aa	Yeah.
sd	I have the room outside I need,
aa	No.
sd	Rolly Polly bugs.
sd	They look like they've got,
ny	Yeah.
nn	No.
nn	no.
sd	I don't know what they call them.
sd	I, I don't know.
b	Yeah,
aa	No.
sd	and these are just,
nn	No.
nn	No.
sd	They're like a, water bug, of sorts,
ny	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
sd	When you touch them, they roll up.
sd	But, I'm plagued with those.
sv	You know, I think it's a big problem because we're in more of a tempered zone.
b	You know.
sv	And, you, spray in one part of your lawn,
sv	So you got to, spray your whole yard,
sv	and your, your neighbor gets them,
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	They sure are, pretty,
sd	I like them ,
b	yeah.
sd	and they bloom in, you know, late June, mid, July.
aa	Yeah,
sd	they're nice and green, you know,
sd	They come up real pretty, every year, no problem.
qy	Is it still pretty cool up there?
qy	Well, do you all have a,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and I still have the old standby crabgrass here and there,
ny	Yeah.
qy^g	Cooking and food,
qo	What do you like to cook?
b	Uh huh.
ba	dear.
ar	probably not.
sd	And, it is wonderful.
sd	and it looks like it is a wheat bread.
sd	and, you know, it is just regular
sd	and you let it rise
sd	and they are so easy to do.
sd	seems like every time that we have a dinner party, or that we are going some place where everybody is suppose to bring something and they have had my rolls before. They always ask me to, bring those rolls .
nn	No
ba	how funny.
sd	Well, see I have always used celery, I mean, I have used celery before.
sd	But I never used the celery seed in it.
qw	Well, what else do you put in it besides the celery seed.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	See, I have never put bell pepper in tuna fish either.
bh	Isn't that funny?
sd	The standard old tuna fish.
b	Uh huh.
bh	But isn't that interesting?
sd	I will have to try that.
sd	Sometimes I do
sd	And sometimes, if I am using, like, regular mayonnaise, to spice it up a little bit I will use a little bit of mustard with it.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
sv	But enough to, make it have a little bit more flavor.
sd	I like, to barbecue baby back ribs.
sd	and you, just cook them very, very slowly in the oven.
sv	And it is not hard to cook, like some meals are.
sv	And of course, it is messy to eat.
sd	And, I make lasagna from scratch
sd	and so, sometimes, I am requested to make that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Then, I have a wonderful recipe for strawberry pie.
ny	uh huh.
sd	But then you use this sort of,
sd	and so, it is sort of like in a way. using cheese cake,
nn	no,
qy^g	Michael Jordan's on Chicago Bulls isn't he.
qy	did he get hurt last night
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
nn	No,
ny^m	Yeah.
aa	Sure is.
b	yeah.
sv	They're consistent.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
na	his back is bad all the time now, I think.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ng	Not much.
b^m	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	I figured,
aa	Yeah.
sd	Well, it's, I was looking in the paper for something on it
b	Uh huh.
b^m	Six foot,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
aa	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd^r	It doesn't say,
sd	and, I guess they have, they, they, have a lottery on it.
sd	It must not be according to how they did during the year.
b	Uh uh.
b	Uh huh.
no	I don't know,
sd	Utah, Portland, Boston and Detroit.
b	Okay.
sv	I think Boston will win.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
nn	no,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Sesame seeds and bread crumbs.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Right,
ny	yeah,
na	there's a restaurant called String Bean on Spring Valley and Central.
sd	I like that,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right,
sd	So, I do not really like, you know, chili places or, what is it, Judge Roy Bean's,
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
sd	it was great.
qh	You know.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	and, then he tried to made grapefruit citron one time.
sd	It's, supposed to be candy.
sd	And, it did not turn out very well,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	Well, you have to put eggs and everything, don't you.
b^m	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Mostly, I just cook for myself.
b	Uh huh.
b^m	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
aa	Uh huh.
aa	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Fill them up
aa	Yeah.
b	yeah .
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
na	just barely.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
aa	just, yeah,
bh	Really? .
ba	Wowie!
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Well, I think it is, basically the same way.
sv	Because, the whole thing that was bad about Vietnam, it was no different from Iraq.
b^m	Yeah.
aa	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sv	I mean back then it was not commonly known that saccharin was bad for you and all these other things that people that people know about themselves now.
b	Uh huh .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	I work for a government contractor.
sd	So at least some of the guys I work with rather are veterans.
na	And, from Vietnam.
sd	And, I have not talked to any of them that were not, you know, glad that they went or rather thought that the reason they went was a good one.
sd	You know, most of them are very strongly that the reason for America to be there was a good one.
sd	They just felt that the way America backed them up was not at all right.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Because the Congress would not approve, you know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	right,
fc	Yes.
fc	No,
fc	Yeah,
fc	pretty much,
fc	Yeah.
fc	little bit cooler, like eighty nine.
fc	Yeah.
fc	Okay.
fc^m	Bye bye.
sv	I don't think they should be forced,
b	Yeah,
aa	I think so, too.
b	Yeah.
aa	Your right,
aa	Right,
b	Yeah.
aa	I do, too.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah .
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sd	and they clean it up.
sd	And keep it clean.
b	Oh.
ny	Yeah,
bk^m	New York.
ba	gosh.
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ba	Golly.
bh	Are you serious? .
ba	my God,
b	Yeah.
ba	Lord.
ba	Well, that's good.
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
ny	yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	So it's real neat.
sd	it's like I say,
sv	and you know, if you can do any a little bit, it helps,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	Gosh.
sv	that's a lot of kids, though.
sv	well, still you know, that's a good chunk of kids.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's great.
ba	That's great.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Oh.
sd	I couldn't either.
aa	Right,
aa	Yeah.
sd	I wish I could do something like that,
b	Right,
na	That's right .
fc	You, too,
fc	Yeah.
fc	Good,
fc	Thanks.
fc	Bye .
sd	I like it.
nn	Well, no.
qy	are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that? .
qy	Well, have you, do you, are you involved in any other, metric type things like ...
sv	I think it's interesting you know, when yo , you go out there
sv	Well, now that one's fairly easy, because that's probably slightly under half an inch.
aa	Yeah.
qy	th , have you noticed that a lot of ...
aa	Yes.
sd	like fifths of whiskey I thought was always kind of strange.
qh	What's a fifth of whiskey? .
sv	It was a marketing ploy.
b	Yeah.
sv	I find that interesting.
sv	and, I think it's kind of generational.
aa	Yeah.
sv	It's like a mill, you know.
qh	And well, what's a mill
b	Yeah.
qy	Don't you find that interesting? that that they're doing that, in any field,
bk	okay.
bf	The bolts were Eng , were, were English then.
ba	Now that's strange.
b	Yeah.
sv	or you measu , or you got your calipers there
aa	No.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy^g	You get you a pair of metric pliers, right ?
qy^d	And you beat on it
sv	I don't think so.
sv	I don't think they'd ever,
b	Yeah.
sd	I was trying to figure up gold content on something.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I mean, and then there's a metric ton
ny	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
no	I don't know.
aa	That's right.
aa	Yes.
aa	Yeah.
bf	So you've got thousands of dollars or so.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah.
sv(^q)	But you, when you, when you simply drilling a hole, I mean, a real simple thing, like gee,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
t3	I'm on the other line Karen.
b^m	Okay.
sv	And, what to do about it I guess is the big thing.
sd	I'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my wife teaches school here in Plano.
sd	And, I know that, the results that they get out of the system sometime is certainly not , you know, up to what the effort they put into it, you know,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sv	And, if, no matter what they do in the classroom, if they go home at night and, you know, it's all totally undone,
sd	the thing that Karen, my wife, has run into so often is that you run into a group of kids that are going to succeed no matter what, no matter how bad their teachers are, no matter what a lousy system they're in, or anything else,
sd	these people somehow manage to, you know, push on through and are successful.
sv	It's, unfortunately probably maybe twenty five or thirty percent of them do that.
sv	Well, that would be at the absolute most.
sv	And, you know, those that, you know, come out, you know, fall out of the system, that are real trouble,
qy^d	I wonder whether that's just a part of the system, you know,
sv	you know, in a democracy where, you know, people have kind of, a freedom to sort of do what they want, you know, there's an inefficiency there,
sv	and you've got to let you know, those,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	from the minute that you walk in until, yo , until you leave, your competing against somebody else
sv	there is a personality type I believe that is really noncompetitive.
sv(^q)	and when they get into a real competitive system they just say, well, what the heck, and, tend not to, you know, do too awful well .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I would think so,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	and unfortunately, you know, there's and old joke about, you know,
sd(^q)	I know when I went to school, my attitude was kind of one of, you know, these people are, you know, taking a tremendous amount of my time, you know,
^q	and I've got better things to be doing than sitting here listening to this stuff over and over again.
sv	I guess today some how or other there would be a program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing,
sv	most teachers after they have taught for a very long, especially at the lower grades can spot a problem almost immediately.
sd	And, it's kind of these intervention programs.
sv	and then it gets political.
ba	But, boy.
aa	Uh huh,
b	yeah.
sv	Well, you know, the radical programs in some cases are just totally unacceptable.
sv	or they're never going to get anywhere.
sv(^q)	I'm sure that if you, you know, ran on a platform of, you know, we're going to find the kids that are having trouble at home and we're going to take them out of the home.
b	Yeah,
sv	but unfortunately it's something like that, in lieu of that, you know, is the intervention programs in school where these kids are spotted fairly early on,
sd	and, you know, well that's get to be a problem in Texas, you know, because different school systems have got more or less money to take care of that sort of thing,
sd	you got counselors and all that.
sv	or they don't care.
ba	True.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah
qy^d	I don't know if you've ever had too much to do with, especially Asian, Japanese families coming,
sd	engineering types, people who have come from Japan,
sd	and they put their kids in the U S schools
sd	You know, not so much at what the schools are teaching, but what they let the kids get away with.
sd	they're quite upset about the disruptive influence of school.
sd	And in Japan they would be, you know.
sv	But, here again, you get back into a political thing, where,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
bk	okay.
b	Yeah.
aa	Uh huh,
sd	I graduated from Texas Tech, more than two years ago, I guarantee,
sd	and, you know, I kind of look back at it sometimes,
b	Uh huh.
ad^t	Why don't you go ahead and start off .
aa	I agree, although, we're in that situation right now.
sd	We have an eighty seven year old mother in law living with me right now
sd	and because of her circumstances she can no longer live independently.
sd	and we have several young children
sd	and they about drive her crazy.
sd	Well, you know, we've struggled a lot with it because, again, most of the nursing homes I've been in are very depressing to me.
sd	And she's still alert enough that I think she would really know that we were putting her there
sd	and I think she would really resent it,
sd	But, on the other hand, I see my wife with,
sd	and her trying to struggle because her mother really cannot take care of herself.
sv	And so the drain on the family.
sd(^q)	And when the kids have kids come, you know, she's always saying, you know, why do they have to be here,
sv	So it's a hard situation, either way, I think.
sd	I think that's one of the things we're really wrestling with.
^2	prohibitive.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think if we could send her someplace for the day and she could be around some elderly people and have some activities would be of more interest to her and then in the evening have her return and be with the family.
b	Yeah.
sv	But there's not many of those available right now
sv	and they're very hard to get them into
sd	But they're really not prepared to cope with her because she's somewhat senile.
sd	And so a lot of the activities that they're engaged in, she can't participate in.
sv	But I think it's an issue that, you know,
sv	Because it is a difficult situation
sv	And then I think it depends on their physical ability, too, you know,
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you live at all close to each other?
b^m	Okay.
sv	I like as a growing choi , the choices you have in nursing homes now, whereas you used to have only, you put, you know,
sv	and there was no other choice.
sv	or your daily job or whatever prevented it.
sv	And then if things deteriorate, they can go to a second level which is, you know, like, where they prepare their meals for them
sv	and they still live somewhat independently
sv	And then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level, which is full care, you know, where they're in a wheelchair or where they're in a bed,
sv	and they can't get around
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sd	and the programs,
sd	Like you're saying,
sd	and some of them sponsor different crafts,
sd	or, you know, or someone will transport them to a specific church, even though you know, maybe it's thirty minutes away,
sd	But a lot of these places have churches or have individual transportation.
sv	Because even in the nice ones, and even in the ones where they can live fairly independently, they really don't necessarily like it because they're not in their own home.
sv	So I think those kinds of things, to make it more homelike and to make it more, enjoyable for them. that'd be one thing I'd look for, along with the, health care aspects to make sure you know, that it was clean and that they had good doctors and nurses.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^2	Are overmedicated, too.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Or they have very minimal care
sv	and like you said, the caretakers in some cases are trying to make easy on themselves to the point where they're putting people in bed or overmedicating them so they'll stay in one spot and not do anything.
sv	That certainly would be something to watch for.
b	Yeah.
aa	yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sv	Well, like there are other communities, too, that aren't necessarily a nursing home.
sd	and it was, supplemented,
sd	they had, and they had people who came in who, supervised, all these houses,
sd	And they had a supervisory,
sd	and someone, could come to their house.
sd	and they always cooked,
sd	They had their own possessions still in there, you know, some of them.
sd	And they could make their own breakfast if they wanted to, and their own dinner,
sd	They had people who did the yard,
sd	And it was really a nice compromise, especially, because she felt like she was still living in her own house.
sd	And she still had her own couch, and her own bed,
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	she felt that way, too,
sd	it was a pilot program I think, where she lived,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's good.
sv	An even if it's just a little bit.
b	Yeah.
bf	So, it's more like living in a big house where it's your turn to set the table, like you're saying, or whatever instead of being waited on hand and foot all the time.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yes,
sv	Like you're saying with Alzheimer's and stuff, they're going to be some people who have to be there whether they want to or not,
sv	and that's when it's important to really check out the medical aspects of it, when you're in something like that, that they'll get the kind of medical care or they need, without overdoing it. Without doing something you know, to keep, like you're saying, to keep them still to make the staff happy.
sd	I am in Plano.
bh	Is that right?
bk	okay.
qy	You mean you use credit cards?
qy^d	I bet you used them all up over Christmas.
sv	And then your are in debt.
ba	I understand that.
nd	Well, it kind of comes and goes,
sd	Once a year, I get a free airplane ride that way.
sd	So, as long as you pay it off every month, it doesn't cost you anything.
ny	Yeah.
ny^r	Yeah.
sd	If I don't then it gets expensive .
ad	Well you shouldn't do that.
sv	you never get out of the hole that way.
qy^g	Kind of like the federal government right?
sv	Can't never get out of debt.
nn	No.
sd	Just the people who don't need credit get the four and a half percent.
sv	thou who doesn't need credit, gets cheap credit.
aa	Well, I think so
aa	That's right.
sv	You have got to use everything you have got just to stay where you are at.
qy	do you have any, credit union where you work or anything like that?
qy	Do they have a Mastercard or VISA card?
qy^d	You have got that one.
bk	Oh.
sd	I do a lot of work down in Waco,
sd	I sell metal fabricating equipment and tooling.
sd	Tyme and Mercury and Tempco and all those people down there.
qy^h	Davis Iron?
ny^m	Yeah,
qy	are you in the south part of town now?
bk	yeah.
qy	You know Do you know Parker Machine Tool down there.
qy^d	Bobby Parker and,
sd	There is a place in Hewett, called,
sd	They make, humidifiers and filters for air filtration stuff for hospitals, homes, something like that.
ny	yeah.
b	really.
sd	I will have to stop in there.
sd	He is working on his Master's.
sd	That is about the last time I have been through Marlin and Mart .
sv	There is always a state trooper down there.
sv	Between Mart and Marlin, they will nail you if you go over sixty miles an hour.
b	Uh huh.
na	Well, the one I think is interesting is the Los Angeles police chief who says he won't resign.
sv	I think what's interesting is that, the political activists, Jesse Jackson and a lot of other people went out there and are demonstrating.
qy	Well, do you but do you think Gates should resign?
qy	well, speaking of that kind of issue, have you kept up with John Wiley Price?
qo	What do you think of him?
sv	He's an interesting person.
sv	and, the, the, at those meetings he really comes quite well prepared and is well informed and is a hard worker and is really quite agreeable,
sv	well, he's really just trying to make a political statement.
aa	I agree with you
sv	it was the strangest,
sd	I guess I am disappointed with Dallas in that, the fourteen one, it,
ny	Yeah.
sv	and I think Dallas is doing itself a disservice.
aa	Yeah,
sv	and it all seems, you know, like everybody's trying to one upmanship on everybody else
fc	It was good talking to you.
fc	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	but I have an aunt who lived on her own until she was well in her nineties
sd	and then she got sick
sd	and my parents went to visit her
sd	and so they gave her drugs to keep her asleep.
sv	Nice sedative state.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	To be violent.
qr	Was this in a big town or a little town?
bh	really?
sv	Because it seems like the small town nursing homes, there's a lot more personal attention.
aa	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
b	Okay,
b	Uh huh.
sv	well, I guess it would be like your generation compared to my generation.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes, I agree with,
b	Uh huh.
qy	Well, Well, do you think that that maybe,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	my gosh, just a baby.
ba	my gosh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	like I think, well, in the morals and values of like my generation for most people are totally different from the morals and values of like per se your generation.
aa	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
no	I don't know, because while I'm up here at school, I don't watch hardly any T V.
nn	No,
sd	even though there's a few up here, we call them couch potatoes,
sd	and there isn't really a lot of T V watching.
nd	They're either hitting the books or something else,
sd	but I can't say that there's really that many people that like sit in front of the T V all day.
aa	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
nd	Well, like my younger brothers and sisters at home.
sd	even now when I go home for the Summer, she makes us go outside,
sd	and if it was up to her, we wouldn't have one.
qo	What about in our work ethics?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
fc^m	It was nice talking to you too.
nn	No.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I can't even play miniature golf well.
sv	Well, there are just some things that we're good at and other things that we're not,
sd	And he was really, enthusiastic about keeping up with the tournaments.
aa	yeah,
sd	and did some, you know, instructions at the country club for a while.
sd	I am not really deeply involved in following any of the sports.
sd	But golf was one that I developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers,
b	Uh huh.
sd	And, I know that my husband,
sd	And he thought he was spectacular.
sd	Any time they both played, why, he was just real excited when Tom was, you know, shown on the television,
sd	We both followed Lee Trevino into the Seniors.
aa	He is.
sv	He is a character not just a golfer,
sv	but he's quite a character.
sv	And there are some really, really wonderful people in the game of golf who do give wonderful role models.
sv	And I think it's critical to have a good role model in any sports.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I myself, really have not seen a whole lot of point to the game of golf.
sv	And I know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole,
aa	I know.
b	Uh huh,
b	yeah.
sv	so he wasn't bad.
sv	He was pretty good,
sv	But it is a good healthy, wholesome lifestyle,
sv	But I think that that is one of the sports that's a good healthy way to move into maturity safely.
aa	Uh huh,
sv	And a lot of elderly people don't even take up golf until they're, you know, in their later years.
aa	That's right,
b	Yeah,
sv	But it's also something that husband and wife can participate in
sv	or, you can both enjoy the same sport and participate in separate circles.
sv	You know, you can go to the country club together.
ba	You bet,
aa	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
sd	He's replaced almost as many clubs as he has balls.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
ny	Uh huh.
sv	Well, one thing that is a drawback about it, I think, is the cost.
sv	Membership in the clubs is expensive,
aa	That's right.
aa	That's right,
aa	It can get very expensive,
sd	And they don't give those sessions away.
sd	As a matter of fact a friend of mine asked me if I thought I'd be interested in golf.
sd(^q)	And he said, well, fine,
^q	If you do, then we can go golf together.
ba	whoa,
sv	And you really begin to develop an interest in it.
sd	You know, I'm always the one that got hit by the bat in baseball, and, hu , hung my fingernails in the net in volleyball.
sv	It doesn't appear to be .
sd	The one thing that is also detrimental as far I'm concerned, my skin is very fair
sd	so I'm going to have to golf in the evening
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	So am I.
ny	Yes,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qy^m	Two?
qo@	what do you have? Five and four.
sd	I have two daughters.
sd	My oldest is, four
b	Two girls.
aa	Yes.
sd	And, she got pregnant
sd	And, we made that decision
sd	And so, you know, at work a lot of people are, you know,
sd	I only have one other person I know in my group here that works where the wife stays home,
sv	But everybody else works
b	Right.
sd	That's how it is at our house when you're on the phone.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
qy^d	With all the yard work and things like that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Like last Saturday we went, had some errands to run
sd	And they had a blast running around the Farmers Market looking at all the, you know, the food and tasting all the free samples they were giving out.
sd	and they liked that.
sd	and they had all kinds of pigs and horses and goats and sheep and everything, you know, all out in the, in this schoolyard there.
sd	and for them that's wonderful, you know.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	and a mother isn't an important important thing as having a career
sv	and that should be first and, and children second.
aa	No.
qy^d	at this point.
sv	It's not to say that some day you won't go back to work.
sd	So she would just substitute once or twice a week, you know, just for that little extra money when we were in school.
sd	But my, youngest sister's at B Y U now,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	And a lot of them decide just not to have children.
sv	it's amazing, they either have one or none.
sd	and the one person I know that has one, they feel guilty.
sd	and, and they don't want to have anymore children because she doesn't think she could be a mother at home.
b	Uh huh.
sd	she works at home some, though.
sd	The place she worked with before, worked out an arrangement with her where she can work at home, part time,
sd	and so, it's kind of a seasonal thing.
sd	but the rest of the time she's free.
aa	Right,
sv	when you adjust your income for what you put out for day care, you know, you're only making like five.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	I had the unpleasant experience of going through several schools that were very specialized.
ba	That's wonderful.
sd	being an engineer now, I believe in it even more strongly than I did before.
sd	Well, thus far it's working to my advantage.
sd	And I have the ability to listen to them and then translate that into something that nonengineers can understand.
nd	Well, it's, a lot of fun, at the moment.
sd	Even at that, I have a son, who's only nine at the moment.
aa	Yes,
aa	I agree.
sd	the typical land grant university,
sd	Anyway, while it has both engineering and liberal arts, the engineering students tend to cluster together.
sd	You know, they're in classes together, even when they're outside of the engineering department.
sd	And they don't learn the communications,
sv	And it's, that's not even true in our colleges.
b	Right.
sd	Yes, I re , I remember that experience
sd	that and, extra music classes.
sv	Well, that will continue to grow even as you go beyond graduate school.
qy	have you gone straight through?
aa	That's true.
co	Well, let me encourage you to stop and experience life along the way.
sd	I first enrolled in college in nineteen sixty six.
sd	six years, and a war later, I got an undergraduate degree.
aa	yes.
sv	it certainly makes acceptance of different ideas a lot easier.
sv	Well, vicarious learning is a wonderful thing.
sv	It certainly means that we don't have to experience everything,
sd	My wife, as I may have mentioned, just finished a doctorate a couple of years ago.
sd	and she pursued her education along the lines that I did with lots of break in between.
sd	And she feels reasonably comfortable teaching now.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	they even hate to give out unemployment at the end of tax season because you know, they're fairly, even though they're a large scale company, they're very, the offices, the individual offices are very small
sd	and now I work for the Framingham school system because I'm a teacher.
sd	And, we have much better benefits, you know, in the system.
sd	We have a good pension plan.
aa	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh!
aa	Right.
sd	My father's retired from the town of Framingham
sd	and he said that they haven't gotten a cost of living raise in over five years.
sd	And he said that's the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired
sv	and it's, hopefully will go through.
sd	But, you know, I think the schools are at, where the schools isn't just the school system and not just the teachers.
sd	They took in the whole town plus all you know,
na	we have the teachers union which helps out a lot,
sd	but the town of Framingham pays the benefits
sd	and where it's a very large town,
sd	where it's extremely large, they were able to offer a little bit more which was really great because we don't have to pay a mayor .
aa	Right,
sd	So it works out good because we reap the benefits of it
sd	but as far as shopping for a job, I'd rather shop for the benefits than the salary.
b	Right .
b	Right .
ng	Not really .
sd	I haven't read too many.
b	Yeah.
sd	if they had it, I don't even know that I'd probably read it even if it was at the library though.
sd	I just, you know, I'm just not really interested in reading about other people's lives to that degree.
sd	You know, unless maybe they lived a long, long time ago.
b	Yeah.
sd	And that was excellent.
ny	yeah.
sd	And I've been looking for, you know, the other half of it and read the,
sd	, and that was actually a couple of years ago,
sd	I love to read.
sv	And you have so many out there that you know, you never get a chance to read.
sd	and that, even when I read it now, it still makes me cry, the ending of it.
sd	I'd read some Dickens before,
sv	something's excellent about them, whether it's the way they were written or whether it was the material you know, that was written about.
sd	And, she just would get them real cheap and stuff and send them over.
sd	And she knows so much more of them than I do,
b	You know.
sv	probably you read a book review or something.
sv	A review on it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, what I do is I usually have two books at one time.
sd	but others, eh , I really do have to work at them.
sd	But to me it's worthwhile in the end.
sd	just light reading that are,
sd	That's it,
b	Yeah.
sv	So, it's basically mindless.
sv	But they give you everything else.
sv	And the television that we see nowadays seems like it's, it's, it doesn't even have some of the underlying, things to it, you know, that maybe the old movies and things had, you know, the underlying themes and stuff that maybe you had to kind of figure out.
sv	Or, you know, like with Hitchcock or something where you're, you're either expecting something or w ,
aa	No.
aa	Yeah.
sv	you're, you're taking words and developing a picture in your mind.
sv	So, I mean, it's excellent.
sd	I'm, we haven't got children yet,
sv	I mean, even if you haven't got a f , a human friend around, you can pick up a book and, be with somebody, basically.
fc	I gathered you might be a teacher.
fc	Oh.
fc	Yeah.
fc	Okay.
fc	Okay.
fc	Take care.
fp^m	Good morning.
aa	Yeah,
b	uh huh
b	Yeah.
sd	It don't matter what their excesses were,
sd	We didn't seem to be going in and taking anything out of the country other than just it's labor,
sd	because everything that T I did anyway we shipped in
sd	I didn't feel that we really exploiting them any.
aa	No,
sv	and, of course, we kind of concentrate on ,
sd	the only thing that they had a great abundance of was, you know, human beings
aa	Yeah,
sv	you know, it's the almost stereotype, you know,
fe	but boy
sd(^q)	And I saw incidences in the hotel where I just wanted to go over and crawl in the corner and say, my God
^q	But there are
sd	matter of fact if anything, she's worse.
sd	But, it just, there's little enclaves down there where, you know, Americans have a lot of influence
qy	Well, you were in Peru?
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh .
bk	okay
qy	Well, are they, is Peace Corps still active down in there?
b	Uh huh.
qy	has those influences lasted
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
bf	Well, that was kind of the aim wasn't it, to get it started and then have it, taken up by the,
sd	I had wondered sometimes,
b	Uh huh .
b	Oh.
fp	Hi.
fp	I'm Tina.
sd	I live in Garland, Texas.
sd	my lands, you're the farthest person I've ever talked to.
ny	Yeah.
ng	My husband does.
b	Yeah.
b	I see,
aa	Yeah,
b	Okay.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	really.
aa	Yeah,
sd	and up there, of course they ate a lot of sea food, and that kind of thing,
sv	and down here, sea food is pretty expensive, because, you have to ship it a long way to get it .
aa	Right,
sd	and, up there there was no place that we went tasted like real Mexican food to me.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	and, down here, we eat a lot more fried foods, I think.
sd	Like chicken fried steak, is a real big thing.
sd	Up there, it was hardly ever heard of
sd	and up there hardly anyone drank ice tea .
bh	Really?
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah.
sd	and a lot of the times when we get together, well everybody will bring a Mexican dish
aa	Uh huh.
bh	really.
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
na	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That probably makes it easier,
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
sd	But, they like, spaghetti.
sd	You know, that's one meal, I can fix
sd	and the whole family eats.
aa	Yeah,
sv	and, they are real easy to cook
sd	and my girls don't like beef,
h	I guess,
sv	but it takes more chewing .
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
sd	My husband and I eat more beef than we should,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	We have a real tiny little house,
sd	But, we do get together for fellowships at our church,
sd	and, my husband and I do a lot of the planning in that.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah
sd	But it's the only time I can remember that,
sd	And we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers
ng	Well, not really,
sd	we were not sure who didn't show up with the food .
aa	Yes.
b	Right.
aa	Right.
b	I know it.
sd	It sounds like you're here in Dallas.
b	Oh.
sd	and we're waiting on my sister.
t3	Cara, hold on just a second
fc	I think it probably has been.
fc	So, I've enjoyed talking to you.
fc	Thank you.
fc	Bye bye.
nd	Well, it was favorable.
sv	It got over so fast,
sd	Well, it just came out, I guess, yesterday.
sv	And so it seems like there's, you know, always some body digging things like that.
sv	So, we were so, fast to get over the Vietnam, whatever the Vietnam syndrome is, that now we've tied ourselves up there in the Middle East for a long period of time.
b	Yeah.
sv	With that much support, you would have just penalized any nation that broke the embargo,
aa	We are.
aa	Right.
aa	And we're still, I, I you're absolutely right,
sv	be interesting to keep watching I guess,
sv	Not very much in our colleges,
sv	with our school systems in such disarray, I don't know, it doesn't look terribly hopeful.
sv	Well, you can at least, give them the awareness of the different cultures and, you know, at least, you know, let them know that, that other people do things differently than, than maybe in their own neighborhood.
sv	and when, when those people are around
sv	So, But it's something you know, as I said won't go away,
sv	so it will be a good topic for me in the class for along time .
sv	Well, I would just think if Bush was so successful in lining up the correlation to prosecute a war, then he should be equally successful in getting that same correlation to push the United Nations to, somehow persuade those nations to give the Kurds a homeland
sv	Well, that's the same thing,
sv	that becomes a different matter simply because your dealing with Israel
sv	that Shamir can't retain his leadership if he backs down the slightest bit
sv	or at least we thought they were.
sv	Well, I wish we could stay out of it,
sv	But I'm not for sure that we're not destined, at least for the foreseeable future, as long as we can keep our own head above water, to be the world leader.
sd	And I wouldn't have necessarily fought for the Kuwaitis,
b	Huh uh.
aa	Yeah.
sv	But, it's just, for those who may have wanted to travel in that part of the world that are up in the age I am, it's going to eliminate that for awhile.
sv	I think it's going to be too dangerous to be any place in there.
bh	did you?
aa	Yes.
aa	Yeah.
b	It hasn't .
sd	I've been to north Africa a lot but not,
b	Right.
b	Sure. For this little project they're doing.
fc	In fact, I just talked to the director awhile ago,
fc	Thank you.
fc	Bye bye.
ba	There you go .
qy	have you ever read the book NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR?
bk	Okay,
sv	and you could picture it as being Russia versus the U S during the whole time
sd	and what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them because the people there could realize that they were the same as themselves, you know,
sv	And you didn't want that to happen.
sd	and then you have the people inhabiting the country
sd	And these people are the same as you are.
sv	And what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country, supposedly U S or Russia attacks a country, it's not going to be within the borders of the U S or Russia itself.
sv(^q)	You know. It's like you're not going to go in there and say no,
b	Right.
sv	You know, and now you know, they're saying were I guess, other leaders were still crazier about it, you know,
sd	And the U S has.
sd	like they were saying they go, you know,
sv	The U S S R wouldn't do it. Because they got too much at stake.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, my point of view to that is, is that I mean the attack would have been so complete on Iraq if they had.
sv	that would have meant a total attack of the Iraq country within, you know, three hours of when the weapon was shot.
aa	Right.
sv	I mean, if he were to use that, he might as well commit suicide because he's going to be captured and, you know.
sv(^q)	But the U. S. also makes a lot of, you know, treaties with other people like saying, okay,
^q	We'll overthrow you,
aa	, no.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sv	like like they, like the U. S. goes and goes into Panama
sv	because what happens is,
sv	and, you know, life ends there
b	You know.
nn	No,
sv	A lot of like dancers and stuff like that.
sd	They said that they wouldn't leave Russia unless Russia told them that they couldn't travel anymore and compete.
sv	It's just that, you know, they won't let you get out
b	So, well,
fc	Nice talking to you.
fc^m	Bye bye.
fp	Hi, Judy.
sv^t	We got a great topic .
na^t	I guess we might as well .
b^m	Okay.
t1	What changes,
b	Yeah.
sv^m	well, yeah.
aa	Right.
sv	not many.
sd	I did work in government.
sd	And before that I worked in a bank for eight years.
sd	And now I'm retired.
aa	That's right.
qw	Which do you work in, excuse me?
b^m	A government.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qy^d	In teaching.
sv	But not at the college level.
sd	We live in a college town
sd	And there are woman there
ar	Well, they did have one woman dean
ng	None of the above .
aa	I think they're not selected,
sd	And, of course, at this university,
sv	And that's where the high pay is.
sv	well, I think there are more than there used to be.
sv	But they may not go into teaching,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh .
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I met one one day that, had just joined the faculty in agricultural engineering
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I don't know.
aa	That could be.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	Oh.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know one, gal
sd	And then they had a child
ny	Uh huh.
sd	She was a little perturbed about it.
na	At one time.
sd	she's moved away. I don't know how it is now
b	Uh huh.
sd(^q)	Because her statement was, I told him let's face it
sv	She wouldn't have be,
sv	it wouldn't have been a doubter .
aa	Huh uh.
aa	That's right .
sv	I think maybe more men would like to be if they weren't put down so badly .
aa	Huh uh.
aa	No,
qo	How do you feel your career has gone?
bh	You don't.

fc^m	Bye Bye.
sd	Well, I, just had a Christmas Around The World party the other night and had some hors d'oeuvres.
sd	And I fixed, a crab meat spread that is real good and real easy.
sd	it's like, eight ounces of cream cheese softened,
ad	and you mix it with one tablespoon onion juice and one tablespoon lemon juice, one tablespoon worcester sauce and mix it and spread it out onto a plate.
ny	Uh huh.
ad	And then you take and, cover that with drained crab meat mixed with one of the small bottles of chili sauce and spread it over the top and spread it on Triscuits crackers.
sd	It's one of the small bottles.
nd	Well, it's about eight ounces.
ny	uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
sd	One tin. Of the flake.
ad	And drain it real good.
ny	Yes,
b	Uh huh,
b	Right.
aa	That's very true.
aa	Very true.
b	Yeah.
sd	It, was, Lawry's, I believe, or Lawler's.
qy	do you have a Sam's Wholesale Warehouse up there?
bk	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
ny	Yes,
sd	and they have the little papers between them.
sd	And I think they're, what, about nine dollars and something.
ny	Yes.
ny	Yes,
nd	And I thaw it
b	Uh huh.
bh	Is it?
sd	I love to eat it,
aa	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah .
b	Right.
sd	Well, I like to have mine all done anyway, because then I want to party, too.
b	You know.
b	Correct .
b	Right.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	really,
ba	That's hilarious.
b	serious .

b	Uh huh.
sv	TWILIGHT ZONE rules, man.
sv^r	TWILIGHT ZONE rules.
sd	That's all.
qy	Are you serious?
ba	That's psychedelic.
sd	Curly hair
ba	Cool,
ba	That's hilarious.
nn	No,
b^m	Yeah
bh	Are you serious?
aa	They're awesome.
bh	really?
bh	Really?
sv	Kind of annoying like, in front of T V, like trying to do homework, you know.
sv	Trying to write an essay, you start talking about, you know, like, IN LIVING COLOR or something,
ba	Cool,
ba	Cool,
aa	No,
aa	I know,
sv(^q)	It's, like, man.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.

bh	Yeah?
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?

fc^m	Okay.
fc	Yeah,
fc	Bye.
fp	Hi,
ba	Good,
qy^h	Total banner?
nn	No,
sv	But, I think that there ought to be some control,
no	Well, I don't know if a five day waiting period would be legitimate.
ar	Well, I don't think you can mail guns through the mail.
sd	I think that's against the law ever since Kennedy was assassinated .
qo	So, how do you feel about guns?
b	Uh huh.
qo	Then, how do you propose that we prohibit those types of individuals from gaining access to guns?
b	Uh huh.
bk	Okay.
sv	Well, I think that the police, or law enforcement have a need because of the tight quarters they might find themselves,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes.
aa	Yes,
sd	Very fine,
nn	No,
sd	That's still that's still, you can still do that down here.
ng	you can't,
na^m	It has to be on the hip .
b	Oh .
sd	they're, they're really bad for us.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I had an American Express, American Express Gold, an Optima, all the different department stores, two Visas, two MasterCards .
sd	I mean, I had,
sv	because, see, the more credit cards you have, the more people offer them to you.
sv	And the more you use them, the more they send them to you.
na	Exactly.
sd	but I know the Green card was like thirty five, forty five dollars a year.
sv	Which was a lot,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
sd	I ended up going through a credit counseling service because my husband and I just don't handle credit very well
sd	and, when you do that, they automatically, once you start with their service, they close your accounts out.
sd	So, I'm still paying on all these accounts,
sd	and I would prefer to keep it that way.
sd	and that's it.
sv	I think that's a really good way to handle it, because that way, if you paid off every month, you never have to worry about, well, how much do I have to pay these guys, you know, this month, you know.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	and we probably still have about another year to go before we're completely out of the hole.
sv	But I think they way the whole economy is going right now, it's just not good to be in debt.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd(^q)	And I thought, this is not right.
aa	I, yeah,
sd	I've learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand and my husband's too, because he's the same way I am.
sd	well, when we buy on credit we just don't have a concept of how much money we're spending until the bill comes in.
sv	And then all of a sudden you look at the bill
ny	Yeah,
sd	and that paid for a new transmission
sd	and things like that.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I admire you for having that mind set for not, not even getting, you know, past the thirty days,
b	Uh huh.
ba	I can imagine.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I think about all the money that we've spent on interest on all of our credit cards,
sd	and it's just incredible.
nd	We've never been able to take it off our income tax.
sd	and before that, I never owned a home or anything,
sd	So, really, it was always just money thrown away.
sd	And I never really thought about it because,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
sv	You know, for a lot of people it is very personal.
b	Yeah.
sd	And I would much rather own my own home than be renting it like we're doing.
sd	We're renting a house.
sd	But, you know, right now with the way our credit card situation is, there's nobody in the world that's going to give us a mortgage on a house.
b	Yeah.
sd	Hopefully within five years we'll be in our own home.
sd	But, I'm not really counting on it real soon.
ny	Unfortunately, yes.
sd	And, we had a review today
ny	so, yes,
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	Well, all the horror stories you hear about them I think are true.
sd	you know, we've looked around
sv	when you think about it, for what you're paying a hospital for well, even not as much care.
sv	It's not that expensive, really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, I'll be darned.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know my mother's in a unit that's mainly Alzheimer's
sd	and, we're convinced that she probably would be better off in a geriatric.
sd	the fact that these people , they're up and around,
no	well, who knows.
no	And, we don't know.
sd	and whether it's Alzheimer's or what it is nobody really knows,
sd	but it's, basically the same.
sd	but she has gone down steadily since she has been in,
br	I'm sorry?
nn	no,
sd(^q)	and we says, you know, mom, you know, if you get a, you get better, you've got to have the care, the doctor insisted on it, you know, if you get better that you could come out.
sd	Well, I think for me,
sd	South Alabama,
sd	And so I was very much a part of , you know, what was going on there.
sd	my parents are pretty active
sv	There's still a lot , you know, to be accomplished,
sd	because I can remember, you know, separate public restrooms and separate water fountains and sitting in the back of the bus and everything.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Right.
sd	And so we were always at family in different p , family members' homes.
sv	But even now, you know, they don't even do that.
sv	Well, and they're so busy.
sv	people's personal schedules are so busy.
sv	a lot of it has to do, I think with more women working
sd	in our family, you know, twenty years ago, not that many of the women worked.
sv	And now, almost all the women work.
sv	And, so that means, you know, , a lot of the social visiting and all was, I think, probably instigated by women at that time.
aa	Right.
sv	But even just social visits, people don't do that anymore.
sv	And people don't feel comfortable just to drop in on people anymore.
aa	Right,
sv	I guess we don't not to invade people's privacy or whatever.
sd	Well, out of fifteen grandchildren in my family, only two of us don't live within fifty miles.
sd	and most live within ten or twenty.
sv	but you know, that is rural, it's a rural family
sd	I'm just one of the two out of fifteen that don't live you know, even in the same state.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Probably the job market and the, the economy has always affected, social change.
sv	Probably.
sv	Well, I think just, also, you know, the women's movement, too, has affected a lot of social change.
sv	people marry,
b	Yeah.
sd	now, again, where I'm from in Alabama that's not necessarily true because people do still get married right out of high school.
sd	But now out here in Texas where I am now, that's very unusual.
sv	Most people I mean get, go to college or at least get a job
aa	Right.
sv	Because it affects child care
b	Right.
sd	Well, and you know, they're, they're saying right now, we just now are seeing the effects of day care on the generation that's just now coming into the work force and in their twenties.
sv	They are the first generation that basically grew up with day care.
sv	And so, you know, it remained to be seen exactly what that does.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Where do they live?
sv	Well, they're not too far, though.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I live like fourteen hours from home.
sd	In fact I'm, I'm driving tomor , I'm, I'm driving home tomorrow, so,
sd	To go be there for the Fourth of July.
sd	So I can make it.
sd	I'm thirty five.
h	I don't know,
sd	It's pretty much like get there
sd	It's just not that pleasant.
sd	Even with other people, I basically just don't like to drive that far.
b	Uh huh.
qw^t	When you say you're in the second phase of this project, what is the second phase of it?
bk	Oh.
ny	Yes.
qy	Have you recently bought a new car Catherine?
bk	Oh.
ba	wow.
sd	Well, I , the last car we got was a used car.
sd	But, mine was a year old,
sd	and we bought it for very functional purposes,
sd	and we bought a station wagon.
sd	but we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment.
sd	And I've never been sorry,
sd	however the need for that kind of car has changed now,
sd	and, while it is still good, and it's quite serviceable, and I'll drive it until it no longer is reliable.
sd	And probably then some .
sd	I think that I would like to,
sd	I'm sold on Nissans.
sd	a or foreign cars actually.
qy^h	its reliability.
sd	But I had a Ford Escort that absolutely needed taps the day we got it.
sd	you know, I mean it was ready for the graveyard.
sd	And I spent as much on that car in twelve months as I spent for the car.
sd	and that was just trying to hold us,
sd	But it just was not deliv ,
sv(^q)	and you say, no thanks.
sd	So, I just trusted the CONSUMER REPORTS and the auto, reports inst ,
sd	had my son who knows a lot about that, study them thoroughly,
sd	An Escort definitely was not among them.
sd	the Nissan came
sd	But it served our needs.
sv	but it's comfort.
sd	Nissan.
nn	No.
ny	Uh huh,
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I mean, you know, every one of us have two sides .
b^m	Yeah.
qw	and why?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Really was.
sd	And, I really have not seen,
aa	Of course.
b	Okay .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
ba	Good.
b	Uh huh.
sd	But if I had the little red C R X , I guess the interior would have to be black leather
sd	I'd just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to the wind .
aa	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bd	That's okay.
nn	No,
sd	But if I'm going to be traveling in that car for any period of time, I want some real good classical music.
sd	I love classical music,
sd	So I do love classical music
ny	Uh huh.
sd	W R R and the Oasis are the two that I listen to, more than anything else.
sd	And I do like them.
sv	Those compact discs, really are good for cars because they don't melt,
sv	they don't warp.
sd	You know, there's nothing in there that can wrap around the, rollers or anything.
sd	I'm a firm believer in having lots of them.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Good grief.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	That's what you do on at least one of your machines
b	on your Commodore.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
aa	Yes,
sd	Well, I do an awful lot of preparation of documents,
sd	some of them I do on a Sun,
sv	now maybe we don't call these personal computers,
sd	I work for the government in Washington.
sd	in, in, in an obscure part of the defense department.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	are, are you, are you also a professor,
b	Yes.
ba	I can believe.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	How many,
ba	lord.
sv	Well, I kind of decided that single children that, that's not parenting,
ad	Well, do not tell that to all my friends.
sd	I am into getting through the day.
sd	And when I take care of some people's kids, you know,
sd	when they have teachers' holidays, and that kind of stuff, I will take my friends' kids, that are usually in day care,
sv	and you can spot them, because they have no idea how to hang out and mess around.
b	Yeah.
b	Really.
sd	It's not a problem for my two,
nd	They can find things to do and mess around, and plot and scheme and everything else.
qy	did all five of yours complete college?
qw	Well, how did you go about selecting a college, then? .
qy	Do you think that what they say that they are interested in is, at eighteen is going to be what they are ultimately ultimately graduating at.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qo	How about the other three who went?
b	Uh huh.
qy	When they were, like in junior high and high school, I mean, did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sd^e	I went, four years to undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln, because Lincoln is where my parents live.
sd	And there really was not a choice,
sd	I mean the finances, dictated that you had to go there.
sd	I am not going to say I resent it,
sd	but I was, well you know, one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and, you know, one of the Rhodes Scholars kids, and the whole bit,
sd	my parents did not even discuss with me going to college out of state, or anyplace else,
sd	and I just knew that the finances, you know, would not support it.
sd	If I had known not, I am not going to say easy, but how much less difficult than I thought it would be to get a, scholarship, to go anyplace else, I think that I would definitely, you know, have gone .
sd	Now when I finished there, then I got a scholarship to go the Harvard University in Boston.
sd	And I think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened,
sd	And I think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me.
sd	Now my kids, I keep saying that, you know, I would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could.
sd	And I do not know, you know, what the realities, you know, is going to look like, you know,
sv	but I really think it's important to put these children someplace where, in addition to, you know, them getting an education, they really need you know, a socialization away from what they are raised in. Especially if you lived a pretty insular community
sd	and, An upper class suburb of Dallas, let me tell you, It's very different.
aa	You should not.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd^t	I was just now told that's what the topic was
sd	And, I guess recently one of the T V stations here, ran a series of, news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a person's credit card numbers. And use it
sd	and I was quite surprised at that.
sd	I don't know what I'd really do if it did.
nn	No,
sd	One of the things that upset me when I lived in California was, they did a lot of things with your Social Security number.
sd	As a matter of fact, they even went to the point of printing our Social Security number on your driver's license.
sd	And they would not cash checks unless they had your Social Security number,
sd	And I was really, you know, unhappy about that situation.
b	Right.
sd	You know, recently I purchased some magazines, U S NEWS and FORBES magazine.
sd	And every since that day, I have been inundated with, you know, subscriptions to this, subscriptions to that, this news letter, this investment letter, even to the point of people calling me at home.
b	Uh huh.
sv	From some list,
b	Uh huh.
^2	All their time.
b	Sure.
sv	I think the general public would be, you know, tremendously upset if they knew how easy it is for, let's say the criminal individuals to get access to people's records, their credit cards driver's licenses, checks, things like that.
sv	I don't think anybody really knows what to do about it.
sv	Computers caused a lot of this, I'm sure.
b	Sure.
aa	Seems as though they are,
ba	Unfortunately.
sd	Fortunately, I haven't, been inundated with that situation yet.
aa	That's true.
sv	I agree with you in the sense that, I think that it's important for people to, also share, give something of themselves
sv	and, I think that there's too much in, in a way of self gratification today,
sv	and there's not enough sharing.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	in fact I saw an interview on T V the other night with, Patrick Swayze,
sd	and he's making a movie in, I think it's, Calcutta or either India, somewhere where it's a very poor, poor country,
sd	and he said that people in the west,
sd	he said that his whole idea of what's important has changed,
b	Yeah,
sd	they dwell on what they do have
sd	he said that when he comes back he knows that it, it's completely changed his life.
aa	Right.
aa	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly right.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well I know that that must be true especially if you do something along the lines of, you know, helping them learn how to survive, how to plant, how to find water
sd	and I've seen so many, extraordinary things on T V, that people have done working in the Peace Corps and how, you know, the people of the community they worked in is so much better,
sv	it's like one person can make a difference,
sv	and I really believe that they can in something like that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I know
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
aa	I know.
sv	It's the sad life I think today.
sd	it's, it's not like it used to be even in the years of my growing up.
sd	I mean I'm fifty three years old,
sd	and I have seen a town change from a town to a city and its, people, you know, grow from a small town to a large town,
sv	and you would think that more people would be better, you know share more, do more, you know, be more community oriented and all,
sv	but if they just get more, unto themselves kind of,
aa	right
sv	and we would go out and not even lock our doors and not even worry about it.
sv	But today, I mean, you know, it's like you wouldn't even think of doing that.
sv	If you don't have bars on the window you're not even safe you know?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I was going to say
sd	and she had gone overseas to Tokyo,
sd	and she asked them there if there was anywhere that she shouldn't go because she was alone, you know being a girl from another country, and everything
sd	and she said they thought for a few seconds
sd	They said to her that even if she left her purse on the subway okay, that she would have that purse returned to her, this is how confident they were, okay, with nothing missing
b	okay,
sv	and you would think, you know, being, an American or whatever, you know, a foreigner there that, that would be all the more reason that they'd take advantage of you.
b	Okay.
sd	And she said she could tell them for fifteen minutes places not to go in, in and around Dallas,
sd	and that's where she was from.
sd	She said even choosing her apartment she had to be so careful because of being a woman alone,
sd	You know she had,
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	And that's why I think if people were more exposed to,
sv	especially, young kids getting out of high school.
sd	I mean at one time they would go into the service, to have the same exposure and, you know, to further their worldliness, so to speak. And go to see, foreign countries that they would not necessarily be able to afford to see,
sd	it was like they said,
sv	but nowadays, they don't do that anymore.
sv	a lot of young men don't even, have the desire to go into the service. Or to, you know, do something for someone else.
h	And I don't know
sv	the bonding process,
aa	It very definitely is.
aa	That's right.
sv	in other words like anyone can live, on a certain income no matter what it is,
sv	you have to, so to speak. Okay?
sv	it's what's important to you.
sv	I think that like girls today, have children,
sv	and six weeks later they're back to work.
sv	They don't even have a bonding with that child,
sv	it's the most beautiful thing that happens between a mother and a child. The first, like say, six, years of life.
sv	So much, happens in that period of time,
sv	and I mean once the child's in school if you had a job from say nine to three, big deal,
sd	I mean they're in school,
ba	That's great.
b	Yes,
b	Right.
sd	the Gramm Rudman Act.
b	Yeah,
aa	No,
aa	Yeah,
sv	The national debt is terrible.
b	Right.
sd	I saw one on TWENTY TWENTY about a month ago I guess, whereas one, I think that he was a Senator from Pennsylvania or something like that.
sd	and, you know, they asked him about it.
sv	And they do things that are, you know, just like the,
aa	Yeah
b	Right.
aa	Absolutely,
sv	whether you're mayor, all the way up, city council, the works, I think. Certainly President, that, two terms is plenty.
sv	And then we get these professionals out of there,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	that's why they think,
sd	Our national debt in the trillions of dollars, you know.
^2	Foreign aid,
sv	they've given that away for fifty years.
aa	I agree,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sv	They are at least doing something now, with the military, you know,
sv	But T I has gotten a lot of good contracts from the war and everything else.
sd	But, that's the only good that I've seen Congress do, you know, and everybody and all the Congressmen and the President and everybody,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	People need to take a stand.
sv	I think the next time we have an election we need to try to get some of the ones that have been there forever out, too, what they did last election,
sv	but they don't.
sv	may, may, maybe we can change and get us rid of some of those guys that are in there, guys and gals whatever they are.
aa	I know,
sv	you want it to stay as good as it possibly can be.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sv	Well I think one of the good ones in the metroplex, in the last say twenty five years or so, maybe longer, they've built all these dams.
sv	we've had good water supply,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	California should do more of that too.
b	Right.
sv	The water's critical.
b	Right.
fc	yeah,
fc	well, great,
fc	Well, it's been some interesting subjects,
fc	Thanks for calling.
fc	Bye bye.
b	Okay.
nn	no
sd	But over here we get enough water you know, naturally as well have the automatic sprinklers,
aa	that's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	and it's been real enjoyable, although I didn't do any this last fall, because our past winters have been so cold, they'd freeze down,
sd	and by the time the flowers would come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting .
sd	So I was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and spending too much money on something that was kind of more of a problem than it was rewarding,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
bh	did you?
sv	those are nice.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but I don't have any flowers on it.
nn	no
sd^e	I'm thinking White Narcissus or something like a white paper flower or so.
nn	No,
sd	but it's, you know, very small.
sd	But most of the houses here, if you have a pool, you don't have anything else in the backyard
sd	that's about the size of most of them.
sv	So, I guess we're kind of fortunate.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
sd	That's one part of gardening I haven't tried yet,
sd	Primarily with our local newspaper and T V.
sd	I listen to the radio but not like I did when I was working.
bk	Okay.
bk	I see.
sv	Well, that is one of the handicaps with both T V and radio.
qy	is that correct?
sd	Well, I can discuss a lot of the news that we have,
fc	So thank you for calling.
fc	All right.
fc	Good bye.
aa	Okay.
sd	long term is something we're starting to think about because our older child will be ready for college in about, gee,
fe	Good heavens.
qo	How about you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	And the old, if you can't see it, then you can't spend it, idea .
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	Yeah.

ba	But, gee,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	just the burning of the che ,
no	I don't know.
sd	But, you know, that's been a new thing in the last few years,
sv	and I guess some cars are a lot worse than others.
sd	the diesel cars.
b	Yeah,
b	Oh.
bk	okay.
bk	Oh.
b	uh huh.
b^m	Yeah.

b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Oh.
sd	when we've taken things to the dump, just the dump, that is, you know, closest to us,
sd	and I know that on windy days, you know they're always moving the trash over to different spots,
sd	and they've got those big bulldozers,
sv	and I'm sure that their homes are really quite dusty
bh	is there.
qy^d	Worried about their their kids getting,
sd	Well, one of the cars I'm thinking about buying next is, a nice, safe, small car,
sd	and we use that to get back and forth and haul kids around and so forth,
sd	and we have another four door car that I drive to work,
qw	what are you looking at?
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah .
b	yes,
b	yes,
sd	I really like the looks also of the new Mazda that they have,
sd	but you know, the costs of a new car and those new models are extremely out of our price range right now.
aa	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yes.
ba	Wow.
b	Yes.
aa	No,
qy^g	Very comfortable, smooth ride,
bh	it does?

ba	Well, that's excellent.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Yes.
ba	dear.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
bf	They charged you twenty five dollars just to tell you that,
b	Uh huh,
b	I see .
b	Uh huh.
b	okay.
qy^d	And found it right away.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
sv	Well, I think that, you have an excellent deal then,
sv	and those companies wouldn't be able to afford that for that kind of extended warranty or warranty at all,
b	Yes .
aa	No,
b	Yeah.
sd^t	he called in to get somebody on the line,
aa^m	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
nd	Well , we don't have a T V,
sd	so for the last year,
bh	Really?
b	Yeah.
sv	V C R, and everything else.
bh	Really.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ng	I don't think so .
sd	Well, see another thing was I worked on second shift for like a year and a half,
sd	and then before that I was in college for four years
sd	I mean I did watch T V
b	Yeah.
sd	Me too.
aa	I know,
sd	Well, almost a year.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I mean I never really watched it much growing up
sd	but I thought, you know, my husband would really like miss it because he was an only child
sd(^q)	And I figured no
ba	That's funny.
sd	I've seen CHEERS probably five times
sv	It's pretty cool
bh	you have?
b^m	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	I watched a lot of T V when the war was on.
sd	And then, I like watching a lot of like college basketball and, and pro football,
sv	I mean that sounds kind of stupid
b	Yeah.
sd	Sherman, Texas.
qw	Where are you from?
qy	So, are you really from Texas though?
sv	Well, sounds like you're from up north.
ny	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Well, I'm from Indiana.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	I used to watch OPRAH a lot in the afternoons, before I went to work and stuff
sd	and I see her every once in awhile like if I go workout at T I,
sd	you know, they have those T V s right, in front of the treadmills,
h	I don't know
sv	her disposition's gone downhill.
br^m	Was what?
ny	yeah.
qy	and did you see the show where she lost all of that fat?
sd	she wheeled it out on a cart .
ba	That was so cool,
ny	Yeah.
sd	I'd eat too.
bh	Really.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah
sv^t	Well, it's hard to talk about something,
sd	I feel bad cause I mean, I should know something about T V shows.
qw	What was that?
b	Uh huh.
no	I might of.
bk	Oh.
b	Yeah,
bk	Oh.
qh	You know, what my absolutely favorite show is?
sd	DAVID LETTERMAN.
sd	And SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE,
nn	Huh uh.
qy	Has it gotten better?
bh	Really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's funny.
sd	Like when WAYNE'S WORLD,
no	Well, I don't know,
br	Uh?
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	one friend of ours got rid of his because we, you know, cause we were getting along out ours
b	Uh huh.
qy	Is that on tape?
ba	That's funny.
sd	Purdue.
b	Yeah.
nn	No.
qw	Why
qy	Are you serious?
sd	I've been here three years.
ba	wow,
sd	We watch, M T V twenty four hours a day
sd	That's the girls I lived with
b	Yeah.
sv	It's pretty bad.
aa	No.
b	Okay.
sd	we use them for, paying our gas and for paying, just about anything, because, we don't like to pay for our checks .
sd	but we pay off every month, though,
b	Yeah,
sd	See, well, I don't do it either .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	and so it helps us gain interest in the bank when we do it,
b	yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	and then you know, you can have your card back with pretty good rating, you know, because you can pay fifty dollars, but not, you know maybe five thousand or whatever.
aa	I know.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	I also like to use Discover when I can, because they give you some money back every year.
ny	Yeah,
sd	Well, we just started doing that,
sd	it comes in handy for when you're buying things like, tickets for the train or, airplanes because they'll give you some money back, you know,
sv	and it's only a little bit,
sv	and so you know, it helps out here and there.
ny	Yeah,
sd	and they give you a half percent of that,
sd	and I know we're going to get back more this year, because you know, we spent a little bit more probably,
sd	and they do it for how long you've been a member I think, too
sd	and they increase the percentage a little bit.
b	Uh huh.
sd	so did I .
sd	I heard that was excellent.
bh	Is it?
sd	I wanted to see that .
sd	it was excellent.
nd	I heard the opposite that, you should take children to see it.
sd	there were quite a few, kids in there with their parents.
b	Yeah.
aa	Right,
sd	It was sad.
sd	But, it kind of shows how his, best friend, this little girl, deals with his death and I think, maybe, how children should deal with death.
b	Maybe.
sd	But, it was really good.
b	Yeah.
sd	I heard it was, sort of like, not, too violent,
bh	really?
b	Oh.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah,
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I have seen that at the theatres,
sv	that was cute.
na	the last movie I rented was THE HARD WAY with Michael J. Fox
b	Yeah,
sd	He's one of my favorites.
sd	I like his movies.
nn	No,
sd	But, there's been movies out that I've been wanting to see.
b	I see.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I watched that movie with, Barbara,
sv	that was pretty good.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
qy^h	with, Judith Light?
ny	Yeah,
ny^r	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
sv	They're more interesting.
sv	And it's hard to believe that, you know, this really happened.
sv	Some of them are pretty bad.
b	Yeah.
aa	Okay .
ny	Yeah,
fp	Hi.
b	Okay.
sd^t	as far as spare time, they talked about,
b	uh huh.
bh	have you?
bk	Oh.
qy^g	so you just sew everything up, huh?
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
bh	did you?
b	uh huh.
ba	my goodness.
qy	do you sell them?
bh	have you?
b	Yeah,
bh	really?
bk	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I, I can crochet and knit.
sd	and it's sitting in my closet half done right now,
b	didn't you.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
sd	And I do like sewing sometimes.
sv	But, it's just finding the time for these things that you you enjoy.
sd	I would love one of these.
ba	that's neat.
sv	those are wonderful aren't they.
aa	yeah,
sv	It'd be nice to have that.
ba	that's neat.
b	uh huh.
b	well.
bf	So you did buy a pattern, and then started from there.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sd	and I kind of made the pattern up.
bh	it did?
bk	Oh.
bk	Oh.
qy^g	You haven't sewn it back up, huh?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	But, I can, I had a hard time stenciling.
sd	And people have told me it's very easy.
b	Well.
b	uh huh.
bh	Have you?
b	All right.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	I bet you're McDonald's fan.
bh	Are you?
bh	is that right?
b	Yeah,
ba	I can understand that.
sv	They won't put up with that.
qy	And you had. And you had the kids with you?
qy	And they waited forty five minutes?
ba	I don't doubt that one bit.
qw	where do you like to go when you got a baby sitter?
qw	Where's that?
qw	What's the name of that again?
qw	what are they, what kind of?
bk	Yeah,
sv	Well, there's a zillion of them.
sd	That's a good place
sd	They've got one in Addison too, now,
sd	Good, good prices, good, good food there.
sd	If you like Mexican stuff. it's a good place.
qy	you ever been to Vincent's?
sd	That's a good seafood place.
ny	Yeah.
qy	You ever tried a place called Louisiana Purchase?
sd	Well, this is in Plano.
b	Yeah,
sd	If you like it kind of hot, that that is good food,
ba	that's good stuff.
aa	Yes.
bk	Yeah,
qw	Belt Line and what?
bk	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, you get, one free
sd	and, We've been from barbecue to,
sd	there's a Swan Club which is out Central and Campbell.
sd	if you like continental stuff, that is really nice.
sd	I mean it's not a cheap place,
sd	It, it's north of Campbell, but, off Central,
sd	it used to be a Northern Telecom Building in the ground floor.
sd	But it's a big, tall, it's the tallest building on the northwest side of Campbell and, just before you get to Campbell
sd	and it's in the lower floor,
ad	And, tell him to take you there for your anniversary,
ba	There you go.
qy	Have you ever been to Ewaldes
sd	My wife doesn't necessary like that stuff,
sd	And that's down in the Stoneleigh Hotel now.
sd	And that is really super kind of stuff, too. if you like Continental at all that kind of stuff
sd	either one of those two, you go through a hundred bucks without half trying,
sd	you don't have to spend that much,
^h	I'll tell you,
br	Pardon?
nn	no,
sd	but, they were in the area where I live
sd	and it was really revealing to see some of you know, the things that go on, I guess, in some of these homes,
aa	Uh huh.
nd	Well, actually, I have that kind of situation, because my mother lives with me,
sd(^q)	and, from the time that we were tiny, she said, you know, I want you to promise that you'll never put me in a rest home.
sd	So I know how she feels about it.
sd	I think that would be the,
ng	I wouldn't say any more than usual.
sd	I think it's very hard for her, to be waited upon, so to speak,
ny	Yeah,
sv	on the other hand, it takes on almost a switch of a mother child relationship.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	All right.
b	Oh.
sd	But, I do enjoy, going to a gym and working out,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ba	that's good.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right .
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	And, we go like fifty to a hundred miles every Sunday.
sd	So , I try to keep up in the winter with the exercise bike, so, I, you know, can be in shape .
nn	No,
ny	yeah,
sd	But, I'm not that energetic .
sd	I get lazy sometimes.
b	Yeah.
ny	yeah,
aa	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
fc^m	Okay.
fc	bye.
na	I do,
sd	but I just never wanted to get into the hang up of using credit cards and having all those bills hanging over my head.
sd	In fact, I remember getting my first MasterCard,
sd	And so that's why I went ahead and got one.
sd	It was a mistake .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I know how that goes
sd	we had no way around it
sd	and the only way to do it is go get, you know, an advance on a card
sd	and so like you were paying for it,
b	I see.
b	Oh.
qy	Do you find now, though, that even some doctors won't?
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	it is .
aa	I know.
b	Right.
sv	and now they've messed that up to where it really is a financial burden to have to pay it.
sv	but it, but it is easy to get into a credit card problem,
sd	and they just don't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments.
qh	You know.
aa	That's right.
aa	That's right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	No,
aa	That's right.
sd	I just, I, my husband is in business for himself
sd	I work for T I
sd	and, I, I've kind of got my fingers crossed.
sd	but you know, it's those once in a lifetime cases,
sd	and they should pay through next month,
sd	And, you know, just in one lump,
sv	or it's like you say,
sd	And so I'm really looking forward to that.
aa	That's right.
b	Right.
aa	Sure,
aa	That's right .
aa	I know
aa	I know.
ba	It's incredible.
sd	Boy, I wish I could say that my house and,
sd	I had to have the money to pay rental car, pay this, pay that till the insurance company pays back.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Sure.
aa	That's right.
sv	and so that is the smart half.
sd	and I can remember before we had kids, we did that a lot,
sv	while after kids, and you're paying child care and other things, all of a sudden it's not so easy to pay off,
sd	but I do like having them there.
sv	but you have to have a very good sense of saving, or common sense not to get yourself in trouble.
b	Uh huh.
qo	What do you think invades your privacy?
b	M C I
sd	now see I really don't have much trouble with, I just say no thank you and hang up.
sd	I had a carpet service call up three times, all within in an hour,
sd	but, I do telemarketing,
sd	so, I'm very polite
sd	So I think the only thing that really bothers me is when somebody contacts me
sd	Like the United States Census Bureau.
sd	That bothered me.
sd	I didn't feel they had a right to know how many bedrooms were in my house even.
sv	That I think is my invasion privacy because it's the government
sd	And I think that is my biggest objection to anything as far as invading my privacy. If somebody wants personal information out of me,
sd	I know when I do telemarketing, I'm a soft person,
sd	And I make very good sales,
b	Right.
sd	And I'm not pushing something down their throat that, I don't think is a good item anyway.
sd	That I don't think I could do anyway.
sv	I think that's invasion of privacy.
b	Yeah .
b	yeah.
aa	No,
na	Right.
sv	This to me is my invasion of privacy.
sd	Anytime I can honestly say no, or, throw the paper away, or,
sd	But, the telephone doesn't bother me because I leave it half the time, on, you know, answering service anyway, unless I'm home,
sd	so I figure I can turn it off one way or the other,
sd	that I felt was invasion because it was the same carpet place, and called me three times.
sd	like I don't know when the police has their project going
sv	Well see there's no way of knowing,
sv	you know, that's the problem.
sd	But, if we were denied the right to call people up, these people would never be able to get it.
sd	Because we offer it in a very low, you know, quantity.
bf	I gather you get a lot of telephone calls.
b	Yes,
sv	I think that's where they hit most of us.
sv	And you just know about what time,
sd(^q)	And they say, well don't you want to know what's free,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
ny	Yeah,
sd	and they just couldn't believe how many people were going out of their way to fill these things up.
sd	Instead of collecting plastic bags of garbage two days a week, they make a collection on Monday for yard waste,
sd	it's a pretty good size.
sd	And we put that out by the street,
sd	And then also, that same day, you put out a small tub,
na	Exactly,
aa	Yeah
sd	the trucks were being, the engines or something were being shipped over there for something or other.
b	yes,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
no	I don't know,
b	Yeah,
sv	So there's, it's possible that there is a person in Plano that doesn't buy any of those three things, and therefore wouldn't have.
b	Right.
sd	just the aluminum pop cans.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
na	I would.
aa	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah.
^2	Dump them off.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, now you say two different parts of the country
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, of course, you talk gun controls down here in Texas
b	Uh huh.
aa	Well, it's very true,
sd	Although I claim Florida as my home now,
sd	But I lived in Florida for ten years
sd(^q)	well in your words, they were a little bit too liberal.
sd	I mean they if I'm correct I believe they permitted their carrying concealed weapons.
sd	But they quickly did away with it.
sd	I think in the next session they modified it
sd	The the seven day the delay
ny	Uh huh.
sd	Well I don't mind that too much
sv	And Really the only objection we have Is you give a little
b	Yeah.
ad	Well then tell me
ad	Well let me ask you this then.
qo	what is your feeling about expressing yourself by burning the American flag?
ad	Well now wait a minute there
sd	you just said it.
qy	Then would you condone the burning of the capitol building?
x	
bf	then you don't draw a line between public property and a public symbol.
b	yeah
sd	but here again I go back to the second amendment
sd	Now I am I am adamantly against that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
nn	No.
b	Uh huh.
bf	even though you agree with me you you wouldn't do it yourself.
bf	Nevertheless you maintain that it is the right of any citizen to burn the symbol of their country.
bf	so long as it's their possession.
sd	and I used to know as a Boy Scout
sv	And, to me that's black eye to every man that ever carried a weapon or killed for his country.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's It's very easy to do.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well I think it should be permitted under certain circus circumstances.
b	Uh huh.
^2	within the own society, it can vary.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
aa	Well, I think that's, true.
sd	and, my wife teaches kindergarten here in Richardson.
sd	but, in general, I think the, you know, one of the reasons that we, chose to live in Richardson when we came here was the schools,
aa	right,
sv	and, although there's still some problems,
sv	and I think that part of it is not exactly with the schools, but with the, with the, the culture that doesn't value the education and doesn't value the schools and doesn't support, what the schools are trying to do.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, she works very hard as a kindergarten teacher.
sd	she has two half day classes.
sd	but her background is in, child development, and and, so forth,
sd	and so kindergarten is as high as she wants to teach,
b	So, yeah,
na	Sure.
qy	You mean like those, you know, twenty thousand dollar toilets ?
aa	Sure,
aa	Right.
sv	It takes you know, very little to just shop around and,
aa	That's true .
b	Yep.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
qh	I'm also wondering why our taxes are still so high considering like the world's probably in better shape now than it has been in the last fifty years .
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
aa	I know,
sd	Between Four Oh One K and the thirty four percent they're taking out for taxes.
sd	Let alone what I end up having to pay .
b	Sure.
aa	Nope,
aa	Sure
sv	in the first place, you know, there's also like taxation without representation.
sd	It doesn't take care of my needs .
sv	and people don't care anymore either.
sv	People don't want to go out to vote.
aa	Yep.
aa	No,
b	Yeah .
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
ny	Yes,
sd	and, you know, those times, well, she was there in the regular hospital.
sd	And then she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer,
sd	And, as far as I'm concerned, that is far and above any nursing home, because, you know, the, the elderly parent in question is around their own family.
sd	And it's all taken care of by, Medicare,
sv	And that's what I basically, view a nursing home as, a warehouse,
br	Pardon me?
aa	Uh huh.
b	Oh .
na	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sd	so this isn't like, just one, instance.
sd	In fact, her, experiences were invaluable to me.
sd	in fact, I don't know if I could have, held up, you know, without my wife, helping in this, this, in this case.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
ba	boy,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh .
b	Right.
b	yeah,
fp^m	Hi,
fp	Hi Ken,
ny	Yes,
b	Oh.
aa	Okay.
ny	Yes.
sv	I think they'll always represent a threat whether or not there's an active cold war or not.
aa	Probably not,
b	Right.
aa	Uh huh,
sv	and the great powers are always pitted against each other.
no	I don't know .
aa	But I agree right now they're not,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	See, I'm concerned that since he's banned demonstrations altogether, that he's going to do the type of thing that happened in Tiananmen Square,
sv	and, it's going to cause more civil war than is already occurring.
h^m	I don't know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	I guess as long as, they're fighting each other, we don't have to worry about them wasting their time with us.
na	Well, sure,
sv	and people are just too different.
sv	But unfortunately, people aren't that insightful.
sv	They just see that this guy prays differently and to someone else than I do.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
nn	No,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yes,
sd	That's one of the places I would most like to go.
sd	but at some point I would like to go to Moscow and, to, just to see all these things that you can see on television now and can read about
sd	and we didn't know what things were like.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	it's probably not dissimilar from what are they, the, the, the, I'm trying to think of the name of the, the , something like that in Northern Iraq who are actually countrymen of,
sd	I mean, some of them were split off into Israel, I believe,
sd	And they were split up into three different countries.
sv	and they're very dissatisfied,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
sd	and within five or six countries there are probably ten cultures of people,
sd	And they don't all have their own country,
b	Oh.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	I mean, they had the same ideals and the same basic beliefs.
am	the , they might.
sd	I haven't seen that yet.
sd	That's what I heard,
b	Yeah,
bh	Really.
^h	let's see.
sd	So we wanted to see what this is like.
ny	Yeah,
sd	I'm convinced now he can act.
sd	his, his karate is pretty good.
^2	Fighting.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
qy^d	I don't know if you saw GHOSTS or not.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
qy	Patrick Swayze?
b	Yeah,
b	Really,
qy	Have you heard of it?
b	Yeah,
sd(^q)	And I thought, what a strange combination,
sd	Well, actually, that, that it's actually Albert Brooks,
bk	I know,
sd	and they have to,
na	Right.
qy^d	I don't know if you've ever read Jonathan Livingston Seagull,
sd	They sort of move up to levels,
ad	So you can guess the rest of the plot.
sd	And that's pretty good actually.
ny	Yeah.
sd(^q)	I was, I went thinking it'll be okay, not great,
b	Yeah.
b	The other world,
sv	it certainly would explain the preoccupation with ,
aa	Right,
qy	Well did you ever see, FLATLINERS.
sd	it's on video now, I think.
sv	probably worth seeing on video.
aa	Almost,
sd	and they didn't just sort of make it silly.
aa	The story sort of keeps going and going.
fc	Bye bye.
b	Uh huh.
b	All right.
b	Yeah,
b	My community,
sd	Or Dye Community.
sd	And it's not a city, not incorporated,
b	Yeah,
sd	And, well, give you an idea,
sd	And, I do some interesting recycling things.
sd	I'm building our house right now
sd	So when I drive the car in the driveway in the afternoon, it will just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the, pressure side of a, hydraulic cylinder.
sd	And the weight of the car will crush, what's ever in the disposer.
sd	hopefully, it's not my wife.
sd	Well, I thought you know, I'd use it as an escapement type thing.
sd	and then you go over and release it
na	Very similar,
sd	Well, what it will be, you drive up on the jack,
nd	Until you pull the pin,
sd	Anyway I have another, recycling method I use.
qy	You know all that junk mail you get?
sd(^q)	The glossy paper that says, buy this, and send off for that and you have won and all that.
sd	Well, anytime they send me a return envelope I put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that I, you know, happen to gather up.
sd	Because, well, like I say, we live a way
sd	And I don't like that
sd	so I don't do that.
sd	I've had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff.
b	Yeah.
sd	For instance, I saw a thing on, NOVA, I think it was the other day.
sd	This guy has designed I mean recyclable items.
sd	Whatever he makes, it's all out of the same thing.
sd	See, so, plastic, it's all out of plastic.
sd	If it's metal, it's all out of metal.
sv	and, incorporating, you know, reusable materials you know, your assembly line into your actual scheme of product operations is is the only way to really do it on a broad scale.
sv	Make it financially, attractive to recycle
sv	and somebody will find a way to make money at it.
sd	Well, there is a guy in Dallas,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Okay,
sv	I can't think of many alternatives that could be more fair than having twelve people decide, although it's difficult because they all have to be unanimous.
no	I don't know,
sd	I guess, if you request one you can.
sv	And we have so many people already, you know,
b	Yeah.
b^m	Agree .
b	Yeah,
sv	Especially because there's twelve.
aa	I know.
sd^t	but then, again, you know, the, one of the questions they asked is, should it just be decided by a judge
sv	and sometimes they're pretty partial in their judgements, too .
aa	I know.
b	Yeah.
sd	I think in some cases they are.
sv	But they know they get to decide how severe the sentence is if it's, you know,
sv	so that's another thing where they have the power,
aa	I know.
aa	That's true,
sv	It could be,
sv	The unanimous vote is questionable, though.
sv	Because, I don't know if you should really have a jury for a small infraction.
sd	I don't know anything .
b	Right.
aa	No,
bk	Okay.
fc	Okay,
fc	Thanks.
na	Most assuredly.
ny	Yes ma'am.
sd	Don't always vote for somebody.
sd	I know that my late husband was simply indifferent.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	If I do not feel very strongly about an issue, then I see no reason to go vote.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, of course listening to the instructors, you'll find out that everything matters,
sv	Well that's the way you get to national
sv	and that's the way you make changes about your neighborhood,
sd	I know that I have been involved in preparing and in, carrying out a lot of the local petitions that take place.
sd	Even something so simple as getting a street light in between lights on the end of the block.
sv	But it makes a big difference when it's the difference in having a child run over in the dark.
sd	And, it took a close call to wake us up and cause us to take that kind of action,
ba	and that's completely unnecessary.
sd	but if you just cross that major street, the character of the neighborhood changes,
b	Okay.
sd	And it was for elderly people who lived alone,
sd	And all it did was to, in my judgment, make them, easier targets
aa	Uh huh,
sd	but it was on the, right side of the street.
sd	And, it, I think that they're much more comfortable there.
sd	I haven't seen too much crime in my neighborhood,
sd	but it's very serious just across the street.
ar	No,
sv	it was a dirty election.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, of course, now, that's not all the time.
sv	We've had some pretty We were having some pretty healthy campaigns that were based on issues there for two or three of the gubernatorial races
sd	but, historically, Texas has had mud and muddier campaigns
sv	I mean, I think that eventually, you know, the better people have sensibilities
sv	You don't want to vote for the person who is least likely to do damage.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	isn't that too bad.
^q	hey, we think this guy can really make some changes
sd	That was true in a lot of cases in a couple of the older sixties campaigns.
nn	No,
b	Yeah.
sd	Now, that's not to say what has transpired or what really was,
b	yeah.
sd	and it was people going to vote for, I think, more than those who voted against.
sd	I know that in my own, area of people, whom I knew and how they were going to vote, they didn't go to vote against, a politician as they did a little bit later when Nixon was running.
sd	They went to vote against the lesser of the two evils in certain cases.
sv	But I think that one was one that you had some very strong feelings among people,
sv	and they voted their convictions.
aa	Absolutely.
aa	You're right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I think that's wonderful.
sd	But I teach school
sd	And so I see a lot of, variation in what happens when kids are at home.
sd	I have taught school ever since my children were little.
sd	But the advantage of teaching school is your hours are closer to your children's
sv	So teaching, I think is a good career to have and still be able to spend a lot of quality time with kids.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	Well, with them being as young.
sd	And, I really didn't have that much of a choice because my husband was trying to finish his, college work and his Master's degree and so forth,
sd	and so it was a matter of somebody had to have a job.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes,
sv	Well, I think that, we need to spend more family time together with children today.
sd	we participated.
sd	when, the kids were in high school, it was harder to always have supper together,
sd	So, we had supper together as much as possible,
sd	but we've always tried to spend time to talk and, have some together time
sd	and we sat around the table,
sd	So I think that's been important, because we do have a close family
sd	and even though the kids are basically, grown, they still like to sit down at the table and us all eat together when they're here and have spoken before of, they want that kind of, you know, situation for them you know, and their children when they marry and have children.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
qy^d	and then you see them magnified in the children.
ba	boy,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
aa	It is.
sv	and I think we make a point to do that.
sv	Because , we see all the time, the outcome of not doing that
sv	and I think if we weren't so interested in children, in child care, then we wouldn't be teaching anyway.
sd	I wish we could reach more of the rest of the world .
sv	I think, the major problems in education are not what's happening in the schools,
sv	And, they expect us to, you know, create miracles at school and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the parents as well as that of the teachers
sv	and you get to a point where it's completely impossible.
sv	And you just get more and more frustrated
b	Oh .
b	Oh .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, I understand that.
sd	And so, we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks
sd	I don't seem to find time in the day time.
sd	And of course, it is motivation that is keeping me from really looking for that opportunity.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	of course, I could lose certainly from ten to twenty pounds
sd	but I think more than that,
sd	And that is something that I am motivated about now because I do need to get myself feeling better just in better shape.
sd	But, all the same it is connected to my attitude,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sv	And you have less chance of hurting yourself.
b	Yeah.
sd	I was suffering for about three weeks later.
sd	and I have never had that problem before
sv	but I guess that age just starts to catch up to me .
sv	It is showing up in the weirdest places.
bh	is it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
b	Yeah.
sd	and that is a little less burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her.
sd	And I can put on the earphones to have something to listen to
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and I actually get more tired doing that, than
na	I really am,
sd	I like to listen to national public radio, all things considered.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sd	Well , we, we have a big newspaper situation.
ny	Yeah,
sd	I don't like to, you know, I like to save the editorial information or , the politically, weighted information, you know, for a different section.
sd	the DALLAS MORNING NEWS is the one that's still here.
sv	And, the MORNING NEWS was, i , is okay,
sd	You know, many times it , doesn't reflect my own opinion
b	Uh huh.
sv	But, you know, you see, you see Troy Aikman's knee surgery on the front page, you know.
b	Yeah,
qw	you know, you know what I mean
sv	there is, local news that really a lot of times doesn't change my life one way or the other.
aa	Right,
qo	how about you?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	Right,
b	Uh huh.
bk	Oh.
ba	Wow.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It's pretty normal for this year, you know,
sd	So it's not been bad at all.
ng	I'm from Texas.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	they had some flooding in Houston the other day, real, real bad I think it was over the weekend.
sd	The radar just looked nasty with a bunch of red splotches all across it.
aa	that's, that's right.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	do you get east winds a lot of the time from the ocean
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	That's the way it does here most of the time.
sd	But, sometimes it just comes straight from the north
sd	depends on how strong the cold fronts are.
sd	well, Richardson's a suburb of Dallas.
ng	Hardly ever, unless there's a hurricane or something like that.
sd	I was going to say, the weather man on, one of our stations was talking about the way that the weather's doing now is like tropical weather,
aa	Yeah.
ny	Uh huh.
sv	Wiped everything out.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	do you get many tornados this time of year
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	there's just hills.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
sd	they took a bunch of film of it.
sd	and it tore up the people inside the car.
sd	And the camera man on the news crew held the camera out,
sd	I'm surprised they didn't, because we saw it on the news a couple of days in a row
sd	But over here, it's a big thing about tornados and people that get pictures of them.
b	Yeah
b	Yeah.
sv	It's really strange the way it does that.
sv	Especially the way it starts.
sd	and, and usually it's not even raining when it starts.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
fc	Have fun playing tennis.
fc	Bye bye.
aa	Okay.
ng	Well, I left T I in January
sv	I think that's a, that's a good idea.
b	All right.
nn	no,
sd^e	Actually I had basically set my sights to leave T I when they announced there would be no salary increases in ninety one, because I def , definitely need to make a little more money,
sd	and, I haven't really accomplished that yet,
ng	I wish I did.
ft	Thank you,
qo	how about yourself,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ba	Well, that's great.
b	Oh.
aa	It really is.
sd	You know, I'm always afraid I'm going to need some and where will it be.
nn	So, no,
sd	I tried to hang onto a house that was way too expensive for me,
^q	this is the reality.
na	Sometimes I have.
aa	Uh huh.
aa	Well, I'll check that out.
qy^d	You've learned a lot.
ba	Well, that's good to know how,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ad	Excuse me, Jim,
cc	I'll be right back.
ft	Thank you.
b	Oh.
qw	and how did your daughter get scholarship money on?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow,
aa	I'm definitely going to be actively looking into that.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's great to know.
sv	well, you're doing just fine,
ba	goodness.
b	Uh huh.
aa	absolutely.
sd	I hope you can do that.
sd	what I did is
sd	and I really enjoyed it while I was at T I,
sd	And, I'm out trying to sell telephone systems to businesses.
sd	And the potential there is fantastic.
sd	The reality of it is it's tough .
aa	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
b	Yes.
bh	They do?
aa	I'm going to check that.
aa	Definitely, I will.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that sounds fantastic.
aa	I agree .
b	Yeah.
sd	I know that I have three children.
sd	And, I stay home.
sv	And, I know that it must be really challenging to, try to juggle a job and also your children.
sd	And I also notice that the children that come over here to play that go to daycare every day they don't like to be around adults.
sd	They don't want to play around adults.
sd	And they're the very same age as my children.
sd	And I'm finding as I volunteer up at the school, I just, being,
sv	And you can just tell in their personalities and how they respond to the adults the ones that are home and the ones even that are at home that are getting the love and attention that they need.
sd	Not that the kids that go out aren't getting that
sv	it's just a different,
sv	they're not use to being with adults and to responding to adults.
sv	I think the trend in the United States,
b	Right.
b	Right.
sv	It's hard.
b	Right.
aa	Right.
sv	I think with working moms, if you can get the bosses to give you almost like a rotation like they're going to do with year round school where you work,
b	All right,
aa	Right.
sd	I vaguely recall
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	It seems like there were on awful a lot of people making loans and business decisions on a
sv	or I just since that they didn't have a commitment to the stability of the organizations they were making the decisions for.
qy^d	And I don't know whether that's because they had other opportunities to which they could move, you know, that it was that easy for them to find new work that they weren't stuck to where they were
qrr^d	Or whether they had extracted enough money in a percentage base that they didn't care any more,
b	Okay.
qy^d	Well, they didn't have a since of risk.
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Okay.
bk	Okay.
sd	is your since that we now understand how bad it is, / * listen
bf	So you don't think necessarily they don't have a complete grasp yet,
b	Uh huh.
bf	To be caught in the .
qy	Do you think possibly that it will help with the regular banks?
sd	It seems that I recall reading let's say starting three years a go but not so much in the last year of bank risks relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like Mexico, Venezuela. and Argentina based on oil loans
sd	and then the price of oil had gone south resulting in those loans being very risky,
b	Uh huh.
bf	And so you think that it's just gone.
b	Okay.
qy	Do you think it is necessary to have the federal guaranty program
sv	so I guess I feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected the possibility exist for these sorts of problems.
bf	so your since is that, the loan guaranties really were accounts guaranties, so that the account holders that if something went wrong they would have their money.
bf	And given that the S and Ls have had disasters then are, their money is still being protected.
bf	And it's million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands I guess of, Of dollars being protected.
sv	it seems like, there was a lot of money being protected in multiple accounts,
sv	And perhaps multiple people in multiple S and Ls
sd	I guess I'm content with the need to have protection on accounts
sd	and let alone any of them that went bankrupt.
sd	because that means, I'm not worried enough,
sv	it's kind of thing where maybe we'll survive
aa	Uh huh.
sv	maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation,
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	me neither .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	I work at a bakery because I'm still a, a college student.
sd	But, we have to wear white pants and, any color T shirt, as long as it's not like a bright color, like a pastel.
ny	Yeah.
ny^r	Yeah,
sd	And we wear aprons and have to pull our hair back
ny	Yeah ,
b	yeah.
aa	I know .
b^m	Yeah,
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
aa	Yeah,
sd	I don't need them yet .
b	really.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
sd	wow, I love shoes.
sd	I always buy shoes .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
sd	I like the, the like suit look, professional like, you know, look,
sd	 I'm going to be a teacher,
b	yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
bh	really?
b	Oh.
sd	I like the like stretch pants, the cotton ones.
sv	They're really comfortable.
sv	With a baggy sweatshirt.
b	yeah.
b	Oh .
sd	I have a pair of those.
b^m	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah .
sd	Sweaters and.
b	Yeah.
b^m	Yeah,
sv	I think that the space program has done a lot of good for the country.
sv	and I think some of the earlier approaches were much better in many ways.
sd	I wish the post office would just stop raising our rates.
sv	I think, though, now that we're finally starting to get over the fears and I don't know, the guilt that we had out of, Challenger,
h	But, I don't know.
sv	The space station's where we should go at this point.
qo	Well, where do you think we ought to go with it?
qy^g	Well, I think about half the nations now are military related, are they not?
sv	And, It seems like that high a percentage.
sv	Well, it can't afford to .
nn	No,
sd	We need to go.
bh	Have they?
b	yes.
sv	Well, maybe I need to run out there this weekend.
qy	Now do you have to have tickets ahead?
sd	I think both of my kids are too old for that
ny	Yes,
qy^d	It's very impressive, I'm sure.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, see, that's something else.
sd	and see we've yet to keep anyone up over over a week or ten days.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right or their satellite dish .
sd	On top of the recreational vehicles.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	no.
b	Oh.
sd	That would make me nervous .
qy	Have you done any camping around here?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ny	Yeah.
aa	Yeah
aa	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
sd	and there was nobody else, hardly, around
bh	really?
b	Yeah.
b	yeah
b	Uh huh.
ba	That sounds nice.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
aa	Right .
aa	Yeah.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bk	Oh.
sd	And, yeah, you can, if you can reverse the, nozzle on your vacuum cleaner
sd	and it blows air out instead of sucking it in
nn	No.
b	Uh huh.
ba	no .
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
sd	we take our dog camping.
sd	she sleeps in the tent with us.
sd	me either.
ba	no.
b	Uh huh.
ba	boy .
ba	That was lucky.
sd	We've been lucky.
ba	I bet it,
nn	No.
sd	the little tent comes up the top
sd	and it had two double beds in it.
sd^t	since the beginning.
na	well, I work as a temporary in the Speech Lab.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	they turn them over to somebody
aa	Right.
no	I don't know.
aa	Yeah,
ny	Uh huh.
sd(^q)	Like if they say I, I, we just type it in like that.
sv^t	Well, I guess that's it for camping, .
aa	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
qy	Have you ever camped on sand?
sd	That can be a mess.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
fc	Okay.
fc	Well, it's good talking to you.
fc	Bye.
b	Okay.
sv	Well, I'm sure that, probably every person in this country would agree with you on that. Because everybody has a different idea of where the money should go.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah,
b	Yeah,
aa	that's true,
sd	Well, of course now, we used up twenty per cent of that inventory, in a matter of just a few weeks,
sd	and, T I also makes the missile, which was the T V laser guided bombs
sd	and, a big percentage of that was expended, as well,
sd	it's called Paveway.
sd	And, a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also.
aa	no doubt.
aa	Yeah,
^h	okay,
sd(^q)	Then we had a number of education reforms, that the legislature said, hey, we got to do this, we got to do this, we got to do this,
b	Really.
sd	So, so what ended up happening was a, was a shift.
na	complete.
sd	but, I am opposed to, any attempts to restrict, local communities from taxing themselves above that to provide above the minimum.
sd	So did I.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	I can believe that.
b	Yeah,
sv	Well, I guarantee you'd be paying a lot more in taxes if, the Democrats had more say.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, what, what they've been able to do is slow down the rate of increase . to keep it from becoming even more obnoxious.
fc	Well, this has been really interesting,
fc	Nice talking with you, too.
fc^m	Bye bye.
fp	Hi,
na	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ft	Thanks.
sd	We haven't quite decided if I'm going to,
sd	But if we do, then I'm going to need to find somebody,
sd	and we know a lot of people at the church
b	Uh huh.
aa	Uh huh.
aa	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Time, uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	and so, I guess it's such a growing concern,
b	Right.
^2	To children.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah .
aa	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	but, I figure, you know, I'd probably start asking around at church because I know they have a limit as to how old they can be you know, before you can bring them in.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	So, you know, changing the oil, changing the spark plugs
sv	so there goes the carburetor
b	yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	It's got the, the good old three fifty, standard engine in it.
sd	Regular gas engine,
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
aa	Well that's true .
sd	A few years ago I had an Oldsmobile diesel
sd	And, the injector pump went bad
sv	diesels don't require mechanics,
b	Yeah.
sd	Well the injector nozzle and stuff in, you know, the big diesel farm tractors, you know, what are about the size of your thumb,
aa	yeah
sd	He was out at Tech
qw	What,
b	Yeah,
sd	and it was the van that I needed then, to buy the, you know,
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I think the little Chevy V eight when it started out in fifty five, I think was two sixty five, something like that.
sv	Little, you know, not whole lot more than the, than the six cylinder that I think was like about two thirty five or so.
sv	Well that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up.
sd	The two little cars I've got now,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
sd	The friend of ours over here, he's got, sixty five, or sixty six Mustang the six cylinder.
sd	And, I was look under the hood of that the other day
sv	It's amazing.
sv	yeah, you could stand in there if you really wanted to, I guess.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	And it had all the air pump and, I don't know, all that stuff.
aa	And all the anti smog stuff.
aa	Uh huh,
qy^d	it's that one that's about, what an inch and a half wide.
qy^d	Got a bunch of groves in it.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	it's the, it's usually that power steering be ,
aa^m	Everything's got to come off.
fc	Yeah,
fc	If it's winding down or what.
fc	Finding a taker.
fc^m	Yeah, well.
fc	Okay,
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	and that way they are able to reduce prices because you know, it's all one centralized thing.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
sd	I forget how much I paid a month
sd	And, the reason I quite was not because I didn't like it,
sd	so, we went to the, the medical insurance that we have here at work,
sv	once you find the doctor that you like it's not a problem.
sd	and then, we did find several good doctors.
sd@	that included, you know, the doctors, the time, the hospital an , everything. Delivery room and everything.
sd	including a private room because there was a little extra that she had to pay
sv	It's really nice because th , you know, their, their attitude is different than a regular, health insurance, in a, H M O, you know,
sd	they charge five dollars
sv	you're more willing to go in and try, to take care of a problem before it grows big.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sv	You know, they get a lot of, people who just have to be there and can't afford it
sv	so they, have to absorb it somewhere else.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	Right.
sd	Well, typical lawn stuff.
sd	and really all I do to it is,
ny	Yeah.
na	I do it myself.
sd	Have a lot of people trying to do it for me .
sd	Hey, I need the exercise,
sv	Hey, you've got the right idea.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah .
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
bk	Okay.
b	Yeah.
sd	and some people call them May beetles.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sd	I caught Wolfe with, one of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents,
sv	that was late,
aa	Yeah,
sd	And I had to water it, you know
fe	gosh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Pittosporum is kind of borderline here
sd	and usually it'll do pretty well,
sd	and it zaps it.
b	Yeah.
sv	Your list is growing,
b	yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	I had a small vegetable garden that,
sd	It did pretty well,
sd	and, our garages come in you know, from the alley
sd	and, it's a little piece of land over there .
sd	Well, I had, tomatoes and, peppers,
sd	and by the fence I had cucumbers, which didn't do real well,
sd	they kind of came out looking like gourds.
sd	But I had squash,
qy	A type of work station?
qy	Is it a two eighty six or three eighty six base machine?
qy	It's eighty eighty eight?
bk	Okay.
b	Okay.
sd	And I have I B M clones in both cases.
sd	Here at work I have the T I one thousand which is a three eighty six base machine.
aa	Yes,
sd	for example, I was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size.
sd	And I know that, brings an eighty eighty eight machine to it's knees because , I had taken it over from a friend who was working on it
sd	and it brought it to it's knees. Just in the ability to handle.
sd	And then I have, a three eighty six F X a sixteen bit machine, at home.
sd	And I'm really pleased with it.
sd	It manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and, database searches.
sd	what I've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them.
sd	To try to make them more effective and useful.
qy	Have you been, struggling along those lines?
sv	Well, I think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as I used to call it.
sd	at least the version I had tended to keep copies of that. Of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of a sudden you got a disc full error. Not a fun thing to try to recover from.
sd	Very frustrating.
sd	Well, it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build. to one level down from assistant description.
aap	Well, I sure need them.
aa	Yes,
ba	Well, I understand that , you know.
na	Right.
aap	came out around the first of the year.
sd	It does a few more things, than had been available before.
sd	But I'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement. you know,
fc	You do the same.
fc	Bye.
sd	we have two and another one on the way.
ny	Well, yeah,
b	Yeah.
ng	Two boys.
sd^m	Two boys .
nn	No.
sd	We like surprises.
qy	are the two boys first?
aa	Maybe,
ba	my goodness.
aa	yeah.
qy	Do you have horses?
qy^g	just, she knows people that does,
bh	does she?
^2	Advanced.
sd	So, I do know about that program
b	uh huh.
aa	yeah
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	how neat.
bk	Oh.
sd	Well, as far as our activities, we are kind of on a different level here.
aa	Yeah,
sd	They like to,
sv	both boy things .
b^m	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
br	The what?
aa	well yeah,
b	Yeah .
bk	Oh.
b	Yeah.
aa^m	It is fun.
aa	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	come about this time of year I am kind of ready for it to start getting spring,
aa	Yeah,
ba	my gosh,
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
aa	Uh huh,
sd	I try not to use them too often.
sv	So, sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
aa	Yeah,
sd	so that I use, because I travel some.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	the temptation's too great.
aa	Yeah,
fc	Yeah,
fc	Uh huh.
fc	Okay,
fc^m	Yeah.
fc	Yeah,
fc	okay,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, I know if they make the advances that they have been making, that, maybe age or even physical, abilities may not be, a barrier anymore.
aa	Yeah,
sd	and, that vacuum , little space program was one of the big, you know, backers of that.
sv	It's amazing, you know,
ny	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
sv	I guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps.
aa	That's right.
aa	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	But, yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think, it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they haven't, or experience something, you know, indifferent.
aa	sure.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah .
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sv	But you just don't think about them.
aa	And that's true.
ny	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	and, and I guess before I'd like to see that severe of a punishment for it it has to be an absolute certainty you know, like, caught at it, or something
sd	you know, or if they, you know, severely beat up on a child, you know, I would have absolutely no problem at all you know, with,
sd	I don't buy the routine, they're just sick,
sv	well, you know, forget that.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, but I can't see that either.
sv	I think if I wanted to badly enough, I could convince somebody, I was crazy ,
b	Uh huh.
sd	That's the new one.
aa	Well, you're right,
bk	No,
b	well, yes,
sv	you just don't know,
sd	it used to be just capital murder,
sd	you know, because I have a feeling it is,
aa	Yeah,
ny	Yes.
ny	yes.
na	absolutely.
sv	I think that, it's kind of discouraging to,
ba	Well, that's a thought.
no	I don't know
sv	that I think probably one of the reasons that people don't vote more is because they don't know the candidates.
aa	Absolutely.
aa	That's right.
qy	Now if you just skip one election?
b^m	Three.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think that's an excellent idea because then people really have to think about it.
^h	No excuse.
ny	Uh huh.
sv	I think that's great.
nd	Actually, you know, my husband has run for office before
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	they do have to check them off a list when they vote
sv	so hopefully they couldn't.
sd	Well, I'm not really certain how I, I'm not certain that it does a lot of good. I mean, that it ends up effectively, avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment penalties.
h	Yet, on the other hand, I don't know,
b	Uh huh.
sv	and everybody knows exactly what for.
sv	you know, and here, with our court system and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can kind of always count on the fact,
b@	Uh huh. Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	you know, and it's , sort of a crass perspective on the usage of capital punishment,
sd	but on the other hand, you know, I don't know if that is, that is that serious that they're really never going to be out of jail, ...
b	Uh huh .
aa	I know,
b	Yeah,
sd	I'm in Texas.
nn	No,
qw	where are you calling from?
bk	I see,
sd	I guess there is more and more states that are going back to capital punishment.
sd	They by, do it by lethal injection.
sd	I'm originally from Kansas
sd	I still remember the, the movie, IN COLD BLOOD.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
sd	and so it's not particularly graphic,
bh	Is that right?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
qy^d	Has a real bullets
b	Yeah,
sd	I've always said that if I had to kill and clean and do my own meat, I think I'd become a vegetarian.
nd	Well, I don't do much of it here.
sd	roaches and,
ny	yes.
sd	Just awful.
bh	you're kidding.
aa	It must be.
sd	Me, personally can't,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
aa	No .
bh	really?
sd	Well, it's been real hot here lately.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ng	well, not here.
sd	Well, I liked it a little bit
sd	and so that I think really, hampered it a little bit.
aa	Yeah.
nn	No.
fc	nice talking to you.
fc	Okay,
qw	How old are you Lisa?
bk	Okay.
sd	I'm older.
sd	Older than you are.
b^m	Okay,
b^m	you are from Plano.
ny	Yes,
b	Yeah,
qw	Anyway, so, where's your favorite place to go?
qw	Where in Arizona?
bk	Okay,
qy	Pretty hot isn't it, in the summer?
ba	That's good.
ny	Yes,
b	Yes.
nn	no,
sd	We're going to go in March after my children's birthdays and get all that business out of the way.
b	Yeah,
sd	It was the coldest it's been there ever in January ,
sd	But, I would like to go to Tempe.
sd	I mean, I have been up until just a few months ago.
na	I know a lot of good places to go.
ny	Yes,
sd	I live in Yakima, Washington.
sd	So it's cold and rainy today.
qy	Do you use NuSkin skin care.
bh	Do you?
sd	I'm a NuSkin person.
ny	Yeah,
sd	but I'm my best customer.
qy	Since we're not supposed to talk about this, though, is there anything more intensive for the eye area than the eye cream?
sd	I have that, too.
ny	Yeah.
sv	NuSkin is wonderful.
sv	I think it's a wonderful product.
ba	my gosh.
b	Yeah,
ba	That's good.
ba	That's great.
ad^t	Anyway, so we're supposed to be talking about places to go
qy	Do you ski?
qy^d	you probably ski very well in Utah.
qw	Why did you move to Utah?
qy	is that where B Y U is?
bk	Okay,
qy^g	pretty down there.
qw	So, where, have you skied?
b	Sure.
b	Sure,
b	You're a junior.
ba	Good for you.
ad	don't be in any hurry.
ad	You really should go to Europe.
sd	I traveled with a group of sixteen other students.
sd	six weeks.
ny	Yeah.
nd	well, at that time I was in a, Trenton , New Jersey
b	Yeah.
aa	I think you're right.
sd	So, I'm comparing my life when I was in high school thirty years ago to what I see these children doing.
sd	And the pressures on the children, you know,
sd	I cannot believe, what they're doing, academically the demands on them
b	Uh huh,
sd	And you didn't, you didn't have to lock your door.
sd	some of these are urban worries
b	yeah, to
sd	the first rights we've been having some problem now
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
sd	the Washington riots weren't,
sd^r	The Washington riots weren't
sv	the kinds of diseases that you've got out the,
sv	I mean the consequences is
aa	Uh huh,
aa	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
sv	you know, they're constantly, excusing their, child
sv	and you can see exactly, why the child is that way.
sv	You as a teacher, can't hold a child accountable, if you're not going to get reinforced by, that at home.
sv	And you can't make up in a classroom of one hour a day, what's not been done for, fifteen or sixteen years at home,
sv	and you get mixed signals
b	No .
sv	Of course, life is a lot more complicated too in ways,
sv	you know, with farming being so mechanized, people working on the family farm which was a traditional American way that becomes less and less likely,
sv	factory jobs are so much more, sophisticated.
sv	it's requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force
sv	And you worry when, you know the sex and drugs on the young children and the unborn children,
sv	in terms of what it's going to mean to a society, in the future it's a
sv	some ways it's rather frightening,
aa	It certainly is.
qy^g	It was a little easier though wasn't it?
b	Yes.
o@	Yeah. And all the things demanded of the mother too I mean,
sd	I look at my mother's life
sd	and I sit here,
aa	That's right.
aa	That's right,
sv	They need you more as a teenager .
aa	that's so true,
sd	I find working in a high school is very helpful because it let's me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do,
sd	and it keeps me from being the old fogy
sv	but that's the same
sd	I'm home at three o clock when the children are at home
sd	one is now a senior in high school and the other's in college,
na	it, it does,
b	Uh huh,
aa	that is, that is so true,
sv	and it's not that the children always say something
sv	and you realize it's important that,
b	Uh huh.
qw^d	And your name was?
fc	Well I enjoyed, talking with you.
fc^r	Well, I enjoyed talking with you.
fc	Okay.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	lots of different kinds I guess.
sd	Texas
b	Uh huh.
sd	you know, they have that type of music,
nn	no.
sd	And I like I like rap music.
b^m	Not really .
b	Okay.
qw	What kind of rock music do you listen to?
qy^d	Seventies and like that stuff.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah .
qy	Like have you heard of Carmen?
b	Striper,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
na	She does.
sv	She's real good.
sd(^q)	I don't like the country music that's like my wife left me, my dog left me, everybody's left me.
aa	Yeah.
sd	You know, I like Randy Travis
sd	you know, I like more of the real new ones, you know.
^h	Garth Brooks,
ny	Yeah.
nn	No,
qy	But aren't they done with?
sd	And I just thought that they done broke up and left.
ba	Wow,
ba	That's interesting.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Okay.
b	alright.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Uh huh.
aa	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	So, I just don't like you know.
h	So, I don't know .
b	Yeah. {F Uh,
sv	So, and the advertisements on television lately have been so,
sd	like tr , train wrecks and things like that
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sd	they feel that's not fair and whatever,
sd	I've had a lot of dental work done,
ny	yeah.
sv	Well, you would think so.
sd	and I worked for a dentist
sv	I would think,
h	I don't know.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, and, you know, if they do find someone who is, having a problem with drugs
sv	because a lot of people, seems like, obviously are trying to hide that from their employer and friends and family and things
sv	and too many people are just dying. Particularly in our area.
qw^d	I don't know what the crime is like where you are,
aa	Uh huh.
sd	and I got a piece of paper from my husband's office,
sd	it looks like a sticker
sd	Well, Minneapolis isn't too bad.
sd	that's kind of gone up in scale and some other things.
sd	But, actually, you know, when you look at Minneapolis as compared to where I used to live, it's really quite a bit better. because I came from Florida
sd	and in Orlando, crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever,
qw	What part of California are you from?
bh	really?
b	Yeah .
aa	yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sv	That's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like,
b	Sure.
sd	Well, interestingly enough, right before I moved up here,
sd	but in Orlando, before I moved up, we had a real problem with it.
sd	And one of the things that I helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation down there.
sd	it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work, you know,
sd	and then the houses were left unguarded,
bh	is that right?
b	Oh.
ba	That's amazing.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Really, you know.
b	Yeah,
sd	Like one of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he's from Detroit
sd	and, the crime level there, of course, is quite a bit, more pronounced,
b	but, yeah.
na	Pretty much.
b^m	Yeah.
sd	And then I left right in the middle of it.
b^m	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sv	even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps,
sv	it's against the law to do a lot of things, you know.
sd	they did in Miami that time.
ar	That's not always true.
nn	No.
sd	and essentially what he had done is set a elec , a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home.
sd	The guy came in while he was home
ny	Yeah.
sv	It's like your hands are very much tied.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I'm having a problem right now with a computer that we've just returned.
sd	So, for me it's actually a pretty good topic.
aa	Yeah,
b	Oh.
ba	I can imagine.
qy^d	You can't read labels
ba	Good.
na^m	Okay.
ny	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	Well, we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project,
sd	And we called up the company that somebody else we knew had dealt with,
sd	And so we went there,
sd	And it's called a user boards
sd	And he told us there's sorry, two six , four sixteen bit slots and two eight bit slots available for the user,
sd	And at this point we only have one board
nd	Well, it has them
sd	they told us there would be no problem because, you know, the salesman just doesn't really know.
aa	Right.
sd	So, we went back in,
sd	And, he goes and gets it, brings it home,
sd	And see now we're dealing with having to bring it back again
sv	you know, it's just this problem with sales people just not knowing what goes on.
b	Right.
sd	So, well, actually some things are pretty good with that because I put it on a gold credit card
ny	Yes.
b	Yeah.
sd(^q)	Well, because these guys if they, give us a hard time we're going to say, you, look, you know,
sd	I just tell the credit card company, don't pay the charge, even though they've already paid it.
sd	But they'll just, you know, undo the credit that they did to them.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	no.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	But I was wondering like, you know
qy^d	and I was wondering if you,
b	Uh huh.
b^m	Highlands ,
nn	Nope.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think a lot of things are not made as well.
sd	of course, it's hard to think of an exact example,
b	yeah,
sd	for one thing. I know their, work, you know,
sv	they want people to replace it after, a couple of years.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	My Toyota did, really well.
ba	Good.
sv	Well, I think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship.
sv	nobody cares, nobody's, really paying,
aa	Right,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	and you get satisfaction out of it.
sv	And, But you know, I think things come both from the, individual side and also from the company side
sv	because the companies that, give the attitude that, well, you know,
^q	and we don't really care about you, as an individual.
sv	When you've got that type of attitude on it, the people don't care, about their work.
sv	Little value just in whatever you do.
sv	Doing a good job of it.
sd	I live in Dallas,
sd	right at the intersection of the busiest highway in the state. And a, uh, it goes east and west, and a north south tollway.
nn	no,
sd	It's the looper that goes around the city
sd	and then, the tollway is called the Dallas North Tollway.
sd	Just moved here about a month ago after twenty one years, two miles to the east.
sd	So, it's a very different house from the typical Dallas, house.
no	It's about eight years old,
sd	it's a duplex type thing. very modern and, very open and airy light.
sd	So it's different than the long Texas ramblers.
b^m	Uh huh.
qw	What's your house like?
ba	great,
qy	So it's got a lot of openness and light, also?
qy	it doesn't?
sd	Well, that's what my wife really wanted
ny	Yeah
sd	our last house wasn't too bad,
sd	the next time, probably a year and a half from now, we're going to try to build.
sd	So make one really, contemporary and, and very modern and very open and very light.
nn	No,
sd	they usually, get back at least two of them for the summer,
na	Still need a little bit of space.
sd	Already cut back.
qw	How big is your place?
ba	 that's good size.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	So now we're down to, two and two.
b^m	Uh huh.
ny	yes.
ny	Yes,
sd	we really didn't go that route and didn't look.
aa	Yeah.
sv	But that was just the timing.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ba	For sure.
sv	And that's a good, example of it.
b	yeah.
sd	I'm from Missouri,
sd	So it's sort of home now.
sd	I'm at, it's called Brookhaven College.
sd	And it's just about two miles to the west of where I'm living.
sd	So it's very nice, very convenient.
b	Yeah.
sd	And that's about nine miles to the east of here.
fc	So, anyway, well, it's good to hear from you.
fc	And I hope we, good, on their little computer dealy.
fc	And, have a good life, the rest of it.
fc	Bye bye.
ny	Yeah.
nd	well, I don't know about that,
sd	well, computer science and cognitive science.
b	I see.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy^h	To a parent?
sv	Well, you know, the thing is, when you're a kid and the kid at that age, especially if they're going into undergraduate, it seems like they think they know what they want.
sd(^q)	and, I mean, choosing from my experience, you know, I thought, you know, I know what I want a lot more than my parents know what I want.
h	But, I don't know,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	yeah.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
t3	give me five minutes.
ny	Yeah.
qy^m	Yeah.
qw	you know, what's the trade off there,
bk	I see.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	You know, a particular institution might be better for my area
sv	yet, like, say, you know, the University of Small Town in Arkansas or something, might have some top specialists in my area.
sv	Yet, if I go to U of I or C M U or, you know, you know, any big name school, my quality of education might not be that much better,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	And, actually, in the Midwest especially, a lot of the schools like University of Missouri, will have a main campus like Columbia, which is big, multi disciplinary,
sd	and they'll have a satellite campus usually in a smaller town that specializes in the technical field.
b^m	Yeah.
b^m	Okay,
sd	Well, I don't do it as much as I should.
sd	And, last year I did it every day,
sd	And so I'm not doing it as much as I need to,
sd	But it's just to get motivated to do it,
sd	It's just to get, motivated again,
sd	And I was by myself,
sd	I haven't walked since,
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
bk	Oh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	Because I teach school,
sd	I would go faithfully,
sv	you just have to stick with it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Like it's misery loves company.
sd	I mean, it's an automatic high for her.
sd	She just enjoys it so much.
sd	I feel good after I do it,
sd	You know, I just,
sd	And, it's a daily thing for her.
sd	and I have an older sister that loves running, too,
sd	Like when I walk I'll take along a radio or something
b	Uh huh,
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah,
sv	it's great afterwards,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
aa	Exactly
b	Yeah.
qy^g	It's kind of a vicious circle isn't it?
b	Yeah,
sv	So, you know, you know, you're not only doing something to keep yourself fit, but you're probably prolonging your life.
sv	There's no reason that we shouldn't do it,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
ba	Well, that's good, too.
b	Yeah,
aa	That's right,
qy@	Well, do you have a facility right where you work? No.
b	Yeah,
ba	that's great.
b	Yeah.
aa	Uh huh.
qy	Well, do a lot of people take advantage of it?
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	you have a pool there, too?
ba	how nice.
ba	Wow.
ba	That's great.
qy	Well, does it cost money like to exercise in the weight room or to tak , to go swimming.
ba	that's not bad.
b	Huh uh.
aa	I think so too,
qy^r	People of all ages take advantage of the aerobics?
sd^t	Just recently I was kind of laughing when I heard the switchboard talking about the question because, I had to have my, radiator flushed
sd	and it was getting rusty.
nn	No,
aa	Yes,
aa	I know.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I know.
b	Uh huh.
sd	your car is fuming
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh,
aa	Yeah.
sd	because I don't know if I want to, you know, pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it's starting to breakdown.
aa	Uh huh,
h	So I don't know,
aa	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
bh	really?
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I think they get the new Z bart stuff and everything to where you can,
b	Uh huh.
bh	Do you?
b	Uh huh,
sd	Well, I think I'm getting too old for all that.
aa	Absolutely, absolutely.
aa	And yeah,
b^m	And yeah,
aa	Yes,
fc^t	I didn't, I didn't set the time or anything to,
fc	Yeah,
fc	Well, yeah,
aa	Okay.
na	I think so.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
qy	You think you prefer the jury?
aa	Well, that's true.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, sometimes the sentencing is not fair.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh .
b	Right.
bh	really?
b^m	Yeah.
sv	But, the thing is too, maybe they need I don't know, more of a expert types to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, you know, Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever and call them in.
aa	exactly.
aa	Right,
b	Yeah.
o@	Uh huh. putting on a act or whatever. / * slash error should be ^2
na	I have two cats. and, and two fish.
qw	And what do you have?
b	no.
bk	Ooh.
o@	Right. Does he sleep in your house?
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
ba	my word.
ba	dear.
^2	Good bye .
sd	I love my cats.
sd	I had one cat for eighteen years.
sd	Before I even got married I had my cat.
sd	Well, I had to have her put to sleep last June.
na	it was awful,
sd	and she just sat there on my lap, you know.
sd	She just waited
sd	it was awful.
sd	but the bad thing was, though, she would pee in my husband's shoes.
sd	You know, and she just liked his shoes
sd	it was just bad.
sd	it was terrible.
sv	She must have known he didn't like her or something.
sd	and I would bar the closet doors, and would vac , clean the carpets
sv	dear, it was just awful.
sd	That was very funny.
sd	well, I have two cats right now.
na	They sleep with my kids.
sd	no, I I'm not going to have a dog.
sd	We've had two dogs
sd	were just my kids' friends,
sd	It was awful.
sd	And it's too heartbreaking
b	Ooh.
sd	I wouldn't want a Lab.
b	Oh.
b	yeah.
b	Sure.
ar	No,
sd	somebody's trying to cut in on my line
sd	I'll just wait.
b	No,
sd	I hate to cut it off,
ad	so we'll just wait.
sv	Whoever it is will call back.
sd	Well, it's somebody calling for my kids, you know,
sd	Actually, it's my son,
nn	No
sd^e	just regular water.
ny	yeah,
nn	no not, no,
sd	it was around there generally.
sd	that's where the family grew.
ny	Yeah,
sd	so. it was a big deal,
sd	We rent a pavilion and do that
ng	I have not gone back lately.
qy^d^h	Not getting to go.
sd	just, the distance involved
sd	I have a younger daughter now
sd	But I am going to, hopefully next year get to go back, cause, a lot of the family on her side, my mother's side, has not seen, you know, my daughter,
sd	I have one brother,
ny	Yes.
na	Right,
na	Right, I usually see her a, couple times a year
sd	father's.
sd	So, it was a large reunion of, of that group, from that descendants.
sd	And, a lot of those people have,
sd	And now it has gotten, that, a lot of those people have, have died off,
sd	And so, it's not quite as close as it used to be.
sd	you know, those were all brothers and sisters a lot
sd	You know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, you know, they were all located together, in one small community.
sd	And as time grew, I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth.
sd	but that's just how it is.
b	Well, yeah.
sv	It's more of you know, a smaller unit,
b	Right,
sd	I mean, I used to enjoy going,
sd	it's going just for the sake of getting together,
nn	no,
sd	but I feel closer to them, because I kind of grew up with them.
sd	you know, and generally when I was growing up a lot of those people, the only time I ever saw them was at the reunion,
sd	you do not really feel that really close to them.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's a good idea.
b	Right.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
fp	Hi,
fp	Good.
sd	I'm ready whenever you are.
qw	So, what are your thoughts on the subject there?
aa	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sv	and simple majority won't do.
aa	Yeah,
sv	And there's always that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason, you know.
aa	Yeah .
b	Yeah.
sd	but I mean even now I know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that
sv	I mean, jeez if the judge was doing it himself, without any checks and balances whose to say.
aa	Yeah
bk	Okay.
sd	One of them just got his law degree.
sd	I really haven't studied it in depth.
b	Yeah.
aa	I'm sure of it.
sv	it's kind of weird.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it's pretty amazing.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Like this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious
b	Yeah.
sd	See, you're from California,
bk	okay.
sv	Pretty strange.
sd	But, that friend of mine's telling me that I might have to go in as a witness.
aa	Yeah.
sv	and we already have too many lawyers as it is.
aa	Yeah.
sd	I, I'm originally from Florida
sd	I'm not real sure what the,
aa	yeah,
sd	and, and, I know I'm a real, out of it in terms of taxes
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
ar	I don't, I don't know about that,
b	I see.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	Whereas in, in Dallas here we've got, those patterns were well established before we really tried to do the DART.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yep.
b	Yeah.
fc	Yeah,
fc	Good enough.
fc^m	Bye.
sd	Well, they've, statewide raises,
na	Right.
qo	how do you feel about taxes?
b	Oh.
sd	I've never seen taxes really go down.
b	Oh.
sd	I hope they put that in writing .
sv	I feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation and, that the rich are not paying their share
qy	You think the rich are paying too much?
sd	Well, I don't know many rich that don't have enough tax breaks to,
b	Right.
aa	Now I'll go along with that. You know,
aa	Right.
sv	no ifs, ands and buts, you know,
sd	Our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal.
sd	And, they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate.
sd	and, and you withhold no matter what you do,
aa	Right,
sd	but it's been that way for the last probably ten years.
aa	Right,
sv	But, you know, if you have a lot of federal deduction, it ends up hurting you state wise.
sv	And you end up owing, you know,
sv	And, it's just ridiculous.
sd	I mean twenty five percent increase.
sd	Well, most of the stuff up until now, in the recent months, I, I don't have any problem with.
aa	No,
sv	In fact, it really was to begin with.
sd	And, I heard a comment on the radio this morning that, you know, it gets to a point where, if enough people are going to be slaughtered over there over the, the internal problems, somebody may step in again.
sv	But, I really think it's a U N issue, at that point because it is internal.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right,
aa	Absolutely right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
sv	Some of them have been going on for tens of years, if I understand it right in places like the Sudan and,
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
aa	that's absolutely right.
aa	Yeah,
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Uh huh.
sv	and, you know, by self proclamation this is a holy war
sv	And then, we go on from there
b	Yeah,
aa	That's right.
aa	Uh huh,
aa	Absolutely.
b	Uh huh.
ba	You bet.
sv	there's different value placed on human life, right down the list, you know, possessions and everything else.
sv	And, what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases.
b	Okay.
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
ba	I believe it.
aa	Yeah,
aa	That's probably true,
b	Uh huh.
aa	No,
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
aa	Uh huh,
aa	Absolutely.
ny	That's right, yes.
na	Right,
b	Uh huh.
sv	And, it, it bites us over and over
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	well, they're coming from various places,
b	Okay.
b	I see.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Sure,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Absolutely.
aa	That's right.
aa	Yeah,
sv	And the long range views are just kind of, become a thing of the past.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No,
b	Okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Absolutely.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it's, it's obsolete,
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
aa	That's right.
b	Okay,
b	okay.
b	Yeah.
sv	And, if it does the job, then that's what you need.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	It's a two bedroom, two baths duplex.
sd	Brick and,
nn	No,
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh,
nn	No,
sd	Ours is, too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	wow.
bf	You all are cramped .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	That's what we'd like to do.
na	it's a wonderful place to live,
b	Uh huh.
ng	I don't think so,
na	of course, those are my kids
sd	I have two dogs.
ny	Yeah,
sd	They're my babies.
sd	kind of a mauve and gray.
ny	Uh huh,
sd	I'm a cow nut .
b	Uh huh
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
ba	sounds pretty.
b	Oh.
aa	Uh huh,
ba	Good.
sv	That's an important factor there .
sd	Well, you know, now we have that new mall in Lewisville
sd	and that's just like a mile or two from our house
sd	but, when we first moved to Coppell, it's what, six years ago, we didn't even have a grocery store
sd	and now we have four
sd	and Coppell's not really big enough to support four grocery stores
aa	much very much.
sd	In fact, it's about the size now,
sd	and Coppell's now about the size that Lewisville was when, when I moved down here.
b	Uh huh.
b	really,
sd	All set.
ad	Sure, go ahead.
qy	Do they have many buildings that have security there?
b	Yeah,
sd	And, it didn't seem like it was that congested in that part.
sd	and the cities are very populated with tenement housing, where there are more than one family in a house. with the, people that are coming into the country from other countries, not knowing the language
sv	and, they're going to the big cities.
sv	It really does,
h	And, I don't know,
ba	that, that's really sad, you know,
b	Yeah.
aa	It is
sv	And I really think that we're falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people.
aa	Yeah, exactly.
sd	in fact on the news last night we were watching this, man who lost his ten year old daughter.
sd	And while he was gone, he had went looking for a job and stopped at the store,
sd	And one of the men got, I think it was seventeen years
sd	The one that was in for the seventeen years, actually served seven,
sd	And the man said, that, you know, if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail, that he would eliminate this person himself. And then go to McDonalds and have a hamburger and not think a thing about it.
sv	And I mean, I think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands. And that innocent people,
sv	I shouldn't say innocent, because I mean, actually if they commit a crime that they're in the same circumstances
sv	the reasons that they're doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it, you know, it's like two different things.
sv	Sometimes when you lose someone that you really love, you do some crazy things
sv	I like the idea that, if someone is from a foreign country, and they come to this country and commit, a crime, I think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything, they should be immediately deported.
sv	Especially if they're found guilty of the crime.
sv	You know, once they have been arrested
sv	That's it,
sv	I mean they go right back where they came from.
aa	Exactly
sv	But the , they're, so close,
sv	Like you take Asian countries, or, the Eastern countries where women are like in the foreground, in the background and the men are in the foreground,
sv	and it's like, you know, they live back in where we came from two hundred years ago.
sv	You know, we've advanced beyond that,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	Wow.
ba	Wow.
sv	it would get snatched right off your arm .
aa	sure.
ba	That's amazing,
sd	I believe in the death penalty,
b	Yeah,
sv	and we take the, civil liberties, stuff too far.
sv	You know like people that are in prison, I mean we didn't put them there.
sv	And as far as like them, entertaining the rights that they should have.
sv	I mean, we educate them,
sd	I'm not saying they're all bad,
sv	I think that they should be put away.
^2	Get rid of them.
sd	Or, if they're in there and they've got seventeen years and they're on good behavior, for every year they're in they get so many less, you know, that they don't serve the full penalty.
sv	I, I really think we're going to far overboard with all of this.
aa	Yeah,
sv	I think it's too easy for them.
sv	That if the laws, and were, were harsher and were enforced,
sv	I mean you have to set an example.
sv	And I think that people know that they're going to get a slap on the wrist, they might serve a little bit of time and that they'll be out on the street again.
sv	it, an I feel bad for the policeman, because he's out there every day facing these people. this craziness, you know, people with, automatic weapons and, all this other stuff and trying to do a job
ad	and let's face it,
sv	Twenty thousand dollars a year, if they're lucky.
aa	it really is.
sv	You know, and I'm not saying that they're all good either, because there's good and bad in everything,
sv	but they're already, have three strikes against them when they're out there.
sv	Because they'll arrest someone and, you know, go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this, and having all kinds of evidence
sd	Well, my home at the moment is an apartment.
ny	Yeah .
sd	So, I own a home in Pensacola,
sd	my home well, is typical for the area.
sd	But it's upper middle class, kind of an environment.
sd	It's a two story colonial, which my wife and I designed.
sd	it has around thirty two hundred square feet. five bedrooms and so forth and so on,
sd	and I would imagine in terms of, of size and so forth, it's relatively typical for the area.
sd	And, but based, you know, in terms of, you know, in Pensacola, in that area of Florida it's what now,
b	Yeah.
sd	in terms of cost and, and size and so forth, it,
sd	when we built it ten years ago, it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars.
sd	So, I would have really, I haven't really priced, you know, in the market,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	I thought that was on the upswing again now.
bk	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh .
sd	Well, Pensacola has
sd	And it isn't because of the, well,
sd	but, I'm sure people you know, in, Galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it,
sd	And home porting was a possibility a few years ago.
sd	They were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the Navy,
sd	a new carrier was coming in and, the, attendant, support vessels.
na	it is.
sd	overbuilding has been a real problem there.
qo	What about your home?
bk	Uh huh.
bk	Uh huh.
sd	Nor do we,
bk	Uh huh.
bk	Uh huh.
bk	Right.
sd	Well, the housing here in Maryland is just atrocious. And in the entire D C area.
nn	No,
sd	Sevren is east, near the eastern shore,
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's not unusual, yeah.
sd	And so, I was just looking,
ny	Yes.
sv	I guess you pay the piper
sd	it's not unusual, for example, for somewhere around here on a, on a,
sd	but that same house here, you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year, taxes on it.
sd	So, it's, so, the question of whether to buy here or move to another county, say, drive twenty more miles north, buy a condominium for approximately, the same price, maybe a little lower,
na	absolutely. Yeah,
sd	it's really sad .
sd	this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country.
sd	Well, , it, the, their, they do have an extremely good, such things as extremely good school systems, for example.
sd	because the cost of living around here is so high,
sd	public employees make great salaries around here .
sd	I was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the, Montgomery County Public Schools makes,
sd	by administrator I think I mean,
fp^m	Hello
fp^m	Hi.
fp	I'm Sandy.
bh	really?
ny	Yes.
ny	Yeah.
na	Okay,
b	Yeah.
sd	So am I.
sv	You know, I think it's kind of coming back around to that, don't you,
h	I don't know,
sv	I don't think that you can have, I mean, there's no way I could have a career and then be the kind of mom that I want to be
sv	and to me that's more important.
sd	Two.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	Five and two.
aa	Well, I agree,
sv	or, if they wouldn't be able to make ends meet not working or whatever,
sv	I mean, I think it's got to be a personal choice,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
b	Yeah .
sv	and they realize there's a need for that,
sd	Well, done a little, repair on the, shingles on the roof recently.
ny	Yes.
nd	We've been getting quite a bit, maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around San Antonio,
sd	and there are parts of downtown or near downtown Dallas that are under water right now, I guess,
nd	Well, we're north and, about, I don't know, eighty to a hundred miles south of the Oklahoma line, I guess.
ng	we did have a little bit of rain yesterday.
sd	so I guess I'll let it go awhile.
nn	no,
b	Yeah .
nn	No,
sd	So, it's a small problem so far,
qy^d	then you don't have to do too much with it .
b	Uh huh.
sd	it's pretty steep.
sd	Well, you wear, shoes with good traction, and, and try to remember where you are at all times .
sd	And remember to yell Geronimo, if all else fails.
sd	It's actually just twelve years old, now.
aa	Yeah,
sd	the main thing that we've had with this house recently has been some, squirming, I call it, of the foundation.
sd	but, the soil right under this is a clay,
nd	Well, depending on it's moisture content, it either swells up or shrinks,
sd	and so during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation from, drooping
sd	but anytime there's a change in the weather, like the temperature, drastic changes in temperature or in, moisture, you get little spider web cracks all around, windows and doors.
sd	Well, usually what you do is just wait until you think it's stopped,
nd	well, it's all drywall
sd	I think, with,
ny	yeah,
sd	But, somehow or other that does manage to, show these little cracks.
ny	Yeah,
sd	I expect that's what it is,
b	Yeah,
aa	Yes,
ng	Generally, I don't think they are.
sv	They don't ever have to go out and get a real job.
qh	you know what I mean?
sv	I think by putting term limitations on you could slow down some of the problems.
sv	but it has to be not just at the national level but at you know, the state and the local level, too.
sv	they've never had a job.
sv	you know, they get paid a hundred and twenty five grand a year. Which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit
sd(^q)	and, you know, I'm going, like, I don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than I am
sv	and they work you know, less than I do.
aa	I think that's true,
sv	I mean, that's true of the Presidency, too,
sv	I mean, there is a lot to learn,
sv	I think it would have to be extended, you know,
sv	we aren't tackling a massive ballot every four years.
aa	Uh huh.
sv	the C I A is moving out to West Virginia which is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency.
sv	the world does not revolve around West Virginia as far as this country is concerned,
sv	and the C I A is a very large, very high profile agency and to have it located out in West Virginia,
sv	and, you know, it's a, I think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that
t1	or is it the F B I.
aa	Yeah,
sv	I mean, we all know that that's not necessarily true.
sv	But I think that, with all the perks that we've given them,
sd	one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks.
b	Uh huh,
bk	Okay,
b	Uh huh.
bk	Oh.
sd	well, excuse me, well I'm a electronics tech.
sd	So, I learned to repair one
aa	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, space is a handicap with me,
sd	And I'm preparing for retirement.
sd	And I'm not to far from it another year and a half.
aa	Yes,
sd	remember how they started out running three, four hundred dollars.
na	I mean calculators,
bh	You're kidding.
qy	Including a printer?
qy	A hundred?
ba	Wholly smoke,
sd	Well, see of not being particularly interested I don't keep track of prices on them,
b	Uh huh.
qy	Well, what is a good brand a inexpensive.
b	Uh huh.
ba	wow.
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
sd	Well, anyway that's one ever my favorite jokes.
sd	One and one equals ten.
sv	Course it's kind of an inside joke, you know.
sv	You can only tell that to somebody who understands binary.
qy	do you, work with a computers at T I?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
sd	I keep track of an inventory here.
sv	And of course now that is where a computer is very handy.
sd	And, well it's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated.
sd	See I'm with the Q R A lab. Qualification and evaluation
sd	so naturally our equipment has to be in top condition and is constantly calibrated,
sd	and they're dated.
sd	I just run a printout every week
sd	it is handy.
sd	And I must admit that up until I did start using one, I had very little interest in computers.
sv	But they are amazing.
fc	Yeah,
fc	Good luck to you.
b	Okay,
sd	so he spends time doing that with him, planning and, practicing outside.
sd	he's a real sports kind of person,
sd	We take turns with her.
sd	We don't have H B O.
sd	my kids have a Nintendo which they play,
sd	my little girl, Jennifer, likes to do crafty things,
sd	he gets home from work late or whatever
b	,
na	It is hard because, you know, at the end of your day you want time for yourself
sd	and that's kind of cutting into your time.
sd	And with the kids getting older, now on the weekends they get to the bed like at ten which really is late,
sd	but, you know, on school nights, the two older ones get to bed about nine.
sd	Maybe Brian will still be up, and spend some time with him.
nn	no,
sd	That was two days a week,
sd	but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way I want it kept, it is hard.
sd	Even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything.
sd	And that's another thing,
sd	And then, of course, they have a pretty, busy social calendar too .
sd	You fit it in with all that.
sv	I think a lot of people set their kids in front of the T V and H B O and rent movies and, kind of leave them to their own means.
sv	I think, you know, it's very easy to fall into that trap,
sv	But, I think different parts of the country,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I have a friend that's a nurse
sv	that's a great career.
sd	because she has such a flexible schedule,
sv	Well, I think it's a big, responsibility.
sv(^q)	When you have children, you have to say, now, this is different
sd	Well, me being from Texas ,
qy^d	I hope you're ready for this.
sd	Well, I'm not your stereotypical Texan.
sd	So I don't have a fear of fire arms in any respect.
sd	I respect them and what their capabilities are.
sd	And on top of that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military, as a Green Beret, I definitely respect the power of weaponry.
sd	And here in Houston, as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country,
qy^d	When I mean, you've heard the slogan, if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns.
sv	well, any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs
sv	And they get out their little Mac tens,
sv	Since I am a law abiding citizen and I have never had a felony, if I wanted to buy one, I don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it.
sd	If they want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that I've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county, that's fine too.
sv(^q)	well, the criteria the sheriff would have to follow is this guy a convicted felon?
^q	and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems.
sv	if they want the firepower they can get it.
b	okay.
sd	I'd said about an eight.
sd	I said the restrictions I would like to see for anybody, whether it being for handgun, a rifle, a shotgun,
sv	in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as the weapon, as a pistol.
ng	not necessarily a price thing.
b	Okay.
qy	L A area?
bk	Okay.
sv	And all these people come around,
sd	Now if this legislation comes through,
sd	we've gone shopping,
sv	Then it's still equally matched.
sd	If I'm, at the same, time.
sv	it's more of a police action in itself,
sv	Now whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not, that's another trip,
sd	In defense of myself, defense of my family or defense of my friends I can blow somebody a way in a heart beat. even more so when it comes to my wife and son.
sv	Anybody, anybody tries to hurt them I won't even blink,
sv	this is where the question of gun control comes in.
sv	What, I consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot.
sd	all of a sudden my combat in me goes up
sd	And I make sure this persons sees it so that he's got now doubt that I will use it on him
sv(^q)	If he doesn't back up at that point he deserves what he gets because I have sent the clearest signal you mess with me, you mess with my family, I'm going to dust you.
sd	Well, if I'm the one doing the shooting I don't miss.
na	I think I am.
ny	Yeah,
sd	but unfortunately the house is taking up my time.
sd	So it's been almost a year, I guess, since I've actually, swung a club for a purpose.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
ba	that's great.
b	Yeah.
sd	and, I think that's probably going to be one of the next investments, is get her a set of clubs
b	Really.
ba	Well, great.
b	Yeah,
b	Right,
b	Uh huh,
sd	I've got the same attitude.
sd	And, I took it as a P E course and then kind of left it alone for a while,
sd	and since then, we've made it,
sd	that's back in South Dakota where I grew up
sd	so that's, that's been my main involvement,
sd	and then I'll show them we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yep,
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sv	it's, it's a lot of fun, especially if you can find somebody that's got the same level of interest.
sv	that's true of any sport, you know.
aa	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	That's true.
aa	That's true.
b	Well.
aa	that's, that's so.
aa	Yeah,
sv	After a short period, once you learn everything they've got to offer,
sd	But, eventually I'd like to work up, if my wife does get interested, and maybe get involved in a, in a mixed doubles league, or something like that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Right.
ba	Well, that's good that's good, that's sounds like a lot of fun.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	I, I go home, I've gone home every year now since I've moved to Dallas to go pheasant hunting,
sd	and, kind of the same situation.
sv	but, it's interesting,
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right,
sd	and I keep rationalizing that well, you know, I can do it,
sv	it, it really works that way .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Sure.
b	Sure.
fc	Okay,
fc	Okay.
fc	Bye.
ny	Yeah,
sd	we just got the dog less than a year ago
sd	He's a mixed breed,
ny	Yeah.
sd	He's got little spots on them.
qy	Was the guinea pig for your, for your child?
bh	Really?
sd	my husband's always wanted a Chow
sd	because we thought they would socialize easier,
sd	my husband had originally wanted an
sd	And the people that he got the from, used to have cats
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	but I wouldn't feel, hesitant about bringing a puppy in, to adult cats,
sv	I think they would socialize easier.
qw	how old is your child?
bh^m	Five?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	What color are they?
qy^d	I bet the black one's pretty.
qy^d	About your baby.
b	Yeah,
sv	But I think it really helps them to understand when they go to other people's houses
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
bh	Are they?
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, we've thought about getting an aquarium, partly for the cats,
sd	I think the cats would really enjoy it,
aa	yeah,
sv	and they're so, expensive to start up.
b	Yeah.
sv	most of them really aren't that pretty,
sd	you know, I really don't care much for them.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	I have to be real careful about where I put things,
sd	if the cats will jump up on things and knock things over all the time,
sd	They're always up where they're not supposed to be.
sv	that's just like kids, you know,
b	Yeah,
sd	and now, it's like a major production, trying to find somebody to take care of the dog while you're gone.
sd	we knew it,
^q	let's take him home.
sd	You know, and then the first weekend we had him we were in a two bedroom apartment,
sd	and my husband went out of town, and left me with the brand new puppy,
sd	and I had to work twelve hours that day,
sd	and so, I left the dog locked in the bedroom
sd	and he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door,
nd	Well, I had the carpet fixed,
sd	yeah, I didn't even tell the apartment manager, who got it.
sd	But that was my first real experience with a puppy
sd	and I wasn't really involved in the paper training, and, you know, teaching him commands and stuff
sd	so, this was, to me, a whole new experience.
sd	Only it wasn't like cats at all.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	My cats do that it.
sd	anything that they think is good,
sd	and then it doesn't matter where you put it and where you hide it,
sd	and how tight you have the lid down on it,
sd(^q)	And the cat's just looking at me like, sorry.
^q	I couldn't help myself.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	but he's still chewing.
sd	the last thing he chewed up was, when we ...
sd	I haven't had that much, of course
sv	using your Social Security number, of course, permits people to do that
sd	and almost anything you do now, a Social Security number is required.
sd	And, of course there's another aspect of this, too, in terms of invasion of privacy
sv	And not only that, it opens you to phone solicitations
sd@	and I've noticed more and more I would say over the last six months / * slash error one utt with b.26
sd@	I am getting more at home phone solicitations for a variety of things from,
sd	I've had them for carpet cleaning,
sd	you know, you get, please send in you know, this particular card and you get, a free trip or something along those lines.
sd	And so, that bothers me because of course, I enjoy being at home and I do not enjoy getting called by strangers particularly you know, soliciting.
sd	and I know that a lot of these, of course, are random phone calls
sd	they just, you know, start going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers,
sd	But they have one under, you know, my first name, James.
sd	then they have a third one under just my two initials.
sd	, and I get mail here at home under each of those names.
sd	So I know that they have sold their mailing list.
sd	And, I think those two things bother me more than anything else as far as an invasion of privacy.
sd	And, I can't really think of anything else offhand, that,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I think you mentioning the phone calls during dinner,
sd	I actually during that period of time you know, usually from six o'clock or six thirty, whenever I get home, until eight or so, I will shut off the phone
sd	and, my daughter gets irate , when I do that because, you know, she's a teenager
^q@	why are you cutting off the phone, * slash error I might get an important phone call,
aa	That's right.
sd	Well now we have a, you know, voice mail system at the office.
sd	Now what I have done is, I have forwarded my home phone to the answering service at the office so that I do not have to have a, a ring at all. if I want to do that.
sd	or I will just let the phone ring three or four times and know that it will forward to the office.
sd	And so you know, it makes it convenient.
sd	And when I want to be, you know, not bothered during the day, that's exactly what I do.
ny	Yeah,
sd	Except we call it Aspen.
ny	Yes.
b	Yeah,
sd	And so, we had been using the Aspen service before they purchased Tigon
sd	so I imagine we will be, shifting over to that service or if, in a while . As soon as we determine what we're going to do with Contel after we bought Contel .
aa	All right.
fc	well thank you for calling.
fc	Take care.
sd	So probably everything I going to say is kind of dated.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
aa	So, yeah,
qy	Did you all ever watch that?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Right,
aa	I know,
sd	So, you know, it was prime time,
sd	and we have cable,
sd	you know, I mean, it wasn't even funny
sd	it wasn't creative,
qh	You know what I'm saying.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
aa	Right,
sv	But now, in order to seem, you know, humane and normal, we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff.
sv	But it's, just one of those things, you know,
sv	I don't understand why, first of all, the public puts up with it. Second of all, why the networks think that, you know, we enjoy that kind of stuff.
sv	It's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that.
sv	It must be the marketing pressures,
ba	I know.
qh^m	Why do you do this?
aa	I know,
sd	Stuff I guess that mostly public, on public T V.
sd	As a matter of fact, you know when I was a kid, excuse me, my parents used to have,
sd	That was just the rule.
sd	So we had to give a little oral report before we could watch our program.
qy	do you watch sports on T V?
b	Yeah .
b	Right,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Saved a lot of time that way.
sv	But, that takes too much planning.
sv	Now yeah, is that still real good.
aa^m	Is it.
b	Oh .
b	okay.
b	Yeah.
aa	Right,
b^m	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	It's getting harder and harder.
aa	Yeah,
sv	But it's real different show than it was when it started.
sv	It's funny now,
sv	But you can't be outrageous.
sv	You know, if you keep that same format.
aa	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
fc	Yeah,
fc	Take care.
fc^m	Bye.
b	Uh huh.
na	sure.
qy	Do you really believe that?
b	Yeah.
qw	What kind of newspaper do you get down there?
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
qy	Is, Is this, is this one with some company that services you and takes your calls and all that stuff?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qw	And what if a burglar comes along and cuts your phone line?
qw	How does it do that?
b	Uh huh.
aa	Sure.
ny	Well, yeah,
sv	I think it's the murder capital of the country now.
ny	Yes.
aa	Absolutely.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qh	s , so, what's the solution?
sv	And all these politicians make hay over, you know being anticrime,
sv	but they haven't seemed to have changed anything.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
qw	What do you use yours for mostly?
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and data base,
sd	you don't have to make a hard copy that way.
qy	are you using windows?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	But I don't have any real programming capabilities on my, Mac right now.
sd	I don't have, any compilers
sd	I use it in my business.
sd	I, do, consultation and testing of various kinds for, English as a second language programs.
sd	yeah, that's the kind of thing I'm working with exactly.
sv	You seem to be, better informed than the average person on that.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
sd	Most of the stuff that I do is not, interactive
sd	and I use it for data analysis on testing,
nd	Well, actually, just, item analysis, statistical analysis of the tests,
sd	You know, when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is,
sd	you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort.
sd	Well, I was doing some of the same stuff, but doing it more slowly , and with smaller files.
sd	and on my two E I had a hundred twenty eight K .
b	Yeah.
qy^g	the old the old Apple, the original Apple had, forty eight I guess, didn't it.
ba	My goodness.
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well the S P thirty goes up to eight
sd	but I haven't upgraded it quite that far yet.
qw	what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation?
b	Yeah.
aa	Uh huh.
sv	So, I had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays it's a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids.
^2	Always home by the time you got home.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it seems that there's a grass roots, effort or whatever going on
sd	and almost all the people that I clean for, believe it or not, are mothers that don't work .
sv	and it's, I think it's kind of a new movement
sv	And I think that in the future you're, I think you're going to see a lot more, women choosing to not work after they have a baby.
sv	I think the work force with the salaries that
sd	I don't see it as much, like in my situation where I don't have children yet,
b	Uh huh.
sv	You know, it's going to kind of go along with the B M W in the driveway or in the garage or whatever.
sv	and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever.
aa	Yeah,
sd	one of the women is real active with, Muscular Dystrophy. And, does a lot of work with them on a volunteer basis
aa	Yeah.
sd	I would like to be able to do that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	where the attitudes were a lot different.
sv	I think morally, it seems like people were a lot better back then as far as higher standards.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	And I think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future.
b	Uh huh.
qy	do you think there's going to be still a family unit
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
ba	That's pretty sad.
sv	I think in the long run though your child will benefit from that.
sv	And it will make the strain worthwhile.
fc	it was really nice talking to you.
fc	And, thanks a lot.
fc	Okay,
sv	That's not a bad idea
sv	and it's another form of sentencing.
sv	But on that one thing, I still think it should be a unanimous decision,
sv	I think we're getting to the point now where they're going to eventually let it be, majority vote.
b^m	No.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Sure .
b	Yeah .
b	Oh .
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sv	Well, we definitely need a change in the system
aa^m	It's not working, too .
sv	It's just piling up on us.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sv	We're just a society not willing to spend the time or the money to do what it takes,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Sure.
b	Yeah.
aa^m	Very serious, yeah.
b	yeah ,
aa	Sure.
ba	You bet .
b	Yeah.
aa	I do too.
ba	Well, good.
fc^m	Bye bye.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
ad	Well, it might be a good time for you to, to start a tradition.
ad	You could be responsible for that yourself.
b	Sure.
sd	Well, in my family, let's see, last October was the forty fifth annual reunion.
sd	The first Sunday in October, the Jordan family gets together.
sd	And all of the descendants of I mean, yeah, the Civil War veterans come together,
sd	there's a big community hall in Vernon Texas,
sd	and, that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the Texas family.
ny	Uh huh.
na	Right,
sd	all of his direct descendants have now died
sd	well, I took them up until this year,
^h	But, let's see,
nd	Well, it's a community hall.
sd	and, you just bring the covered dishes.
nd	Well, we try to stay away from those things which might have, salmonella in them.
sd	And we choose to bring congealed salad.
sd	And most of us are very conscious of, of, sanitation aspects, whatever you've got to carry for any distance.
sd	I always, take home baked bread.
sd	that happens to be my specialty for that family.
sd	but there are others in the family who do them better.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
nd	we have, kind of a core group that serves as, quote, officers of the organization,
sd	and they plan the reunions,
sd	We have a biographer who continues every year to save clippings on any family member,
sd	And they're very dedicated to that,
sv	And it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging.
sd	And I got to talking to him,
sd(^q)	I said, "Hey, wouldn't you like to know what's happening with these people?"
sd	Liked to kill me, because I didn't have that group cooperation,
sd	And, nobody brought covered dishes.
sd	and, it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping.
sd	We did it that year,
sd	and it was difficult to hold them together.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qo	well, what's there to say?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	that was the one that was used so much in the campaign. in the presidential race.
qy^t	Anyway, well the question is, you know, do you think, it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime
b	Uh huh .
aa	Yeah.
sv	The police don't catch them,
b	Yeah.
sd	Last year it was D C,
b	Uh huh .
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	I mean, I personally think life imprisonment,
sv(^q)	So any, anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole, I'd say, give them the death penalty .
aa	Yeah,
sv	And I think our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are.
sv	and that way we can be sure, you know,
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
bf	Just started shooting people, because they botched the first job
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qw	So what was the verdict,
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	the penalty phase,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	I've never been on a jury,
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
sd	And the people I'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life.
sd(^q)	these are the kind of people I would like to get out of here and get out of circulation and say we don't accept your kind in our society.
b	Uh huh.
qy	do you work around children when you work?
b^m	With computers.
bk	Okay,
b	Uh huh.
qy	Does the company you work for have, child care on premises for, employees?
ba	my.
qy^d	A sabbatical .
b^m	yeah,
b	Right.
b	Right.
sv	I think it does when they are real little
sv	and you just miss the little things,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
aa	That's right.
b	Right.
aa	Right.
b	Right.
sd	And they took infants starting at six weeks,
sd	and, they have different things they will put them down on the floor,
sd	and there's something about their eyes.
qw	How old is she?
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
^2	A little older .
aa	It is because that's when they are clinging to mama,
sv	so you might have a real problem with that.
ba	But that's unusual.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
sd	You know, I like that,
sv	but if, you do not have to put them in child care, that's an ideal situation for you, is to stay with them
sv	that's wonderful for the child.
aa	Right .
aa	Uh huh,
ba	that would be wonderful.
aa	Uh huh,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I do too.
^2	Really well trained people.
sv	and have some kind of real good program, set up so that when you go you can be assured that if there's an emergency that person in charge knows C P R or first aid
sv	or, and have some kind of program set up, like you say, to stimulate the kids, or educate them in some manner. And have the, you know, the right toys and the right setting and, have, an organized type of program set up so that the kids have a schedule, you know,
sv	that's real important to little kids.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	And that's a problem,
aa	Right.
sv	so a judge, you're right, should have the whole dossier of the criminal there
sv	and if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better position to give an appropriate, sentencing.
b	Uh huh.
qy	there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial?
nd	I, I don't,
sv	I would tend, myself, to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a, one of the parties wants one.
sv	And usually it is the defendant, I guess, that wants to have the jury hear the case.
sv	So I'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we, take that, you know,
bk	okay.
aa	Right.
sv	I think, that you can waive the right to a, jury trial
aa	so. I agree that that should be encouraged.
sv	People should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, in the case of, civil, things, I think maybe the use of the jury is very, often to the lawyer's advantage
sv	it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience , as possible
sv	I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that.
qy	Have you ever had to serve jury duty?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	we rendered a verdict
sd	And that was here in Wisconsin.
b	All right.
qw^d	Well, what kind of car would I want to buy.
no	I don't know.
sv	If I had all the money I wanted, then that's whole different matter.
sd	But, I don't know if I'd want one of those now.
sd	Of course I would want one if somebody was was given to me.
sd	But I maybe would buy a B M W. or even a Volvo.
sd	I've got a Dodge Daytona.
sd	It's actually the first car we ever bought new.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
qw	what rental agent did you go to to actually rent to rent those kind of cars.
br^m	To what, AVIS?
bh	Really.
b	Huh.
bk	I see.
b	Right.
qy^d	You work for a big company, then.
bk^m	T I, I see.
sv	one thing I really liked about the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have, this seven year warranty.
sd	and it really saved us some big money once.
ny	Yeah,
sd	and the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars,
aa	Yeah,
sd	Well, we bought the the extension and, at the time we bought it it was like, you know, I don't know, four hundred and twenty five dollars or something extra.
aa	Yeah,
sd	But, we still have like, you know, three years left on it.
ba	no.
qy^2	Bumper?
ba	Well, that was good.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	I'm not certain,
sd	But, I have, I have never had,
sd	And so, I bought a used Yugo just to be a you know, little car that I could care less about
sd	well, it's worked.
no	I mean, that's exactly what it is, you know,
sd	and, It's actually kind of fun to drive.
sd	it's like too mushy,
sd	you know, you feel like you're in a boat or something, you know,
b	Oh.
ny	Yes.
ny	yes.
sd	And I camp at least one weekend
sv	I'd say I camp quite a bit.
sd	Well, we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping
sd	and we also, carry all our equipment with us
sd	and so we canoe down the river and then, sleep on the river on one of the, sand bars and then get up the next morning, cook our breakfast, and go down the river again.
qo	How about yourself?
ba	Well, that's good.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Great.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It doesn't get very cold in Texas,
sd	We just use trail tarps.
sd	it's just a piece of material that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent like a,
sd	they're very light weight
sd	so you carry them with you,
b	Uh huh.
ny	yes,
b	Uh huh,
sd	But we got to see a lot of deer out and about
sd	of course, we see smaller animals all the time,
qy	Do you know what armadillo is?
b	Uh huh.
sd	And possums, and, raccoons.
sd	And we have those creatures down here that they like to go hunting for a midnight snack.
sd	And so that, that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away.
sd	They will if you attack them.
sd	But most time they run away from you if they see you're up, you know
sd	but they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep.
na	We have one.
ny	Yes,
ng	I don't use it as much as my children and my husband do.
sd	We have an I B M compatible.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
na	Right,
bk	okay,
ny	Yes.
bk	okay.
ba	Uh oh.
b	okay.
qw	where do you work?
bh	you do?
ba	well, of course.
ba	Of course.
bk	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've heard that people that finally learn how to use it really like it.
ba	That's great.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I have a question.
qy^t	Do I start calling in myself
na	Right,
bk^m	only one a day.
b	Right.
bk	I see.
bk^m	we both do.
na	Right,
ba	Well, that's a pretty good deal.
qy	So why are we doing this?
sd	Actually, I'm doing this but, you know, for a friend of mine.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's wonderful.
bk	I see,
ba	Wonderful.
sv	and I think that I don't.
qw	And you're in what city?
bk	Okay,
sd	And that's right outside of,
ba	How about that.
sd	And then I have a sister that lives in Austin.
sd	Well, we're actually all from Nebraska.
b	Yeah,
ny	Actually, yes,
ng	I think they just send Christmas letters on it.
sd	mostly my one sister uses hers for her children. You know, children's games.
qr	In the way that it's applied or it's applied at all?
qw	how do you feel that it should be applied?
qy	And that, the penalty ought to be out there, and be enforced?
b	Yeah.
aa	I agree with that completely.
sv	Because if they turn around, they get away with it,
sv	and they get a slap on the wrist.
sv	and they final get up to where they kill somebody else,
sv	Well, they certainly are living off our ex , at our expense.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bf	and be paroled, and and have served the sentence,
sd	that's what people face with that choice.
sv	that should be life,
sd	if they're even in that long.
b	Yeah.
sv	There's should be, you know, for this crime, this is the penalty.
sd	This is what's going to happen.
sv	And, I mean, it sounds horrible.
sd	because they let them back out again,
sd	then they put them back in jail,
sv	and these guys just are on the endless merry go round in the legal system.
sv	And it's like I said at our expense.
b	Yes.
aa	I know,
sd	and they just get away with it,
b	Yeah.
sd	and people like Charles Manson, and some of these other people, who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty, were sentenced to life in prison, and are now that even though California has reinstated the death penalty, for whatever various crimes.
sd	it's been denied fortunately
ny	Yeah.
sd	and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal, the state of California revoked the law in the early seventies,
sv	It seems like a lot of times the law is totally on the criminal side, and isn't protecting the rest of the people.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and then he gets up for this one trial,
sd	I don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever,
aa	Yeah,
b	yeah. Well,
sd	They plead insanity
sd	and then three years later they're cured, and let loose on society again.
sv	I mean, it's a it's a scary world out there anymore, where your afraid to go out,
sd	and I certainly, I, I grew up in a smaller town in Texas,
sd	We could go around,
b	Yes.
sd	and now I don't let my kids out of the front yard, that I can't see them.
b	Uh huh.
fc	Well, good talking to you too.
fc	bye.
ba	no.
ny	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
sd	You sound like my husband.
sd	He likes TOM AND JERRY and, BUGS BUNNY AND ALL HIS FRIENDS. And all those guys.
b	Yeah.
b@	Yeah. * slash error Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd*	Well, I find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for children. Because, * two utts with two kids
sd	and, you know, I don't want them watching something that I don't think they should watch
sd	And I watched that for like, ten or fifteen straight years,
sd	like at work, we'd have a T V or whatever.
b	Yeah.
sd	I had watched it since it started.
sd	now I don't know who the characters are,
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah,
sd	It was not too long ago.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	My younger one doesn't.
sd	She's more into the animated stuff, where my other daughter liked puppets and that kind of thing
ba	Sure.
nn	No,
sd	I've had a few people call me,
ny	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
fc	Thanks.
sd	well, when they were little, we did lots of reading and playing and going to parks, and things of that sort,
sd	They were both interested in things like model rockets,
b	Uh huh.
ba	well, that's good.
sd	they both did T ball and soccer in grade school,
sd	but neither one of them carried on, the sports after that.
ba	wonderful!
b	Yeah,
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
ba	My goodness,
ba	my goodness.
b	Uh huh.
b	really .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	You want to be around for the crisis and things like that,
sv	the one trend I would say is that with so many more women choosing professional careers, there are fewer of them home in the afternoons,
sv	and I don't think it needs to be the mothers,
b	Yes.
aa	I think that's true,
sd	Even when I was there, my boys didn't share all that much with me, and certainly not to the extent I did with my mother.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh
qh	Or what would they do?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	They were fifty miles away
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	and they saw them a lot,
sd	their cousins are about ten years younger.
sd	So, they never played together or anything.
sd	And there are only two of them
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well everyone makes it's own model,
sv	and it's helpful to have, things that become family traditions, and that sort of thing.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah .
sv	well, that's the kind of thing that they will remember, though.
b	Uh huh.
sd	We had a felt one that was li ,
sd	and then you took it off and put it on the tree,
sd	And it finally got moth eaten,
b	I see.
ba	How cute.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	I'm sure he appreciated that!
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	and that is the trend in a lot of, lower class areas, for the grandmothers to be raising the children.
sv	a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
b	Yeah.
nn	No.
ny	Yeah.
na	we did it all except for the sheetrocking.
aa	Yeah,
sd	and whatever you have to put in there to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that.
sd	we didn't know a thing about any of that
sd	I didn't think we could do it and make it look professional.
aa	Probably so
sd	It was brand new.
sd	We started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house
no	well my dad knew how to do most of it, you know.
sd	he'd, we'd gotten a couple of books
sd	it's off the ground.
ny	Uh huh.
nn	no,
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	So, yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is, you know.
sv	It's probably more there.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	gas is a dollar twelve a gallon,
b	Yeah.
ba	You've got something going all the time.
sv	I think that it's time that we concentrate more on what's going on within our own borders than what's going on in the Middle East.
aa	I agree.
aa	Absolutely.
sv	I think that's great.
sv	that doesn't seem to cost a whole lot of money.
sd	But I'm ready to have a President elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda,
aa	I agree.
sv	and I think there's a limit,
b	Yeah.
h	I don't know.
sv	you either do it this way
sv	and it obviously isn't working.
b	yeah.
aa	I agree with you.
ny	Yeah,
na	Right.
sd	unfortunately nineteen ninety.
aa	Yeah,
ng	I do some every now and then,
sd	When I was single we used to always cook, around the house.
ny	yeah,
sd	like, I grew up with you know, having Polish and Ukrainian food.
sd	And my wife, she likes Italian and stuff,
sd	so we definitely have different tastes,
b	Uh huh.
ba	wow.
qy^g	they're like, preferring it now, right .
ny	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sd	We try our hardest to get them to eat what we, eat, you know.
sd	And my sister, she's the master of the fast order grill, you know,
sd	she makes six different meals,
sd	Like to have one thing, you know,
sd	and then she makes noodles with, soy sauce or whatever,
b	But, yeah,
sd	it has a French name,
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	but, it was basically just ground up Swiss cheese and then, standard cream sauce base and then, the scallops.
sv	and it sounds sort of funny
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
sd	she likes to, she doesn't like the beef dishes.
sd	and, like I said, we always ate beef and, pork, you know, a lot,
b	yeah,
sd	My dad could eat, a meal with out any vegetables at all.
sd	And, Susan's, you know, they had, you know meatless meals, you know.
sd	My dad wouldn't know what to do.
sd	Course, she grew up Catholic
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
ar	No,
ny	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sd	after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the Navy, she stopped doing it.
sd	And, the sticky buns, of course, would last, you know three or four days
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
aa	Uh huh,
sd	you just leave it out,
sd	you know, and you let it spoil sort of.
b	You know, yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	But, it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad
b	Yeah
aa	Yeah,
b	Okay,
fc	Where?
fc	Plano,
fc	No,
fc	Yeah,
fc	Yeah,
fc	I think that's why they call me because they want to get people outside the state, you know.
fc	really.
fc^m	Yeah
fc	but I grew up right here in Falls Church, right outside D C.
fc	Yeah,
fc	Yeah,
fc	Yeah,
fc	Well Northern Virginia.
fc	Nice talking to you too.
fc	Bye, bye,
sd	we'd go every weekend.
sd	But we haven't done l , whole lot of it lately.
b	Yeah.
qy	Were you sailboating?
b^m	Yeah.
sd	Well, we don't get to do a whole lot of that up here .
sd	Just motorboat's all we,
sd	Nacogdoches.
sd	That's between Houston and Dallas.
sd	It's the oldest town in Texas.
ny	Yeah.
sd	We have, Lake Sam Rayburn out here and Lake Nacogdoches,
aa	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
sd	Just got through snow skiing .
ny^m	Yeah.
sd^e	Just came back from Denver
b	Yeah,
sd	I didn't see any boats there, though.
bh	Yeah?
sd	all we have up here mostly bass boats.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	lot of fishing going on up here.
qy	you ever heard of Lufkin?
sd	Houston.
^h	Let me see,
sd	Dallas is south.
ng	it's gets cold at night, and then warm in the afternoons.
sd	Probably eighties in the afternoon.
nn	No,
sd	And when I was in high school, we used to go boating every day just about.
sd	And we had a different boat every day.
sd	I'd like to do some sailing.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
qy	Is it pretty easy?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I didn't know that.
ba	That that would be something.
b	Uh huh.
qw	what lake do you all use?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I build transformers.
ny	Yeah.
nn	No,
ny	Yeah.
sd	they have a, you know, worldwide,
sd	all we do here is make transformers electronics and stuff like that.
sd	It's real nice.
sd	Been here all my life.
b	Yeah.
sd	Oklahoma's nothing like it.
ng	I don't have one in my home here.
sd	And my in laws also have one,
sd	They're in Richardson.
sd	usually, word processing something, such as, forms for things,
sd	also I have a nine year old that I've been home schooling for the last three years.
sd	And I have a sister in law who works in the Fort Worth school district.
sd	And so she got me copies of, several of the Apple programs for school programs,
sd	and so we use those
sd	my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things. his resume, his, letter,
sd	he's been applying for jobs and things, that type of thing. forms for his photography business, and that kind of thing.
b	Yeah.
sd	and we're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing, here .
sd	But, they're kind of old older
sd	so I'm not sure that we'll be able to get too many other programs for it.
sd	I have one of those.
b	Yeah,
sd	and so I learned that on there too,
ng	I haven't.
sd	it's the one that's on my father in law's computer.
sd	He's got on I B M.
sd	so that's the program that they're using there.
sd	That's what I've heard.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
ba	that's neat.
ba	how wonderful.
b	Yeah.
ng	Not too much.
ad	Excuse me.
t3	Go on and talk to Daddy about it .
sd	Daddy came home and found her playing with the telephone that I had unplugged .
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and they just talked the other day about setting something up again
sd	My nine year old I've decided to teach her how to type using the computer,
b	Yeah.
 %	I've,
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I wanted her to put it into the computer, and then print it out and, make a book with it, you know.
sd	And so I decided well, if she's going to do that, it would be a whole lot easier if she could type .
sd	So we'll slowly learn just to type here and then then put the story in.
fc	Yeah.
ba	no.
ba	I bet.
aa	I guess so.
b	Uh huh.
qw	What kind of a dog is he?
b	Yeah.
bk	Oh,
b	Yeah.
sd	well, I hope he comes back,
qw	How long have you had him?
ba	that's tough.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah.
sv	And, it's kind of pleasant.
aa	Yeah,
ny	Yes,
sd	Pretty good.
aa	That's right.
ba	That's right.
sv	They just love you, unconditionally.
sv	It's wonderful.
aa	I know it has to be.
b	Uh huh,
b	Oh.
ba	that's really too bad,
sd	Well, I'll, I hope you'll find him.
qy	Well, have you put any posters up or anything like that?
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh,
aa	No,
ba	dear.
ba	Well, that's good.
^2	They can keep their eyes open,
sv	That will help.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	You know, I know sometimes our cat will stay out all night,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	cats are really almost more territorial than dogs are.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, they're really a lot different than dogs because they're very independent,
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
aa	They sure do.
b	Yeah.
qy	Now, do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go outs ,
qy	You have a fenced yard or,
b^m	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	boy.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
bk	Oh.
b	Yeah,
sv	Well, you know, that, animals are like that.
aa	No.
aa	No.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah,
qw	What's his name,
qy^m	Buddy?
sd	that's was our cat's name that, that died.
ny	yeah.
sd	we were really into that when we got him going to the Ranger games,
sd	But, he was a good cat, too.
sd	and I feel real guilty because we had him, like, for six years
sd	And I just felt so bad,
sd	and if they don't have their booster, any kind of saliva or anything from another cat, if they get in a fight it automatically, like,
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
qw	what's your most recent one that you've seen?
b	Uh huh.
b	Really,
nn	No,
nn	No,
nn	no,
sd	action .
sd	And those are like two of my most favorite,
ny	yeah,
bk	Okay,
b	Really,
^h	gosh, I can't think off my head.
b	yeah,
b	Right.
b	Really.
sd	See, I've never seen that.
nn	No,
qy	Should I go rent it tomorrow .
sd	That's probably something I need to see right now because I'm taking history in school .
sd@	So it'd probably be a good thing for me to see. Oh.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really.
sv	you just gave it away,
ba	That does sound good,
bk	Okay,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	it's not David is it?
sd	I don't watch that .
b	Really.
sd	see, that's, that's one side of the action I guess that I didn't really care for
sv	I don't think he's really a very good actor.
ba	Hey that's pretty good.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sv	and so many of them are done so poorly,
sv	you know it just doesn't even give you the effect,
sd	that was one of my favorites,
sd	I was really impressed with that one.
sv	You know, and it was done so well, you know,
aa	Right,
sd	it's not my all time favorite movie
qy^d	And, I don't know if you like this kind,
b	Yeah,
sv	you know, but it was really good.
nn	No,
qy^d	It must have, what's his name in it.
bk^m	No
b	Really.
ny	Yeah,
nn^m	No,
qy^d	really, that must be pretty good then,
bk	Oh .
ny	Yes,
aa	Yeah,
ad	you've got to see that one,
aa	Right,
sd	I was really glad when it won all those awards because it really deserved it.
bh	Really.
ba	wow, that's impressive.
aa	yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sv	You know, I guess it was okay,
sd	Well, we've, we've test driven the Oldsmobile Delta Eighty eight and a Cutlass Supreme and a used Cadillac, about three or four years old because, I get married in a couple of weeks
sd	and I have two kids
sd	so we need a car that's big enough for six.
sd	And so I guess it was two weekends ago, we went, car shopping and looked around.
sd	We found something interesting at Crest Oldsmobile Cadillac up there on Central Expressway
sd	that, in addition to getting a new car there, they can get you a car that's new
sd	So, they call this program cars,
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	yeah.
aa	Yeah,
na	Well, the ones that we were test driving were the new ones there.
sd	Well now, they may be the demonstrator models that the sales reps drive around in.
ny	Yeah.
sd	The guy said it'd been on the lot about thirty minutes.
sv	Those things go fast.
sd	of course we can't consider getting a brand new Cadillac, because those are twenty five to thirty thousand dollars.
sv	But when they're three years old they're,
sv	So then it becomes, more realistic.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
aa	That's right.
sv	but if you've narrowed it down to one or two you can have the car, checked at, an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong, because they don't have any financial interest in it.
sv	And then you'll have a realistic assessment of what you're getting.
sd	I'm thinking around twenty or twenty five dollars.
aa	No,
aa	I would think so.
qy	Isn't that a good feeling.
aa	That's right.
ad	Well, what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for three or four years
ad	and when you're ready to get another car just pay cash for it.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Sure.
aa	Right,
aa	That's right.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
aa	Eventually.
sd	The first car I kept for thirteen and a half years and got a hundred and sixty one thousand out of it.
sd	The second car I ever bought I drive to work now.
sd	So that's kind of in the way I've done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever.
sd	But, my car is using two quarts of oil a week now.
sd	about a quart every hundred miles.
sd	but, it runs fine,
sd	If I just keep the oil in, it seems to be okay.
sd	It's a Buick Century.
nn	No,
sd	And so she's going to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try to make as much down payment as possible to keep the monthly payment low.
b	Yeah.
sv	You lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in.
bh	really.
ba	there you go.
ba	that's fact.
aa	I think you're right.
ba	Interesting.
b	Okay,
bk	okay.
aa	That's right,
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Is that right.
ba	My gosh.
qy^d	And you laughed all the way to the bank.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
ba	Such a deal.
ba	I'll bet you did.
fc	Well, Dana, it's been really interesting,
fc	Okay
fc	Thank you much.
fc^m	Bye bye.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
sv	and we have such a huge, national deficit,
b	Uh huh.
ar	I'm sorry,
aa	Right,
sd	and I know that the tax there is extremely high, much higher than we pay here,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	you didn't.
b	did you.
sd	I didn't know that.
sd	I didn't realize that .
aa	Exactly.
aa	yes,
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sv	and I don't know that that's really what we're talking about.
aa	Yeah,
sv	you know, it could even be done while they're doing another job, while they're doing, you know, a job to make money.
sv	I think the family would have to be involved in it.
sv	And people would have to be convinced that, you know,
sv	And that's not the kind of society we have right now.
sv	There's lots and lots of volunteer programs
sv	younger people feel like it's not open to them,
b	Yeah,
sd	But some high schools have actually started like a visitation program to, you know, areas economically, say less advantaged areas.
sd	And, they promote service on the part of the kids to, some of those people.
sv	it's really unfortunate because when you do,
sv	it's really a gift to yourself
sv	and maybe that's why we have so many people in society who are not really happy, you know.
sv	Because if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on yourself, you're just kind of down the tube, you know .
sv	it really is better to give then to receive.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I, I was just, in high school I guess when it ended.
sd	I was in the last lottery.
sd	And I was glad it was over by then.
sd	I've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there.
sd	I work with several that were over there,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war. I mean they seemed like a valiant thing.
sd	you knew who was good.
sd	And it was a the traditional battle of, kind of good versus evil, you know whichever way it is.
sd	and the Cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah. .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	You were?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qw	What, grade is your daughter in?
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh,
aa	no,

b	Uh huh.
aa	Uh huh,
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I do too,
qh	But, then, what do I know,
ng	I don't have any kids.
ny	yeah .
fc	Well, it was good talking to you too.
fc	We'll see you,
sd	I think I would like something like a, an economy car that gets really good mileage and, one that's really reliable.
na	absolutely,
na	I would think kind of a subdued color would be nice.
ny	Yeah,
sd	I think that's something we might want, too, is some kind of standard transmission at least rather than automatic.
sd	I think we would want one that, even though it was a compact car or whatever that it would still be nice enough that, you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed .
na	well probably, probably that would be a good idea,
aa	That's right.
ny	Yes,
fc	Well, thank you for calling.
fc	All right.
fc	Bye.
b	Uh huh.
ng	I haven't had to.
sd	most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway, I get pretty good stuff.
sv	I think that, aside from the fact all markets being internationalized
sv	and if you want to buy American , it takes real extra work to find.
sv	It's probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the U S .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	I know.
ba	Wow.
sd	Well, they got a three year lead time.
sv	The computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer.
qh	And can you think of any other industry where in software they,
sv(^q)	Or, maybe I say, well, you know, you paid five hundred bucks for this program, so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade.
b	Yeah.
sv	And well, I mean, all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity
aa	Really,
sv	They'd sell more if they were honest.
sv	Yeah, it it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure D O S. base.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
sd	But, technically, I'm not actually in the industry.
sd	I'm an abuser.
sv	But it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to you know, keep up with the changes as they happen.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	we got what some people call the best beef in the world.
sd	So it's, Bishu ,
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, they have an Argentinean place down in Georgetown.
br	Excuse me?
nn	no,
sd(^q)	and like somebody says okay, when are we having this, you know,
sd	You know, like you have to prepare the fire, and then put the sausages on,
nn	No,
sd	And so they got the meat place.
sd	And so you just go there
sd	Well, basically, it's, what we call it impenadas which is, like,
aa	Right,
sd	And, then we also put sausages on a bun,
sd	And then what you have is also you know, like three different kinds of salad.
sd	And that's about it.
nn	no.
bk	okay.
b	Yeah.
ar	No,
b	Yeah.
qy	Are you?
sd	And being Argentinean we also have a lot of pasta.
b	Yeah,
b	okay.
b	Yeah,
b	Okay.
b	Okay.
b	Right.
b@	Right . * slash error Yeah. / * slash error should be 'b'
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
b	Okay.
qy	Is it?
sd	it's like, when you go buy fish, you know
sd	well like I buy like the fish
sd	I've seen, you know, the filet.
qw	What kind of fish?
b	Okay.
sd	So we put soy sauce and sesame.
b	Okay.
b	Okay.
b	Okay,
b	Yeah.
nn	No,
ad	Wait, wait, wait, H, / * three?
b^m	H O I,
b^m	S I N,
b	Okay.
qw	how much pork do you buy for two people.
b	Right.
sd	So, it's just, since I'm from Argentina, I just love meat.
b	Okay.
b	Okay.
qw	And how much does it cost?
ny	Yeah.
b	okay.
b	Yeah.
b	okay.
fc	Same here.
fc	All right.
fc	Bye bye.
b	Yeah,
bk	Okay,
bk	Okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	And, you know, I'd been in a parochial school before junior high
sd	So, you know, I like the concept they've got now where they have more directed education, you know,
sd	Well, they talk about it
aa	Right.
b	Right,
b	Right.
aa	Right.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
no	I don't know about that,
sd	and I'm wondering if that's going to have any effect, you know, on what you see now.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sv	You hope.
sv	I guess you just have to wonder,
qr	what do you advocate, more taxes or better management of what they got?
b	Yeah .
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	You, have to learn,
sd	the only reason I asked about secondary schools or, you know, advanced education is because down here, you know, going to the University of Texas, the education I'm getting I think is kind of shoddy for a public school.
sd	I don't think I'm getting what I should,
h	I don't know,
sd	Well, lately I've seen SOAP DISH.
sd	and that was a lot of fun.
b	Yeah,
sd	I saw THELMA AND LOUISE. A couple of days ago, and really liked that.
sd	Actually I saw it twice because I liked it so much.
sd	And it's really disturbing but a good movie.
^h	let's see.
sd	But it's with women in it instead of men
sd	And it made me think a lot about, you know,
sd	So, that was kind of interesting.
aa	Yeah,
sd	They had started out with that,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	It's TRUTH OR DARE
ny	Yeah,
sd	And so it was interesting .
b	Righ ,
aa	Right.
sv	I thought that was pushing it a little bit
aa	She is.
sv	she's smart at what she does.
ny	Yeah.
bh	Really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	I know,
b	Right .
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sv	you know, you didn't, hear any press about that.
sv	I thought it was a very interesting movie.
b	Right.
aa	Uh huh .
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I know the ,
ba	Well, that's good.
ba	that was, it was, it was good.
sd	But it put me in a really bad mood,
ny	Yeah,
sd	we were grouchy.
aa	I know
sd	We were not responsible,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Righ ,
sd	don't have a job
sd	I rented a good movie, called CINEMA PARADESO which is an Italian movie which is probably the best movie I've seen ever.
sd	It was just, wonderful.
sd	It's, uh, story about a little boy in a little Italian village,
sd	I mean, if you don't mind reading subtitles,
sd	That was a great one.
nn^e	No, I had , I hadn't.
qy	Did you like it?
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
nd	Well I have wallpaper in both of my bathrooms right now which is really pretty disgusting.
sd	And, it's a rent house
sd	And I've been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Ugh.
b	Yeah.
sd	so I want something that's going to tie that together
bf	So it's going to have kind of a country look.
sd	and I haven't even decided as far as, what kind of paint to buy.
aa	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh,
bk	Okay,
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	I'm wondering if my bigger problem is getting the wallpaper taken down first. Because I think,
nn	No,
aa	Okay.
sv	Well that's something that's worthwhile checking into then. 'Cause I,
sd	it's hard to tell,
sd	And I know the house, was built around the mid fifties.
sd	So it may be the original wallpaper .
sd	in one bathroom it's probably paper,
ba	that's kind of an odd color for a bathroom.
b	Really.
sd	and I'm not really quite sure,
aa	Yeah,
sd	It wouldn't be any kind of special effects type thing.
sd	It would be just plain paint.
aa	okay.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it peels the paint off when you take it off,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	really,
aa	Okay.
ad	if you were closer I'd, I'd tell you you could come over and supervise .
sv	Well, we'll see how it goes,
b	Yeah.
fc	Yeah,
fc	It's was nice talking to you Kathleen.
fc^m	Bye bye.
nn	no
sd	I grew up most of my childhood in Germany.
sd	we took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance.
sd	So we travelled all over Europe. when I was very young. Unfortunately, a little bit too young to really appreciate.
sd	I was grade school age.
sd	That, that would be to me, a really nice vacation because I'm not in physical shape for something like that, but, I sure would work on it , if I had an opportunity like that.
sd	well my husband and I are scuba divers.
sd	So, we both like to go to dive resorts.
sd	and we dove there.
sd	but, we weren't able to get enough people together for the trip.
sd	and we couldn't get enough people together, to go,
sd	We were going to get a really good price.
b	Uh huh.
^2	Snorkeling?
sd	Well, my husband and I both like water,
sd	so any vacation that we go on is usually, close to the ocean, or something like that.
b	Yeah,
sd	And I lived there for seven years.
sd	 and I really enjoyed that because, you know, the mountains were real close,
sd	we like the white mountains
sd	I went skiing once.
b	Uh huh.
ng	not really so much.
sd	but we never have really planned a vacation around, places to go hiking.
ny	Yeah.
nn	No,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b@	 Uh huh.
ba	that sounds like a lot of fun.
sd	that there were several hundred, people
b	Uh huh.
sd	or something like the Volkswagen Vanagon. I've heard is really nice.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	he's retired
sd	he's in his sixties,
sd	just see, see the rest of the country.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but he's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	and then eventually, when we have kids,
sd	Now, his folks did a lot of traveling across country.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	As long as I have a shower nearby, I'm fine . And electricity.
b	Yeah.
fc	It was nice talking to you, too, Beth.
fc^m	Okay.
sv	of course I'm sure we're familiar with the exact same benefit package
qy	isn't it great?
b	Uh huh
b	Yeah.
ba	I had never really thought of it that way
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It's not going to build up, quite enough,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
bh	Do you?
bh	Do you really not?
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
ba	goodness.
b	Yeah.
ba	Exactly.
aa	That's right,
b	Yeah.
bh	Think so?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	true.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Which is the same,
b	Uh huh.
aa	No .
sd	I'm from Plano also.
aa	That's right.
b	Right.
sd	I just got back from Dayton.
sd	and the trees are changing color there.
sd	as soon as we got out of the cloud cover.
sd	but as soon as the plane got through the clouds
sd	I don't complain weather wise though, because it was also thirty five degrees there yesterday morning,
sd	so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
sd	We did that when we lived up in Michigan.
aa	Yes.
aa	I think it is,
sv	Just so we don't have one of those famous ice storms in the spring.
nd	Well, I've only been here just a short time, too,
sd	So, as I understand it here, if there's anything, they'll call off schools and close businesses.
b	Right.
aa	Right,
fc	I think so.
fc	It was nice talking with you.
fc	Okay.
fc	Okay.
fc	Bye.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sv	And they seemed to have the best coverage.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, I know that the coverage he was allowed to present was slanted,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	Northern.
sd	Palo Alto.
sv	it's horrible.
sv	The San Francisco paper is just wretched.
^h	Palo Alto is about midway between.
ny	Yeah,
sd	but they're, both run by the same peo ,
sv	They're just horrid
na	we can,
sd	So we subscribe to the NEW YORK TIMES and the WALL STREET JOURNAL and MERCURY NEWS.
b	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes
sv	We almost have too much.
sd	Well, I cannot stand Dan Rather.
sd	And I hated him then.
sd	And I would not watch that man for money.
sd	And he and Barbara Walters just really turn my stomach.
sd	So I watch Peter Jennings, and, and Tom Brokaw. Sort of alternately.
qy	Do we get enough news or something like that?
qy	Do we get, do we get the news that we want?
sv	And I do.
b	Yeah.
fc	Okay,
fc^m	Bye bye.
b^m	Okay,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	when my children were growing up, up and until they were in the preschool situation, I had them in a home with a lady who kept two or three kids,
sd	It was important to me
sv	and, I feel like that they had that one on one that's so necessary at that age.
sv	However in today's environment it may be more critical to have the ability to interact in large groups, simply because that's the way our young people are dealt with.
sv	They're dealt with, in packages.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Absolutely,
aa	absolutely
b	Uh huh.
sv	however, when it came to hiring and staffing people who cared and who were willing to take care of those children and spend that kind of time, the pay is minimal
sv	and it takes people with total and complete dedication who really don't want to make a living for themselves in order to be in that environment,
aa	Absolutely,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	They are to be there ahead of time, you know,
aa	That's right.
sd	And, she just had a terrible time keeping sincerely dedicated people simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I know that when my youngsters were small,
sd	and, my younger son went into child care at six weeks.
sd	So, they were in that environment actually, up until they became, seven and nine.
sd(^q)	And at that point I said, Look they have been given the custodial care that they need,
sd	So I quit working after my kids started to school and got involved in volunteer work in their private school so that I could help direct their learning experiences and their development.
sd	I felt like that anybody who cared and loved the kids could change their diapers and feed them and bathe them and hold them.
sd	But when time came to direct their ability to make choices to develop the kinds of things that they're going to need to interact with other people, I felt like I needed some strong influence there.
aa	I know.
sd	and I was just really grateful I only had one bad child care experience.
sd	and she was going back home,
sd	so I had to find a new place
sd	and I put them in this home,
sd	they were always cranky and irritable
sd	so I just took off and went there one day,
sd	and, so it didn't take me long to take them out of that place
sd	but, that's the only bad experience I had,
sd	and I was very pleased with their development and their progress.
sd	They learned a lot of things in those public environments that you just as soon they didn't learn,
sd	and it did appear to me that the people who cared for them had a good concern for them,
sd	however, my older son came home
ba	boy,
sd(^q)	and Well, she said, you know, kids do exaggerate,
nd	Well, Rome is pretty small .
sd	we hear a lot about, New York City.
sd	There is a lot of crime down there.
nn	No,
nn	No.
sd	So, there is a base up here.
sd	Bases are pretty safe because they check your I D on your way in.
aa	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	That makes it bad for getting out during a fire.
h	I do not, I do not know,
sd	But I went home,
sd	and this thing came on where a group of like five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and robbing them.
sd	And it was really disgusting.
b	Yeah.
sd	They were young men.
aa	I know it.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qh	I wonder where,
h	I do not know.
aa	Yeah.
aa	definitely.
aa	I think so definitely.
aa	Yep.
ny	yeah.
na	I am in the Air Force.
sd	And so, people outside the Air Force doing engineering get paid a lot more than we do.
sd(^q)	And so all the young engineers are like, well, I am just, going, you know,
^q	get it for all it is worth.
sd(^q)	and I am like, you are the one who signed up.
aa	Yep,
sd	I like it so far.
^h	Oh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I would hate to be there during Mardi Gras.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I know .
sv	You can't trust anybody.
sv	it is really scary.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, you, hear about people opening the door and getting blown away.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
sv	But, you know, you just hear about that, you know,
sv	it is a lot of repeat crime.
sd	that it is more, like in Boston,
sd	So they picked on this kid who was like new in town.
sd(^q)	And they were like, well, no one was going to miss him anyway, you know,
ba	that is horrible.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
qy^d	for the sneakers.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Right.
sv	And, I think that that is, you know, very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sd	You know, I go to a, I have a club that I belong to on Tuesday that,
sv	So that's a, I think that's a change
b	Right.
aa	No.
sv	It's been changing,
sv(^q)	And you hear some people say, you know,
b	Right.
^2	And going,
aa	Right.
sv	The man is looking in the engine
sv	And if they're out there buying that many cars, then there's that many out that are self sufficient and, you know, mobile and working.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I just happen to be off today.
sd	I work, too.
sd	I'm a nurse.
sd	And I work at Medical Treatment Center, which is at Jupiter and Arapaho.
nn	No.
h	I don't know,
qy^m	You've come a long way baby?
b	Right.
ng	I can't really say recently.
sd	but I found that, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting after,
sd	even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it got rusty after about, three weeks of use.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
sd	up here in the northeast, well w , we have these mail order companies like L L Bean
sd	I mean I've, I, I have friends and family who order from them because you can I've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year, wear it for a year and a half,
sd	I guess if you call any eight hundred number, if, you can call up any eight hundred number directory assistance, you can get, the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies.
sd	like the customer is always right
sv	Well I guess nowadays with the economy the way it is, I guess,
sd	Well, I don't really like that very much.
qw	What was the reason why somebody was trying to find out all that stuff?
bk	Oh.
b	yeah.
ba	Well, that's not really good.
sv	Something that I feel is a, pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that's really so common that it's accepted as the norm now, is the open office concept.
ny	Uh huh,
sd	and people have little cubicles.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	and it's not just that,
sd	And I work in a situation like that
ny	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, they take my name, which is a very common name,
sd	and they check that name against, their list
no	they don't even check my Social Security number.
sd	then, you know, to get it removed they say, well, you know, you have to write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them, you know,
^q	You messed it up,
nn	No,
sd	like, recently I was reported as having J C Penney accounts
sd(^q)	So then they can call the credit bureau and say, hey, you know, we're paying you good money to report this properly
sd	So that's what I've taken to doing lately,
ng	Not that I can think of.
fc	yeah,
fc	Okay.
fc	All rightie.
fc^m	Bye bye.
sd	Well I can profit by this because I'm due with my first in about three months.
aa	I guess not,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes.
sd	Well, the thing I really worry about is, the sexual abuse cases you read about.
sv	And I mean you'd just feel awful if something like that happened.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know so many of my friends I went to school with who are having babies right now
sd	Well I'm just thanking heaven.
sd	and he just got a new job.
aa	I suppose.
b	Uh huh.
^2	You have to start wondering if they don't want you.
na	I have one
b	Uh huh.
aa	This is true.
sv	CURRENT AFFAIR can , get several shows child cases.
sd	well, my feelings on it is, I wouldn't take a child to day care . You know?
sd	just a baby sitter in a home.
sv	Well, too many kids and I think too many infections and things coming in.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
b	uh huh.
aa	yeah,
bk	Oh.
bh	she did?
^2	Wrapping her arm all the way around.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
qrr^d	Or just never said anything.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	Well, I think it's hard to leave them,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	yeah.
aa	yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sv	That's for sure.
aa	Uh huh,
qw	Where do you live?
ba^m	San Antonio!
sd	Well, I live in Garland
sd	but, as far as, trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing, they're testing that.
sd	So, they're really not full force into it,
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
aa	Right,
aa	Right,
aa	Yeah,
sd	And I really like that because that makes it real convenient because they're in almost every shopping center,
sd	and I started doing that at work.
sd	and that's really helped a lot,
sd	So, I really like that,
sd	At work we started, all the recycling stuff.
sd	And, that really, started a lot of stuff off,
ba	That's good.
ba	at least your trying something.
sv	it would be nice if it could be more.
bh	do you really.
ba	Well that's a neat idea.
b	Right.
ba	Well that's really good,
b	Yeah
sd(^q)	and I thought, I don't understand this, you know.
^q	We're trying to cut cost and everything like that, and recycle and all that stuff
b	Uh huh.
sd	That's exactly what I did.
sd	Exactly what I did, exactly.
sd	Because I didn't want to waste that.
sv	And it's hard enough to find good packing boxes .
aa	Right.
aa	Exactly right,
aa	Right,
sd	I found about nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes, that were in the dumpsters.
fe	gosh,
aa	Right,
b	Uh huh,
sd	That's exactly what I do.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^2	And they look just as good.
sd	I think I'll have to try that.
sv	They're the exact same thing.
sd	You saved me some money.
ba	Well that's neat.
sd	But ours are real hard to find.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well that's good.
sd	like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk.
sd	but in the paper one you have to separate.
sd	You can't throw any of that away
sd	But I do get tired of having to separate paper, you know.
aa	Right,
sd	And somebody was writing in complaining that the people had, dumped all the trash in the same bin.
sd	And when they were questioned about it they said well, we're running late,
aa	Right,
sd	But luckily that will all get straightened out
fc	You too.
fc	Bye.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	I go for that,
sd	In fact, I'm a little worried about this one coming up here.
sd	I think there's an eighty percent chance this evening,
sd	But I think the highs are going to be in the sixties, and the lows in the forties.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I like it when it's sort of a medium temperature, maybe seventy five to eighty, somewhere in there.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yes,
sd	they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather. You know
sd	it wasn't just a super bad storm,
ba	wow.
aa	Yeah,
ba	Wow.
sd	I just don't move very well when it's that cold.
aa	Yeah, well.
sv	not a real in depth topic, but enjoyed talking to you.
fc	Okay.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	Well, the, the major cause it seems up here is exc ,
sd	but the major cause here, and we always seem to, and it seems to be validated by the press, is the car pollution.
sd	car pollution seems to be the one and only thing that I can really put my finger on here.
bh	Is that so?
sd	I didn't know that.
sv	Well, most people talk about the noise pollution from airplanes rather than the air pollution.
b	Yeah.
b	No,
aa	Yeah,
ny	yeah,
sv	and I guess refrigerators, are the same way.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	And no lead gas came to the pumps.
sv	And I think that th , there are solutions,
aa	That's right.
ny	yeah, well,
sv	So, I guess you're better off sitting behind a bus than a car although I could never, really a , rationalize that while I was sitting there .
b	Yeah.
sd	right close to where I live is the Seabrook Nucleus site which is, practically a, you know, guerilla war up here, went on for years.
sd	my daughters marched against the Seabrook
b	Yeah.
sv	So we really don't know whether there's enough fossil fuel left
aa	No.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yes.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, since Texas and Louisiana and, California in that ranking order, the worst pollutants in America.
sd	I mean, I read that the other day.
sv	And California seems to be taking steps,
sv	But, again, that didn't occur without a crisis.
aa	Yeah,
sv	that was its most personal, personal, pollution that I can think of.
fc	something happen.
fc	Bye bye.
bh	You do?
sv	I think they get a lot of people in trouble.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I got in trouble when I was in the service quite a few years ago like ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble.
sd	you know, so I eventually got it all paid.
b	Yeah.
sd	But I know a lot of people that get in trouble with them especially, you know
b	Yeah.
ba	Gee.
aa	Yes,
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, my wife got in trouble one time with hers.
sd	So and that was before we got married,
sd	That's the first thing he wanted.
ny	Yeah.
sd^e	So we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick.
sv	But I think they're too readily accessible
sv	and there's too many companies out there that are willing to give them to you and get you trapped.
sd	And you know, we had all the necessities,
b	Yeah.
sv	I think if cards were as stringent as say a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to, you know, be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills, we probably wouldn't have the problems we have.
sv	Of course, we wouldn't have the retail market we have either
sd	I disagree with it,
bh	Are you?
b	All right.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sd	we have a eighteen year old, seventeen year old, and a seven year old.
ny	Yeah.
bh	are you?
qy	you're a Mormon then?
bk	all right .
qw	What's that?
b	yeah.
na^t	fifteen or twenty I guess.
ny	yeah.
na^t	I try to every day.
b	Okay.
sd	But, I'm a divorced woman.
sd	and, you know, when we dine out we go to like medium priced restaurants.
sv	I think it's sort of a waste of money to go to a real high priced restaurant.
ng	n , Not really.
b	Yeah.
sd	well, I like Chinese food.
sd	there's a little place down on, what is that? Coit Road, Chinese Pavilion or something. That is really good
sd	and I like it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
qy	have you ever, tried Pappasito's?
sd	it is delicious.
b	Uh huh.
sd	you always stand in line when you go
b	Uh huh.
aa	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qy^d	th , they're the Spaghetti Warehouse type.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sd	It's real entertaining for her.
ng	not really.
qy	Steak.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
aa	Right.
sv	Of course, you know, down, next to downtown up around McKinney and everything you know, there's a different class of restaurants up there that I can't even touch.
sv	You know, it would probably take my whole paycheck just to go in and have one meal up there
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	besides, you know, chicken and steaks and everything I grill at home.
sd	and really they're a lot better than what I get in the restaurant .
aa	That's right.
^h	favorite place,
aa	Yeah,
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
nn	No,
fc	Uh huh,
fc^m	Bye bye.
sd	Well, I'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes.
sv	Well, I think first degree murder, probably warrants it.
aa	Right.
aa	Exactly.
sd	well I originally come from the state that has, the death penalty.
sd	And, they're pretty liberal on it.
ad	go ahead.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
h	I don't know.
sv	And that's not,
sv	I think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it
sd	with Florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and you know, it's, it gets to be a big problem.
ad	go ahead.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
na	sure, you know.
sd	I mean just because, like we said before, they don't have enough room in the jails you know, there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early.
h	I don't know,
sv	Maybe not solve it,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bk	okay.
bk	Okay.
sd	I'm a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida.
ny	Yeah,
ny	yeah.
h	But, I don't know.
b	Uh huh.
bh	is that right?
bk	Okay.
ba	Jeez,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, really, the only things that I have returned have not been faulty,
sd	I really haven't had to return things because they didn't perform the way they were supposed to.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
sd	But we did have Barbies and things,
sd	So she wasn't in it for very long before she was out of it,
nn	No,
ba	Goodness.
ba	dear.
sv	Well, I guess if they'll replace them, then they assume they shouldn't have broken.
^2	Any direction.
b	Uh huh.
sd	You know, that was about it.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And the main thing my kids seem to be into nowadays are electronics.
ny	Uh huh
nn	No,
sv	And, it seems like it's just an added tack on.
sv	so it seems like it's a waste of money.
aa	Uh huh.
sv	And so it seems ridiculous.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I do too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd(^q)	and he said we're not going to buy any of these anymore,
aa	Uh huh,
nd	Well, you look at the consumer guide.
sd	And, you go around
sd	that's the first I've ever heard of it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b@	Uh huh. Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b^m	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And I was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me.
sd	But I don't know if I was doing it in different situation, you know, not a really religious background, if I would get a lot out of it.
b	Right.
sd	well, like I say, I know that there are some type of programs that they have available for like teenagers to go and do, work in the national parks and work in, neighborhoods to clean up and that sort of thing.
sv	But I know that that helps a lot with training and, a lot of,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
aa	Right,
sv	yeah, so that may not benefit them in the long run.
fc	Okay,
fc	You, too,
sv	Well, I think they're kind of ambivalent, really.
sv	we don't know, half the time we don't know who to support.
sv	It's got to be tough,
aa	Yeah,
sv	and , you know, of course I'm sure we have some enemies down there who wouldn't care what happened to us,
sv	but but that's a tough deal,
sv	maybe it's, you know, I'm reflecting how I feel about it,
sv	and it's still going on,
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
na	I can see his face forget his name .
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sv	And it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing,
sv	Well, I think it's long overdue
sv	there's so much difference in the economies of the two countries, you know, I have a problem, with whether it's going to work or not, you know,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
b	yeah.
sv	I think their version of the good old boy network going that,
sd	mostly what I do,
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I get too involved in reading sometimes that I neglect what I should be doing.
sv	You get so involved in what you're reading.
sd	I do a little bit of woodworking,
sd	and my dad had a lot of woodworking equipment
sd	and I did some of that.
sd	Mostly just stuff that I can, you know, use right around the house or give away as gifts.
sd	I've been making a lot of quilts, well, not a lot, but several quilts lately.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
sd	It never has worked out completely.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	it was just too much to start with.
sd	And there were so many different shadings and colors,
sd	And I've done some of the crewel and something similar to that
sd	but it doesn't have the specific stitches.
sd	More like embroidery or something.
b	Yeah.
qo	How about movies,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	It's so nice though when you have a nice yard full of flowers,
sd	I've got a few plants here,
sd	So I enjoy it,
b	yeah.
qy	Have you tried growing any, like fruits and vegetables or anything?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I considered it last year
sv	So. I think it would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch.
sd	if I'd do something, be motivated enough to do something, I think it would work out well.
sd	but there goes that motivation thing again .
ba	that's good,
b	yeah.
qy^g	Sulked for a while, .
sd	Well, I like animals,
sd	and we thought, well maybe when they're a little bit bigger then we'll,
sd	or get into a house with a little more space.
sd	But I like dogs
b	Uh huh.
aa	I agree with you.
sd	that she can watch, but won't take too much care.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Especially when they're not quite to the age of understanding that they're hurting, you know,
sd	And if I was a cat or dog, I'd respond probably by biting or something.
sd	That'd be my self defense.
fc	okay.
fc	Thank you for calling.
fc^m	Bye bye.
ny	Well, yes,
qy	Do you?
b	Is that right.
bf	You were a bookkeeper .
ba	no.
sd	Well, I have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back,
sd	but I'm really having questions if I can deal with that system and have a good conscience about, you know, what I do.
b	Right.
sv	What child's going to say something some parent's going to overreact to
aa	that's true.
na	I have two,
sd	We, live in a district that has open classrooms,
ny	Yes.
b	You too.
b	Oh.
b	Still at it.
ba	goodness.
b	Oh.
bh	Were they?
sd	Well, we were from North, Carolina,
sd	but our children got a very good education there
sd	they were in the magnet school program,
sd	and it was wonderful
sd(^q)	so, you know, I'm coming to Plano thinking, Well, gosh, it's going to be really great,
ba	Isn't that interesting,
aa	I guess so.
ny	Yeah.
sd	And, he's pleased with his classes.
ba	Well, that's good.
sd	Well, Eric seems to have quite a few nights where he doesn't have any,
aa	That's right.
sd	most of it is from the radio, and also from the news programs that we watch in the afternoon.
sd	We usually watch the local news and the, national news both.
sv	Well you can always get up and leave that .
sd	I just don't seem to have time to sit down and read the paper.
sv	So, it's so much easier to sit there
b	Yeah.
sv	I think they did a great job.
b	Uh huh .
sv	And you could always find some channel that had something on
b^m	Yeah,
sd	and they used to have a program called T News, and just updates of different things that were going on within T I.
sd	Well now, they have had so much good response from this, that T I now has C N N on all the time.
sd	So, we can always run upstairs and, you know, get a quickie update on what's going on, if we really want to.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yes .
sd	and we just don't have it available out there where we are.
sd	and sometimes we'd watch the weather stations.
b	Yeah.
sd	I get that too, because I'm in a van pool,
sd	and I'm in the van, you know, two hours a day
ny	Yes,
sd	And in the morning I try to sleep because it's dark thirty.
b	Yeah.
qy	are you in Baltimore itself?
b	Yeah,
nn	well no,
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	no,
sv	Well most of what they're talking about in Washington is the crime problems that they're having there.
b	Uh huh,
aa	Yeah,
sd	they both moved way out.
sd	I think one of them lives in Germantown
aa	Uh huh,
sd	It's, means they have to drive a little bit,
sd	well now, I think he carpools,
sd	Because he's got fairly regular hours since he came back,
sd	And then she was supposed to have gotten out of active duty as of last Friday.
nd	We were gone .
nn	no,
fc	Well I thank you for calling,
fc	Thank you,
sv	Well, our public schools are really poor, I feel.
sd	I'm not sure where Georgia ranks in the nation
sv	And, there's a lot of things that I see that are so obviously wrong. That you would think it would be easy to correct.
sv	But the system doesn't allow for the corrections .
qo	How about you?
bk	yes.
b	Yes.
sd	She was in Cobb County.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
ba	Well, that's great.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I feel that we're way behind.
aa	Yeah .
sd	my husband and I go to the store
sd	And, I don't blame the teachers as much as I blame the system.
sv	well, for one thing there's not enough money in the school system.
sd	my son's teacher has twenty seven students.
sv	And that's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal with on an every day basis.
sv	but more than that, I don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children.
sv	And when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps the class in an uproar and you're not at liberty to do something about it, other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office. It it, you know, it can, it can really be bad.
sv	also I think, we have a lot of, Hispanics
sd	the county I'm in, the minorities are mostly Hispanic.
ar	No .
ny	yes,
sd	I hate to say,
sv	But it is a problem . especially in the inner city.
nd	Well,
sv	and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done you know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
sd	We just cannot afford it.
sv	Have a big family, I guess,
sd	Twenty five,
sd	I just got married.
nd	Well, we plan on it,
sd	so it's every four years
aa	Yeah
sd	And, a lot of my family is in Indiana.
sd	So, we usually meet like at my uncle's cottage at the lake and, make a couple days of it.
ny	Yeah,
ny	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
nn	no,
na	the ones in Indiana,
sd	Lafayette.
b	Yeah,
aa	Uh huh,
sd	Well it's like, the last one was my high school graduation
no	maybe,
sd	two more years,
aa	Yeah,
b	yeah,
sd	so they all met,
ny	Yeah.
nn	No,
bh	really.
qy	Are they getting all the data they need?
bh	really.
fc	Well we've kind of exhausted everything I guess.
fc	okay.
fc	yeah.
fc	Well you too.
fc	And maybe I'll talk to you again.
fc	Okay,
sd	I generally go to the quickie places just because they're cheap.
na	we have four,
ny	Yes.
sd	I'm in Texas.
sd	And we lived in Ohio prior to this.
b	Yeah,
sv	I don't like to go to the drive thrus because sometimes they get your order wrong
sv	and then you're stuck
sd	so I really don't like the drive thrus that much.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	and, in, in the countries, unless it's a large city, I guess Dairy Queen and Wal Mart are their main .
sv	That's what you find,
sd	My husband likes, Dairy Queens.
sd	so he's a fan of Dairy Queen,
sd	But we eat out so much it's gotten so I don't like to really eat any place
sd	so that might be why I look for inexpensive places just because we're eating out probably five nights a week maybe.
sd	Or we eat junk food at home
sd	we'll go to them all.
sd	so mine is, I guess strongly monetarily based.
b	Right.
sv	But it's just a lot cheaper than Domino's,
sd	McDonald's, we've sort of been off of that for a while
sd	so, we don't go there that much.
^h	A nice meal,
sd	It's usually when we're out of town
sd	and I'll order steak or steak and lobster combined
sd	so it's really not in town.
nn	No.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	But well, we don't go out that much,
sd	and, with my husband traveling he can get all he needs of that during the week going to those places
sd	so, it doesn't really matter to him.
sd	but I think it all began eating out when we had, the boys in different, baseball on baseball tea ,
sd	it was mainly baseball teams
sd	and my husband would coach,
sd	I'm not one that's going to fix, you know, the meal at two o'clock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever they're there.
sv@	If there not there in between five and six, well, then I guess we don't eat today, / * sp:they're
sv	You go somewhere else.
o	Okay .
b	Uh huh,
sd	I'm a big baseball fan too.
sd	I teach school,
sd	and, of course, being a woman, I like romance novels and stuff like that a whole lot.
sd	So I read a lot of that.
sd	And, but, I don't read a lot of nonfiction,
b	Yeah,
bh	do you?
b	Uh huh.
ba	my word.
b	Yeah.
sv	But it's just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so.
b	Yeah.
ba	It's right,
qy	Do you?
sd	When I find an author I really like, I try to read everything they write. Because you get used to their style and you really enjoy it.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Is that right?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
qh	Isn't it amazing that somebody can write that many books about science fiction?
bh	does he really?
b	Oh .
bh	Is that right?
qy	Is that right?
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I would think he would .
aa	I'm sure he is,
b	Yeah.
aa	yeah.
sd	I mean, that's why I like to read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED so much
b	Oh.
qy	So you're probably, a Baltimore fan, right, an Oriole fan?
qy	Is that right?
bh	Boston?
sv	I'm sure you do.
sd	I'm not from here.
b	Yeah.
sd	I love the Mud Hens .
bh	Did you?
b	Yeah.
sd	I know, I know they don't.
sd	they must, they must have changed then. Because it used, well
aa	Yes,
ba	That's for sure,
bh	Is that right?
bh	Is that right?
qw	Well, like how much is an Oriole game?
ba	gosh.
b	yeah.
sd	But, you know, it's in the bleachers, way out you know, in center field,
sd	You still can see well.
sd	Box seats run from, like eight dollars to twelve dollars.
sv	so it'll go up.
b	Uh huh.
sd	yeah, that's a bummer.
sd	Well, see, baseball here though is the cheapest game in town. Because the Cowboys,
sv	And the Mavericks are t ,
sd	So baseball's cheap, compared to other games.
sd	Well, that didn't go over, now.
sd	they, they decided, you know, George Bush, who's the main owner of the Rangers, decided that, they'd stay in Arlington.
sd	So they're going to stay there. Which is fine, because Arlington's got a lot of things to offer.
sd	And it would have devastated them if they would have taken it away.
sd	there's Six Flags right by the stadium, there's a Wet 'n Wild
sd	all the tourists come there.
sd	it would have been devastated,
b	Yeah.
sd	And it's takes us maybe, well, thirty five to forty minutes to get there from Plano, which is not too bad at all.
b	Yeah.
bh	Is that right?
b	Uh huh.
ba	gosh.
b	Yeah.
ng	Well, not really.
sd	and he reads everything he gets his, get his hands on.
sd	I never heard that one.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'll have to tell my son about that.
ba	that would be good
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	And I don't have a problem at all with employers, testing in the hiring process,
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	absolutely.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	I wish they would.
aa	I know.
aa	No.
b	Yeah,
sd	and, you know, our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a pool
sd	so I've already been tested once when I was hired and once since they initiated this random testing program.
sd	But I work with one girl who was tested, her name got randomly selected three times in six months
sv	and I think that's the only reason I have a problem with it, when you know, there's no reason to suspect someone, you know.
sv	that's getting a little bit,
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	Either just the lucky or the unlucky one, depending on how you look at it.
aa	absolutely,
sv	it could really get out of hand.
b	Yeah.
sd	I'd just I'd feel really uncomfortable.
b	Yeah,
sd	but out on the line, they've got people working some serious equipment.
^2	Put at risk.
sv	And in the long run, we're all paying for that
sv	so I mean, it protects us in the long run hopefully when they do that.
sd	I was trying to remember, there was a court case, here where I live, just a few months ago.
sd	and it's still tied up in the legal channels.
ng	Well, it's the whole city,
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I don't believe that.
b	Uh huh.
nn	no,
ny	Uh huh.
sd	N C State.
sd	well, it's a lot of work .
^2	My Bachelor's.
sd	it's actually in computer science
sd	and I have a special interest in Voice I O.
nn	No,
ny	Uh huh.
sd	the service.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Ooh.
sd	It would have played a major part in mine.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Golly,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh,
sv	so depending on what your major is, or medical, you might want to attend somewhere like Tech
sd	well some schools may even give you financial aid, where another one won't.
b	really.
ba	Wow, that's great.
qy	Was it a Pell grant?
qw	What kind of grant was it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
sd	there's a lot of different organizations who do give grants,
 b	Uh huh.
o	another thing.
sd	and, something that might play a part is the size of the college.
sv	the smaller schools can give you a lot more specialized instruction and attention than the larger schools
sv	in the larger schools you get caught up in the bureaucracy,
sd	instead of a scholar you get a T A
sv	and, you don't get near the, quality of education ,
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it's really a shame because of, you know, the instruction
sd	I'd rather go to any other college, you know, in the state,
sv	It's kind of unfortunate, because they've just grown so big that they just don't care about the students any more.
b	Yeah,
 %	and,
sv	it's really a bad situation here.
ba	wow.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
qw	What kind of a car do you have now?
sd	My car is really old, too,
sd	and, I would like my next car to have good gas mileage.
sd	And, same here,
sd	While we're talking, my next car, I'd like to be sporty and, you know nice,
sd	but, you know, it's expensive
b	Yeah.
nn	no
b	Yeah,
sd	I don't plan on buying a car for many, many years
sd	I have to make this one last as long as I can.
qy^d	in Kenosha? .
ny	Yeah,
 sd	Well, we don't have any snow here now.
sd	It all melted.
ny	Yeah.
ad	don't tell me that .
sd	Well, actually, it's been warm,
b	Yeah,
sd	and it's supposed to rain tomorrow
sd	And now there is no snow,
sd	I haven't really thought about it.
qy^d	for a car?
sd	Probably blue. Like if it, you know, was just an average, middle class car.
sd	But if I were to get a sports car, maybe white or red .
b	Yeah.
sd	it's a Sky Hawk Buick.
sd	Eighty three,
ny	Yeah,
ny	Yeah.
sd	I'm afraid it's not going to last me that long
sd	It's a two door.
nn	no,
ba	I'm sure,
ny	Yep.
sd	It was busy .
b	Yeah,
sd	so that was nice .
sd	you hit,
sd	I am pro capital punishment except that I don't like the way it's done.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I agree.
sv	I think it needs to be something, a throwback to where they did a, public execution where it's visible.
sv	something, you know, not gruesome
sv	No stays of execution.
bf	Notoriety.
b	yes,
sv	They know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years.
sv	That they are going to write a book.
sv	of any notoriety.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
ar	Well, yes,
b	,
b	Yeah.
sv	But there's a greater chance that he'll be back out on the streets in twelve years.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
sv	Why, you know, y , you could carry it to that if they are a repeat offender
sd	and of course of battery or assault or, that is not a capital crime see.
sv	Now China and a few other countries have a little different view of that.
sv	there is no appeals.
b	Uh huh .
b	Right .
b	Uh huh.
sd	And then I've seen some of the STAR TREK movies.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	I don't think I've even heard of that show.
qy^d	It's called MCGYVER?
qw	And what is he?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
ba	great.
sd	Well, I used to watch SIXTY MINUTES as a matter of fact,
sv	But, unfortunately I find getting rid of your T V set, you do throw out some of the baby, with the bath water.
sd	And I just decided I had to do that. I think, in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Right,
sv	Well that would be a shame.
b	Huh.
b	Yeah.
b	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh,
b	Okay.
b	Yeah.
sd	I'm not sure it was that great for my children,
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I'm trying to think if I ever even had a favorite one at one time,
qy^h	is that the one where he always got this tape recording that self destructed?
b^m	MISSION,
b	Yeah.
aa	Right.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sd	well I guess, I have to admit that I am .
b	I see.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
fc	Yeah.
b^m	Garland, Texas.
bk	All right.
sd	I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina.
b	Yeah,
fc	Same here.
fc	Bye bye.
qy	Do you like to cook?
sd	I do too.
ny	Yes.
ng	I don't have a family,
sd	that's really weird that you said that because for a dinner party, mine is a, is a chicken in a marsala wine sauce,
qw	so . Where did you get your recipe for it?
bk	okay.
ny	Yeah,
sd	And, the cafeteria is real good about putting out recipes, you know, like once a month,
sd	And they put this one out
ny	Yeah,
sd	And it's a, it's a red wine.
sd	And, I'm trying to think what else.
sd	and, then I rub the chicken with a little bit of oil, and pour the wine sauce over it like the last twenty minutes, so that it gets just enough flavor.
b	Right.
sd	And, it's really easy too
qw	What do you use ?
br	Huh?
sd	I like to serve, a wild rice with it.
ba	This is really neat.
sv	Well, I just don't think you can go wrong with something like that.
qw	what?
ny	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
bh	What time should we be there? .
sd	I love desserts,
sd	I try to avoid making anything that, too fancy, that, we'd like too much and eat too much .
sd	But I guess one that I really like, that I haven't made in awhile,
sd	And you take a, sugar cookie, recipe, and spread it out on a pizza pan.
sd	So you make it like a pizza crust,
sd	and excuse me, you use cream cheese and a little bit of orange juice
sd	and then you layer your fresh fruit on that.
ny	Yeah.
sv	It is really good,
sd	depending on the fruit you use you know, it's real colorful.
sd	Especially with like the kiwi and the strawberries.
sd	but usually I just opt for brownies and vanilla ice cream .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh!
aa	No,
sv	it's really good,
sd	And we eat out a lot
sd	and I wish I had something a little bit different, to just zap together.
b	Uh huh.
qy	I was going to say, do you just mix it to taste?
bk	Okay.
qw	How long, does it keep,
b	Yeah,
fa	I'm sorry I keep coughing.
qy^d	Plain?
ba	I'll bet that is really good.
fe	Man,
sd	and I have been debating what to cook because one of my guests is a vegetarian.
sd	I think we'll try to do something a little bit,
b	Yeah.
sd	when they come down I'll grill those and brush on a little lemon butter sauce
sd	and, definitely go with, it will have to be a rice dish lots of vegetables, to make up for the lack of meat.
nn	No
b	Yeah.
sd	That's what I was just thinking,
qw	where did you get,
qw	where did you get this cook book?
ba	Really!
sd	I'll might have to visit the State Book Store.
sd	I haven't either.
b	Okay.
sd	Well, the ones that I've been wanting to get,
sd	I've been wanting to get those because we eat a lot of chicken,
sd	and we do eat a lot of pasta.
sd	So, we just said the other night it wouldn't be too difficult to do without red meat.
sd	You know, we don't have that much of it now.
b	Yeah,
sd	We used to stir fry a lot, especially, a lot of chicken and a lot of rice dishes.
b	Yeah.
sd	And at least cook a couple of dishes ahead.
sd	So that we can have those to enjoy.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes.
sd	And we have a share alike column in the paper, where people, you know, write in and share recipes or write in and say I'm looking for this recipe,
sd	and that's where I get a lot of my recipes.
ny	Yes.
sd	it's a baked bean recipe.
sd	And, you mix baked beans and Lima beans
ny	Yeah.
sd	and you just bake it.
sd	And, you can add hamburger if you want, to give it a little more body.
sv	So, I try to always keep my eyes open because a lot of time you can find really good recipes where you wouldn't even think about it.
sd	So, I try to always keep a little notebook in my purse.
b	Yeah,
sd^t	I tried to make calls two different days
bh	Does it?
sd^t	so I just hang up. Because it keeps going through the thing over and over again.
sd	But I knew as soon as I heard your voice,
^h	Well, let's see,
b	Yeah.
sd	and it was called, SMART WOMEN, I think. or something like that.
sd	I really didn't like it at all.
sd	And it was all this, divorced woman syndrome of the,
sd	it was almost like a pre AIDS scare kind of thing.
aa	It was really an interesting,
sd@	And it was all about women searching for themselves. * two utts? And, you know, a lot of hanky panky, going on.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	but she has been writing for adults also,
sd(^q)	and so I thought hey, I'll just try this, you know, and see what it was like.
sv	the style was very conversational.
sd	You would have lots of conversations between people rather than any description.
qh	You know how that is,
ny	Yeah,
sd	and I think it was an adult book.
sd	but that's the last thing I've read,
b	Yeah.
qy	WUTHERING HEIGHTS?
b	yeah,
aa	Yes.
b	Yeah.
sd	And then when Jennie had to read it at Gettysburg I got her someone,
sd	I think it was, some actress reading it.
sd	You know, they had an abridged version of it on tape.
sd	And so I got that for her,
sd	But I remember that was the book.
sd	And now I mean, I think it's around here somewhere,
sd	I'm just going to have to put it, in the car sometimes and listen to it.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
b	yeah.
ba	how neat.
ba	great.
b	Uh huh.
ba	great.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
bf	it's a brand new book.
ba	that would be wonderful to read something like that.
b	Yeah.
b	Yes.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
ba	Wow, that's rough.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think that's probably sort of a thing to do in small colleges,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b^m	All different.
ba	that's interesting.
ba	Gosh.
ba	Boy, you really lift me up to a different,
sd	I live down in the south western part of Blacksburg.
b	Uh huh,
sd	V P I.
 b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, we retired early
sd	so, we take trips pretty often.
sd	Well, we go to Maine every Fall
sd	then that's kind of a family visit and a vacation all up and down the coast
sd	and I have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico,
qh	Is that right .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	good,
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
qy	Ever go up in Pennsylvania in the mountains
b	Oh.
na	I've heard of it.
 b	Uh huh.
ba	Gee.
b	Uh huh.
qh	did you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 aa	Yeah .
b	Yeah.
sd	You can go, to the buildings and not go in if you're not,
ny	Yeah,
ba	That's right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	We really didn't do that really this time, we just, visited around.
b	Oh .
qy^g	That's great as a kid though, isn't it, I mean,
b	Uh huh.
 b	Right.
qy	Have you ever,
ba	that's good,
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Charleston is a really nice place to visit.
b	Uh huh.
b	are you.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	okay,
b	Oh .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
sd	Well, I don't know what our next trip will be, I guess our next,
sd	the first one,
sd	so my next trip is going to be to Texas .
b	Yeah,
sd	Well, they'll be air conditioning anyway
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's it,
b	I see.
bh	Is that right.
sd^t	and she's, working on this project too,
sd	and, we got back Monday
b	Uh huh.
b	does, she,
b	Uh huh,
 %	Well .
qy	Are you a golfer?
sd	Me either.
nn	No,
sd	Just walking that's all .
sd	No professionals .
sd	there's one in Salem, Salem Rebels.
sd	Salem Rebels,
b^m	Buccaneers.
qy	is that right up there in Frederick?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've never been up there.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
nn	No
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qo^d	how does he do serious.
sd	I've only seen him in funny stuff
b	Yeah,
no	I didn't see the movie,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	I think the last movie that we went out to see was DANCES WITH WOLVES.
b	Good,
sd(^q)	It was telling a friend, I said, I only cried twice,
^h	let's see,
sd	I cried the first time when the wagon man got killed, when they attacked him.
sd	And, I think from there on, all the way through the movie.
sd	I don't remember when the horse got killed.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Unfortunately we don't have any animals,
sv	there was a lot of pretty scenery, too, in that movie.
qw^d	What did you think about the buffalo scenes.
aa	That was,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh,
sv	I thought the scenes when the buffalos running, though, were beautiful,
sd	And there were so many of them.
sv	So that was pretty.
b	Yeah.
sd	I wonder how they kept up with them, though,
sd	I guess they graze, though,
nn	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sv	I guess they're just not domesticated,
ba	Well that's funny.
qy^d	is that five minutes,
bk	Okay,
b	Okay,
fc	Well thank you for calling.
fc	And I hope you enjoy some more good movies late ,
fc	Bye, bye.
aa	okay .
na	I do have some thoughts on that,
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
b	Well, right.
aa	Exactly.
aa	exactly.
ba	That would be lovely.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, that's an interesting thought because,
sv	That would be okay .
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
aa	I agree with that.
sd	I definitely think they should be tested.
sd	I was tested, within my company.
sd	and I feel like it's really just within the United States.
sd	And once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you're not. I think they could, save money by not doing that. You know, every time,
b	Oh.
ng	not if it's done fairly.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, they might tell you it's random.
sv	But then, you know, it's kind of like a lottery.
b	I see.
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	Well, I'm an environmental engineer
sd	and I've been drug tested three times
nn	No.
sv	so, see it's really strange.
b	uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bk	okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah
sv	I think so.
b	Okay,
fc	Bye.
qw	What kind of recycling programs do you have in Rowlett?
 sd	Plano's doing real good on that.
sd	and of course it doesn't fit right now.
sd	But now we start in May, breaking it down,
sd	and we put that in disposable bags,
qy	Well, does your,
qy	Well, down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your, you know, pop cans, and things like that?
bf	So you don't have much choice there.
sd	Well I work at, J C Penny
sd	and they're going to recycle them.
sd	And then like, the week before that, they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good, bring it in
sd	and they put them right near where they have the time cards.
sd	And it works great.
sd	So they're really going at it,
 b	Uh huh.
qy	Well, did you watch the program the other night on, was it SAVE AMERICA?
sv	It was good.
sd	But I've already gone to,
sd	But I didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water.
sd	That was surprising to me.
sd	Well, I was in, Bizmart the other day,
sd	but people aren't buying it,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Now, see that's recycling, you know,
sd	So that people would use this stuff over again.
sd	It's like when he was saying, which one was recyclable, which was reusable,
sd	and the recycle ones are better to use,
sv	And if we're going to really do something, they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it.
 sv	You have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd	along that same line, they said they were using,
sd	And I thought, well, that's good.
^h	something else was made out of old tires,
sd	And just anything, to, you know, recycle rather than keep throwing it away,
sd	I'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out.
sd	You know what I'd like to see a little more.
sv	but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now, in five years, when they get bigger, it'll work a little bit more, too.
sv	we've all got to do it right now.
sd	I don't think I can keep my own garbage.
qy^d	When you say that you grew up, in the sixties I take it that was the, teenage type years
bk	Okay,
sd	essentially I was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that for one reason or another I didn't pay much attention to music,
sv	I think in a way one could talk about Simon and Garfunkel that way because they do tend, to have a dramatic or story approach to their music, usually tend to have some good or bad moral to it.
sd	it's something that interests me, combined with the classical tastes I had mentioned.
sd	I listen to some country and western
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	I find it very interesting that some television shows that I enjoy I particularly like the music.
sd	and I found that I really like CHINA BEACH
sd	and I, I've, THIRTY SOMETHING I'm particularly interested,
ba	That could well be.
sd	and if you recall how it goes downtown,
 +	ta, da, da, da,
 sd	and my family now knows if they come into my study and, I happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe I'm trying to get a project done, at school, and I'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to Downtown they know to just stay away,
sd	They can hear the unconscious music signal behind it,
ba	that's right.
sd	probably about first grade,
sd	and I have, returned about every four or five years to thinking that I would like to do something about it.
aa	It is.
sd	keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times I bang on them.
sd	but in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since I have pretty high math aptitude
b	Uh huh.
b	,
sv	So we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance,
sv	That's the most fascinating thing .
fc	And you, sir,
fc	take care.
ng	I don't know that it's so much a military threat anymore as a,
sv	it takes awhile to get used to something,
 b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	And, , you know, I'd like to think that that isn't true
sv	It's just the whole thing is so incomprehensible,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
 b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	What I haven't seen is you know, a great stepping back in the military, situation.
sv	You know, it's one thing, you know, to let us go ahead and sort of disarm
sd	Of course, it didn't turn out that way.
sv	And, that may have been a, a kind of far out way of thinking about it I don't know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And the tanks came in and, you know, pretty much took care of that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	well, the social structure of the Soviet Union, you know, it's, it's coming apart at the seams.
sd(^q)	You know, and I've heard people say, well, you know, it's just like the American Civil War, will there be a union or not?
sd	man , those people didn't vote to become part of the Soviet Union,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	And some of the countries that were forced in at later dates is the three Baltic countries, you know, came in the forties,
sd	and, well, it's not that they came in, it's they were conquered by the Germans,
^2	and then the Russians even, took it back from the Germans and never bothered to give it back, you know,
sv	so. That's a, a little different situation.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I knew a lot of guys in the service when they were sent to Germany they said that's the safest place in the world because if a war starts, all the bombs are going to go right over Germany
b	Yeah,
 sv(^q)	You know, some reason or other, you know, is, it's kind of a strange thing we've been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say, whoa, wait a minute,
qh	you know. What's, what's, what's really happening here.
sv	But you wonder how, well, this thing,
b	Uh huh.
sd	you know, and these were all the Soviet economists, you know, they had some real fancy names for them.
b	yeah,
sd	you know, so there would be nineteen, rather than one.
sd(^q)	And, the United States said, well, that mean we get to bring in forty eight, you know.
b	Yeah,
sd	you can change the name of something
sd	Although, I've seen some evidence that, you know, the, the Russian soldiers are,
sd	and now all of a sudden they're going home
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	That's a tough question.
sv	Well it has no credibility any more.
sd	Well, I'm a school teacher,
ba	good for you,
sv	Well, you know, it's interesting, because when I heard the topic, I was thinking,
sd	and one woman had four children,
sv	that's frightening
sd	and, you know, it was almost from the audience participation it was almost a social issue, you know
sd(^q)	people were siding with the husband, saying, You've got to go to work, if you have these four children, you've got to support them,
ba	That's true.
ba	That's true.
b	Yeah,
^h	and, gosh, I'm trying to think,
sd	Six, seven and eight.
sd	In Richardson.
bk	okay.
ny	yeah.
ny	Uh huh.
na	Well, he stays with me
sd	and I have a tendency to work late.
sd	so he stays with me until five thirty and then goes home
sd	and, you know, I have lots of kids, because they know I'm there late
sd	I'm a slow mover to say the least,
sv	and, it makes a difference,
no	I don't know.
sd	And they're back to work,
sv	and we lived without them,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I didn't realize that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
sd	every now and then there's an error
b	Yeah.
sd	Everyone coming in, goes through the drug testing procedure
sd	So if they test for drugs.
sd	I'm, I can't even remember if we do random sampling anymore.
sd	but I guess you're always on call for it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
qy^d	So your big beef with it is the,
sv	Make sure it's a lot safer because a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever.
 +	I, I tend to agree with you David.
b	Okay,
sv	Good company,
sd	he's telling me about good profit sharing and all that,
ba	It's good news .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
bk	Okay,
na	Right,
nn	no,
b	Yeah,
qo	what about,
b	Right.
qw	Where do you live?
qy^d	In Plano?
sd	In Dallas.
sd	the air pollution isn't too bad in our area.
sd	I haven't either.
sv	Well, I think it would be terrible to live in an area like that
sv	Particularly in the areas where there are industries, where they are burning a lot of coal, and oil more up north, I guess,
sv	I think it's a bigger problem. With the car pollution, anti pollution devices,
qy^d	From acid rain?
sd	I think in the emissions, it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere, and form a weak acid.
sd	It just makes the rain fall on the acid side
sd	What's interesting, several years ago, I took a course, on, well,
h	So, I don't know.
qy^g^c	Well, we've got a problem on the line, don't we.
b	Uh huh.
sd^c	I can't hear you at all for all this static.
sd^c	Now I can again.
b@	Uh huh. .
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
 +	in the future, I think, maybe to help in some ways.
sd	It's just we can't control it.
sd	I do to.
sv	We have one earth, to live on
sv	and we got to take care of it.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And so, if we can raise you know, generations with those concerns, we'll solve a lot of our problems.
nn	No,
sd	And, and it's sort of always worked.
sv	but that depends, you know, on the individual if they can I guess have self control.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Well, yeah,
sd	well, we've been married almost thirty years now
aa	Right.
aa	No.
nn	No.
sd	or you get paid the last day or next to the last day.
sd	You pay all your bills
b	Well, yeah,
sd	or we are paying them off now.
sd	there was a time when maybe we didn't take all of them off,
sd	but you just sort of had to watch what you put in, because you hate to pay those finance charges, when you see how much it is.
sd	I mean I'm a substitute teacher,
sd	And, it works for me
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, we eat out a good deal at this point.
sd	I started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved, all that money because I knew that you couldn't, you know, spending, five thousand dollars on a vacation, or whatever.
sd	We were going to go for ten weeks, in nineteen eighty
sd	so I started, working in nineteen eighty seven and just saved, for three years.
sd	what minuscule amount I made
aa	Yes.
sv	And so I think that that's difficult for most people,
sd	and, you know, you never could afford anything although we could afford everything if he wanted to.
ny	Yes.
sd	And I never worried about saving money because we're in the savings plan at work
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, we never had too much of that
sd	but then we never had any really emergencies that,
sd	And we didn't buy really new or expensive cars.
sd	And they were mainly used cars.
b	Yeah,
no	Well, each time they used to call in and tell me their space is limited and to please,
sd^t	It's on your favorite T V shows and why.
sd	MAJOR DAD.
sd	I love it,
aa	That's ri ,
qw	What kind do you like to watch?
qy	WONDER YEARS?
sd	I like both of those real much also.
aa	I do, too.
sd	and, that's one of the reasons,
sd	which just, I was, I always felt was wonderful
sv	and so many of them nowadays, like I said, I think are just,
sv	they go after, well,
b	Yes.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I enjoy those also, almost as much to a certain extent.
sd	and, we enjoy that,
ny	yeah,
sd	probably the Pirates,
sd	otherwise I really don't care that much,
sd	live in Plano.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Well, yeah,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	so many of them now, you know, it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in,
sd	and I have adult tastes now,
sd	I like things that, are wholesome, I guess.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
^h	let's see.
na	on occasion. On occasion.
sd	I do vary.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
sd	So, I predominantly wear flat shoes.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	yeah
b	Yeah,
aa	yeah,
sd	And sometimes I wear a blazer with them,
sd	their attire is always the same, you know. Suits or slacks, you know, jeans, whatever.
sd	but I'm really the only woman, I guess, at work that does that,
sd	In fact, I, I just got a new outfit as a gift that,
sd	So, I think that'll be good for work, too.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	But, you know, I do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses.
ba	my .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Okay?
fc	Okay,
fc^m	Bye bye.
o	Okay.
b	Okay.
aa	Ye , Yes,
sv	it is .
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	It's too easy to run into the gas station.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	so, but I haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards.
aa	Yeah.
ba	That's true,
 %	I try to,
sd	And you don't have an annual fee there,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b^m	Takes a long time,
sv	And now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off your income tax that's, you know.
sd	Of course it's been going down for a number of years,
fc	Okay.
fc^m	Bye bye.
sv	the first one is we need people in there that understand, numbers. The numbers that are being thrown around when we're talking in trillions of dollars. which is an astronomical sum
sv	and the people that are talking this numbers have no concept of what that number means.
sd	The elected people.
sv	our, our Senate and Congress and people that deal everyday and what's going to be done with those monies and don't really understand what that is or how a budget even works.
sv	we need to elect people that are more,
sv	Well, let's make them have a degree in or economics.
nd	Well ,
b	Yeah.
sv	the, lobbyists, needs them to be eliminated, from Congress.
sv	They don't make pragmatic decisions.
sv	you know, or they tack on this, pork bellies and do things that are good for their area to pass something that is not good for the country.
na	I definitely would.
sv	I think that any company or anything that wants to contribute to a fund should be able to do that, and be registered with what they ever contribute.
sv	But they should not have a one on one relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them.
sv	that's a conflict of interest as far as I'm concerned.
sv	When you are talking again, billions and trillions of dollars you're jeopardizing the future of the country, for today.
na	I think to bring it in line you are going to have to have a generation that's going to really bite the bullet to bring it in line.
h	I forget the figures on the interest rate
 sv	Part of the problem is we don't loan from ourselves.
sv	and I, I really feel that, that is part of the problem that we've let things get so out of control that we don't want to put the brakes on them.
sd	by having a, a budget is feasible, that is reasonable.
ba	of course.
sv	One thing we could do is give a ten percent income tax.
na	That's right.
bf	You pay a ten percent income tax.
sv	That's what you pay
sv	if you make forty dollars, you're going to pay four dollars.
nd	I don't know that it would or wouldn't.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you ever keep any of your stuff?
sd	I do crochet and a lot of, things like that,
ba	Ooh.
sv	that would be definitely something you'd want to keep.
qr	was the whole face done or just the numbers, and, and, } like minute marks?
b	Oh.
sd	I did some needlepoint years ago,
sd	Well, it's an Italian, needlework, using the
sd	and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors.
sd	What I did, when I was doing that was mostly pillows, you know, for sofas and so forth,
sd	It's one of those things
sd	I was so proud of them when I got them finished,
sd	Bargello.
sd	I suspect you, I suspect you have.
sd	Me, too.
aa	Yes .
qh	How did you know to choose this subject, tonight.
qy^d	Like fabric that's been stiffened.
aa	Yes.
sd	I've seen some,
sd	When I do, crochet, it's usually the lacy Victorian type things like that,
sd	and I stiffen those with a glue mixture.
sd	There's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that's very similar that's not going to melt too much with, high humidity, in a room,
qy	Do you know what my concern is?
sd	That's terrible.
sd	So many of my crafts,
sd	And most of my things are dust collectors .
sd	So first thing I think of is how easy would this, thing be to clean.
b^m	you don't have time.
sv	You definitely don't have time.
sd	I have a similar problem.
sd	And so I end up lots of time not doing anything at all.
qy^g	You just didn't say which Christmas, right .
qw	What was this project?
qy^d	Now this is done in the needlepoint?
aa	Yes.
sd	I have done a little bit of that,
sd	And so I've got to have almost total silence.
sv	It does not sound like an easy one to finish.
sv	I'm sure you'll get it done,
^2	Just hard finding the time that can be dedicated.
qy	do you use I mean, like a book of patterns,
o	Okay.
sd	That's what I would do, too.
sd	Or whatever I have.
b	Ooh.
qy^d	What. With ink?
bk	okay.
ba	that sounds really neat.
sd	did you use, like, a stamp pad and ink.
sd	just like being finger printed ...
fe	gee,
sd	So, I believe them
no	I don't really know,
na	I understand it very well
sd	and I can remember etched clearly in my mind, flying and coming up above the smog layer at about three thousand feet and looking back down and really being unbelieving at, what looked like a,
sv	it just looked liked peanut butter.
sd	Thick and brown and so on.
na	This was quite a few years ago.
sd	People say that it is somewhat better.
qy	So did it burn coal?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sv	I don't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals. maybe just take good care of our cars, and make sure we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing.
sd	apart from that, I don't know what we can do as individuals.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	And in the case of air pollution, it simply might turn out at some point down the road, to be so costly to have to live with air pollution in terms of health problems, and everything else that we'll spend the money that's necessary to get rid of the source of it.
b	Yeah.
sv	People also have to realize they can't have their cake and eat it.
sv	Well we don't want that either.
qh	How about investing in the sun.
sv	I probably wouldn't mind if it really came down to it.
aa	yes,
aa	Yes.
aa	certainly,
b	Yeah.
ng	There's not really a lot here in Raleigh.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
b^r	Yeah.
aa	Right,
fc	and I enjoyed the conversation.
fc	Bye.
aa	I agree.
ny	yes.
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	so I get a check back
sd	from taxes
aa	Yeah .
nn	No.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
 sv	They have nice plans
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh.
b	Right,
b	Right,
aa	Yeah,
aa	I will agree to that.
nn	no
no	I have no idea,
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah .
ny	Yeah,
sd	well, the one I was just on, I don't,
sd	They are probably still in deliberations on it.
sd	But, what I found out,
sd	And, he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy
sd	So he was caught
sd	county I live in the past ten years only had two capital murders.
sd	And last year there were six
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	from what I can tell. I mean, I didn't talk to the guy or anything,
sv	So, it's kind of strange that, you know,
nn	No,
b	Yeah.
sd	I was the, I think the ninety eighth person they'd interviewed.
sd	But, you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone
sd	But they really did.
sd	Well, that was a subsequent case that we didn't know about. And those jurors don't know about.
sd	But this particular case, I mean, they had a complete confession from the guy with a lot of things that the police hadn't released
sd	so no one else would have known.
sd	it was really pretty interesting.
sd	Educational.
sd	Well, they can, I think in the punishment phase but not in the guilt or innocence because he hasn't been found guilty of it.
 b	Right.
b	Right,
ny	yeah,
sd	and in Texas there is a couple of questions you have to ask, in the punishment phase.
sd	So there is a lot of outs,
b	Yeah .
b	Yeah,
bh	But what is it worth?
sv	Personally I don't know which I would pick if I had a choice for myself.
b	Yeah,
qy	And do they have the death penalty there?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b@	 Yeah.
ba	Ooh.
ba	That's right.
sd	I grew up in the deep south like south Alabama.
sd	And there would be like thirty people.
sd	so I mean, how I would go about doing it is I would just call all my relatives.
sd	my father has, five sisters and two brothers
sd	And I grew up in a real I think not normal setting.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
h	I don't know how much I know about this subject .
b	Yeah.
b	Okay.
b	Yeah .
ba	That's true.
sd	me either.
nn	No,
ny	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
ny	Uh huh.
sd	I know that also one of my cousins who, he is in like the therapy type thing
sv	I think that's a good way you know, maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I really don't know that much about it,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sv	But it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I don't know that that would work if, somebody's, didn't really want to be there and didn't have,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Down here with the Peace Corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that I think probably need help and, could be helped.
b	Yeah.
sv	And maybe rather than just, require somebody to join like the Peace Corps for a year maybe like, during college, you know, maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the United States.
sv	There probably are, you know,
b	Yeah .
b	Yeah.
^2	Or, you know, to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves,
sv	I mean, I guess we're getting kind of off the subject, , here,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
na	Flower Mound,
b	okay.
b	I see,
qy^d	Every year.
ba	How about that.
b	Yeah,
sv	Well, it's kind of same for me,
sd	And they were like thirty miles right up the river
b	Yeah.
sd	Boy they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
b	I guess, yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I guess since Staubach left, they haven't been able to, keep it going.
sd	Well, that says a lot for his ability, though I think. For Staubach's, I mean.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bf	So, obviously though, do you think they're going to do anything in the playoffs to make it to the Super Bowl this year
qw	So who's going to beat them?
sd	Boy, they'd some big changes, speaking of them.
b	Yeah.
sd	Those guys are tough.
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean, I wasn't pulling for either team.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	L A you mean?
ny	Yeah
^h	boy I was just up there,
sd	And it snowed all day.
aa	yeah,
fc	Yeah,
fc	Hey,
fc^m	Bye.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I do the easy stuff now.
sd	Well, that's part of it
b	Uh huh.
ng	Well, on this car I've got now, no,
sd	But fortunately that was covered under the warranty.
aa	yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	Did you take it to a dealership?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
b	Right.
ba	gosh.
sv	It's going to run for a while yet.
sd	I work for T I.
sd	I work in the networking area.
qy	Do you work for T I?
b^m	No,
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
fc	All right, well, I enjoyed the conversation.
fc	All right, thank you.
fc^m	Bye bye.
sd	Well, I know that we have some relatives that live around, like the area in there,
sd	I know they're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there.
b	Huh uh.
^2	they'll help you, recycle, because there is some bins, like behind Wal Mart, that take some things.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Because I finally asked because, you know, we had all of those milk cartons
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	Like aluminum cans?
sd	That's about what we do too.
na	Well, I guess, down kind of in North Dallas, there is a place that will take almost anything.
sd	we just don't have the room to store all that much, you know,
sd	I don't want to be running down there every week, or whatever.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I guess we kind of started recycling after I moved here about a year and a half ago.
sd	We were using baby food
sd	Some of our neighbors were doing it
sd	so, you know, if I'm not going to get the money for aluminum, I would just assume give it to the city of Flower Mound. to do something with, you know.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
nn	No,
b	Yeah.
sd	She'll be two in July.
b	Oh.
fc	Well, it was nice to talk to you.
ny	Yeah.
fc	Okay.
ng	Well, I don't do anything with the lawn really,
sd	we have enough property that we can have a little bit of a garden
sd	So would I .
ny	Yes,
sd	so I manage to fit in my gardening chores afterward,
sd	and I can still do some sorts of things
aa	absolutely .
ba	Wow.
ba	that's wonderful.
sv	and you really feel you can accomplish something
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	but I know people who do it and enjoy it very much.
b	Oh.
ba	My word.
ba	For heaven's sake.
sd	Well, there aren't men's gardening clubs in this area that I know of,
sd	But, flowers are primarily the emphasis, whereas I enjoy vegetable gardening almost more, I do flowers sort of look pretty
sd	but I really like to do the vegetables.
br	Being what?
ba	my.
b	Yes.
ba	terrible
aa	Okay.
 +	and then I have a shady area that I need to, be concerned about not getting something that has to have sun,
sd	but I like the vinca which is something I hadn't,
nn	No.
sd	but in the vegetable garden we grow, usually, what
sd	Well, you know why, because I grew up in North Carolina,
sd	and that was my mother's, favorite bean
sd	but that's the kind that produces the best.
sd	and they're wonderful,
sd	and they're good both ways.
b	Yeah,
b	yeah,
b	yeah.
sd	Well, my mother doesn't think they have any flavor the way I cook them .
ba	of course.
aa	Yeah,
ba	my gosh.
sd	But she doesn't have that big a garden,
 sd	And I have four children, you know,
ny	yes,
aa	it is,
sd	We also grow, yellow and green squash, much to my children's chagrin,
 sd	and, we grow a lot of tomatoes,
sd	there's just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes.
sd	So, we enjoy that,
sd	I'm going to do it again.
ba	That's right.
sd	And I have been very, happy about the new way of controlling the, worm that gets in broccoli, by using the Bacillus Thuringiansis which is the, little,
sd	But you know, it's a problem that's moving south from the New England area.
sd	And they devastate the trees
sd	So, that's the same technique that is, you know, for any of the other, little varmints that get in vegetables
sd	Well, it's nice hearing you talk
sv	so, well, that's not very long.
b	Yes.
ba	that's great,
sd	Well, I hope you have an opportunity to garden again.
ba	well, good .
fc^m	Bye bye.
sd	Well, I guess I'm more concerned about public safety than I am about the concern for the private, the idea of, preserving privacy for, the individual,
sd	because I can't really see why anyone, who has nothing to hide would object.
ba	of course, that is certainly true,
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
qy^d	If you had to have a drug test?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
^2	Checked out or whatever.
sd	But it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that.
sv	but I would think that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that.
sv	Because, there must be people like you, or in other circumstances, that could come up with, false positives for certain kind of drugs.
sv	But, in many cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs, it's not even going to effect anybody but you know, himself and his own family, perhaps, depending on the kind of drug he might be on.
sv	But, and eventually that's going to show up anyway in the way he works, and so on.
sv	But there's so many things that it would make a difference.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
^2	Make it difficult enough.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sv	The people who, have serious problems, I mean,
sd	and it's the son and so on,
sd	Most of these are young people.
sv	and he may never really be a productive member of society.
sv	I mean, you know, he's so messed up.
sd	And, this was a nice, sweet, young man who, teenager, you know,
sd	And, you know, I don't know that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing.
sv	it's horrible.
sv	Well, the limits, would, I think, have to do with what I'd alluded to before, that, that one positive on a drug test, would not constitute, dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might, have set up for those who genuinely have a problem.
sv	In other words, there needs to be, more than,
 %	Pard ,
sv	there needs to be more than one test,
sv	There are lots of things that are involved there, such as, perhaps, insurance you know, denial of insurance for someone,
sv	and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this, that, you know,
sv	because it makes a bigger problem.
sv	I'm not sure, though, when we talk about what rules, if any, that we should say, well, certain segments should not have to be tested.
b	And, yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	would be some measure of protection.
b	Really.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's very true.
b	Yeah.
fc	It was nice talking to you.
fc	Okay,
b	Right,
ba	That's true,
sv	and if they're Republican they vote Republican every year, you know,
b	Yeah.
sd	back when Anderson was running, I was hoping that things would change and he'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes,
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	they each think that, if more people vote, they'll get more votes,
sd	I'm always amazed that each candidate thinks it's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him, you know.
b	Yeah,
sd	and when things start,
sd	and, still on the other hand we're also,
b	Yeah,
sv	and, it doesn't matter who they put in office, they're going to fall subject to, the pressure that the lobbyists can put,
b	Right.
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
sv(^q)	They'll just say, well, you know, the Republicans have this election
sd	hope some of the local,
sd	But, I know, my grandmother hasn't voted in years.
nn	No,
bh	yeah?
b	Yeah .
sd	Washington, D C,
ny	Uh huh.
b	okay.
sd^t	Well, I figured with Texas Instruments they'd probably have a few, Texans on the line now and then.
nn	No,
sd	, they went through engineering companies,
sd	and, we're communications.
b	Yeah.
sd^t	They called me at, ten o'clock one night,
sd^t	I guess they were doing Eastern Standard Time.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
fc	All right, I'll talk to you later .
fc	Bye bye.
bk	okay.
^2	Cab.
b	Yeah .
ba	There you go.
b	Yeah,
b	Right,
b	Yeah,
sv	You're just like me.
aa	No.
sv	Let somebody else break it in,
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	and, it pretty much does everything I need it to.
sd	And, it's real reliable,
sd	And then, of course, two weeks ago, it decided,
sd	Didn't do any damage to it.
sd	ninety seven thousand.
sd	So it's not real early .
nn	No.
sd	Went out and looked.
sd	And that was it
sd	I mean that's sort of my, hobby though more than a vehicle.
ba	I know
b	Yeah.
sd	And I go out twice a week on the bike, so. At least. Just for the enjoyment.
b	But, yeah,
sv	I'm sure that that's very,
 b	Right.
^2	To have it out of the way.
sv	I think they last a lot longer than anything else.
b	Yeah,
sv	I think the Fords tend to last a little longer. At least until recently .
sd	A friend of mine just , bought like a year ago. it's a really nice truck.
sv	it's beautiful.
sv	that thing will last forever I mean ,
b	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I really haven't had, too many problems.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
nn	No.
ad	watch out.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I usually have pretty good luck with appliances,
sd	and the, microwave had to have, some kind of something I can't even pronounce,
na	within two days of each other.
sd	it wasn't a good week.
sd	But I didn't have to worry about all that, because they weren't under warranty.
sd	the only other things that I've ever had trouble with,
ny	Yeah,
bh	really?
ba	That's interesting.
qy	do you test each individual one
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, that's something I've never had to use,
sd	But I think it's a great idea.
sv	I'm sure they want to be thorough before they.
sd	I'm not a real big seat belt,
b	Uh huh.
nn	No,
qy	Do you have children?
ba	that's good.
sd	I have four girls
sd	they're nine and five and three and a newborn.
aa	Yes,
qy^g	Girls are nice, aren't they?
sd	Anyway, as far as clothing goes, my wardrobe changes all the time, depending on my size .
sd	We go from regular kind of spring clothes regular kind of fall clothes pregnant clothes, clothes that are in between where you're not down to regular size yet or you're on your way up from regular size
sd	and they're all in boxes or bags,
sd	I don't, get a whole lot new right now,
b	Yeah.
sv	and it's frustrating,
sv	it works best if they have pleats in the front
sd	my waist is kind of small compared to the hips,
sd	when I was pregnant through the summer this time I wore dresses all the time because it was so much cooler and so much more comfortable not to have something binding on your waist
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	I haven't tried those,
b	Huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
t3	I'm watching, Janice,
b	Oh.
sd	I remember that from when I was,
sv	you've got to have something to add to it or something
sd	I don't know if you can,
sv	You burn up,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	It's hard on the car.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
ba	that's funny,
b	Yeah
aa	That's true,
aa	That's right,
sd	I've always been a creature of comfort, too
sv	if it's not comfortable, forget it.
sv	Wool was never comfortable to me.
sd	well actually, usually, in the mornings I am getting ready to either go to work,
sd	N B C.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
no	Well, what I really don't like about T V, especially local news as compared to like national news is just, it seems like everything is very spoon feed
b	Uh huh.
 sd	it's something wrong.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Was that like he started shooting people in this cafeteria or something?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah,
 b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
 b	Yeah .
b	Yeah,
sd	you know even the national news I just find it to be you know very watered down,
sd	I found it very one sided.
sv	you know, it just seemed to lack any sort of debate.
h	you know, not saying that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Okay,
sv	Well, that's what makes it a powder keg.
sd	naturally we were at the time,
sd	I went to Lebanon in eighty three, before the marines ever got there, with the U N Peace Keeping Force. with the training I received prior to going there, with captured weapons we kept running up against.
sd	In Granada, in October, twenty fifth, eighty three, we invaded the place.
sd	Their military is different from ours, to where there are extremist generals that actually control tens and thousands of troops.
sd	Well, it's interesting watching the different Soviet states, Albania, Lithuania, doing their little revolts down there.
sd	Each one of those sectors has got a Soviet general over the troops that are there.
sv	Actually, they're showing remarkable restraint.
bk	Okay,
sd	You put five Soviet hyundee helicopters in the air, they can level the entire area
qy^d	I take it you haven't spent any time in the military?
sd	As a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military,
qy	But, during that same time frame, didn't you get some feeling, that, I mean, they're getting all these weapons and stuff?
sd	In any of them since eighty one.
sv	It all boils down to, whether it's our side, their side,
sd	The deal the Iraqi's have with the Russians was for oil.
sd	the ones to the south are more regional conflict.
sd	Inflation is out of this world
sv	Unfortunately, Yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard.
 sv	Gorbachev has made his attempt
sv	Yeltsin's in tight with the old guard.
 %	You mean,
sd	It may be a much reduced force than what we used to have over there.
qy^t	Do you usually get a message?
co^t	Hang on let me check on it .
b	Okay.
b	Yeah.
ng	well, not really from, you know,
sd	and besides I like the city.
ny	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	okay.
qy	is that where you are now?
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	my, my, my main sport is baseball
qy^g	Cowboys are going to have a problem aren't they?
qy^g	They don't, have anything high do they?
ba	that's right,
sd	What was I thinking.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
sv	this is the way it is.
qy^g	Because they only won one game the year before, right?
bk	Okay.
nn	no.
sv	they, they got a big thing because of you know, the, the expansion going on in baseball.
sv	But, of course, you know, the, the one, the griping is that you know, if, if Washington doesn't get a baseball team then Baltimore shouldn't get a football team. Which is probably true,
b	Yeah,
sd	well, considering how well he gets along with, Jimmy Johnson that doesn't surprise me.
b	Yeah,
sd	It was the same year that Buddy Ryan got fired.
ny	Yeah.
ar	No.
sd@	it's just west of Baltimore, off Route Seventy. Yeah,
sd	but basical , well, Route Seventy and Route Forty.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
na	The Inner Harbor.
sd	there's a big long railroad shed
sd	but, you know, they're building the baseball stadium
sd	So it's, real easy access from south of Baltimore like the airport or more importantly for the Orioles from Washington D C.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
sd	And, I was not real happy when they, left to go there of all places .
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
na	kind of all over the place but, eas , east coast lately,
qy	Well, have you ever, had a family reunion?
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh .
ba	that's so neat.
ba	great .
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	and then you could get it at the reunion.
ba	nice.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
ba	That is neat.
bh	he does?
sd	That's kind of how my husband and I are.
sd	and that's it.
b	Uh huh.
ba	how nice.
ba	my gosh.
b	Yeah.
ba	How funny.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
^2	Not be able to do it.
b	They did.
qy	Did you put them up in other peoples houses
b^m	They did.
b	Uh huh .
 bh	really?
ba	How nice.
qy	Did they just have like over a weekend?
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I'm real curious because my family,
qw	Huh?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 %	so,
b	Yeah.
ba	Oh!
sd	See, that would be great because then you could spend so much more time together, than if you all were in your own hotels or something.
sd	And then, every time you wanted to go eat with somebody, you'd probably have to go to out, eat or something.
ba	That sounds like fun.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That would be great.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Yeah.
sd	And you have to sit at a table and just,
qy	was it hard to decide who to invite and who not to invite.
qy^d	whoever , wanted to come.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see.
b	yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Sure.
qo	But how about like because of divorce and stuff like that?
sd	and they are both remarried
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I'm kind of like, in control over who comes. just from my family.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
 b^r	I see,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	Yeah.
ba	I bet.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	How neat.
sd	I was just thinking of that. What you could tell your kids.
b	Uh huh.
sd	the thing is I know a lot of stories,
 sd	So, I mean, I couldn't give an accurate,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, mostly right now I do a lot of sports and stuff like that is my hobbies and do a lot of things with my family as much as possible.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sd	I've got a little girl who's six and a little girl that's three.
aa	Yeah.
sd	So, they're, they're looking forward to it.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah .
bh	Really?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bh	Really?
qy	did you like Oklahoma, while you were there?
qw	what did you all do?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
qy	So, is he working there then
b	uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
b	I see.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Her name's Tina .
b	Yeah.
sd^t	I've only talked to one or two
sv	So, that's interesting.
sd	Well, the sport I like best probably is basketball.
sd	But, I play in a couple of leagues and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
na	So to speak.
b	Yeah.
sd	we go through Enid, you know, quite a bit.
sd	And, well, lot of times we take seventy five
sd	I've either seen the signs or,
sd	I know I've seen, the sign somewhere.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	uh huh.
qy^g	And you really like, it there,
sd	I've heard so many people talk about that area.
sd	but they sure, say it's pretty.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And it rains, you know, a lot there.
sd	But, you get used to it.
bh	Really?
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
fc	Well, I have enjoyed talking to you, too.
fc	I hope you enjoy, North Carolina.
x@	, * slash error Yeah . / * slash error
fc	That's what I hope.
fc	Good bye.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you'd like?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
ba	that's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think it's fairly objective
b	Oh.
bk	okay.
b	Yeah,
sv	the newspaper I really been impressed with it when I've read it at times, at, well the LOS ANGELES TIMES. Which I've found to be a very good quality , newspaper
sd	and I like a lot of the articles there.
br	Both?
b^r	Uh huh.
sd*	I never say that. /* listen: should "say" be "saw"?
sv	But it's usually the Prime Minister,
sd	Thatcher,
sv	Which could be another of Monty Python.
sd	I have seen that
o	All right.
qw	And what do they say about finding adequate child care?
b	Right.
ba	Well, we certainly found that to be true.
sd	our children are now eleven and nine.
sd	And we moved away from institutionalized child care if we can call those chain kind of things , like that. by that name. And found that, more creative avenues were the right answer for us.
sd	at one point in time we've had au pairs, by trading services with them,
sd	and that worked for a while,
sd	It takes that mixture of a very mature college student, who wants to do something and yet is willing to give the time, and the interest to the children.
ba	Well, that's true,
sd	and that's something that we're struggling with now.
aa	yeah.
sv	Much as other cultures disagree, our lives don't revolve around our children.
aa	Well, it certainly is.
sd	It is such an honor and a thrill, to be a parent, that most of the time, it's worth it.
sd	Well, I just have to be honest about it.
sd(^q)	There are those times when I think, gee, if I didn't have children I could be out playing bridge or golf.
sd	Well, we were lucky when our children were that age,
sd	And felt that ,
 +	feeling of safety.
sd	And were leaving them small children.
sd	But, we also learned something from that experience as our children got older.
sd	It's that care givers are not omniscient
sd	they are not all things to all people or all children.
sd	The ones that are good with babies tend not to be good with toddlers.
b	yeah.
sd	you don't know what happens after they get in school.
aa	yes.
sd	and the other one, of course can't do the same thing.
sd	It has to be somewhere else
aa	No.
sd	that will not do.
 aa	Of course.
sd	We are being cooperative,
^q	You don't understand this.
sd	That's just the way their minds work.
sd	Well, I've been finding out that I really am a nice person.
sd	And now, I need it.
b	Yeah.
nn	Absolutely not.
sd	I mean, one of them I would leave unsupervised any time, any place, any where.
sd	the other one I wouldn't leave unsupervised two minutes.
ba	That's true.
^q	one leads the other?
na	Of course.
sv	you don't think that good prevails.
sd	we're having such fun,
sd	And we just couldn't wait to have two children so they would be such friends.
ar	Wrong.
sd	Just make good friends.
^2	Have enough.
ba	That's true.
sd	Well, what's frightening is a parent to see things that you don't really don't understand.
sd	And then you don't really know what happened.
sd	We gave up on one baby sitter because we came home one night and found pieces of, ribbon, you know, hair ribbon tied in a chair. Where obviously she had,
sd	I don't, subscribe to any magazines at home, because we get so many at work that, I need to read that, I just don't take any at home.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	But, yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	but otherwise than that, you know, they were, you know, not too useful to me. You know
b	Right.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	But, you know, that's basically just about ,
 b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
 ad	Okay.
sd	actually quite a, a while.
fp	Hello.
fa	I'm sorry
sd	I live in an apartment
sd^t	there it is,
fa	sorry about that .
b	Yeah.
sd	anyhow, they have facilities here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only.
nn	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	so, I mean, a lot of people, you know, right at the vending machines, they have receptacles that, you know, you can just pop your cans in
sd	and near the, Xerox machines they have places, you know, for your, paper,
sd	you know, I keep a little box at my desk, you know,
sd	and as I'm using the white paper, you know, I just throw it right in there,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	so all the monies are donated, you know, for the recycling to Children's Hospital, which I think is an excellent idea, there, you know, because the other, public,
aa	Right,
sd	before they started the recycling plan, which at work they've only been doing since January first of this year, I had had everyone in my department recycling
sd	and then I would haul them, you know, here to this place for the Children's Hospital Fund which got people really going into it,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	you know, I've seen a definite trend, you know, towards more recycling, everywhere, you know, even at McDonald's, you know, with their use of no, foam containers anymore.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah .
fc	Okay,
fc	Okay.
na	I'm a substitute teacher.
qy	is this Pat I'm talking to now?
b	Yeah,
aa	okay.
b	Oh.
sv	Well, I bet you're, you may dress differently, then, for that.
sd	Well, What I wear sometimes depends on how cold I think the school might be or what room I might be in since I'm a sub, and have different rooms to go to. And always carry a sweater.
aa	Yes.
nn	No,
sd	And it's interesting to notice when you go to different schools that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
sd	and you have to have the color for that particular school if you choose to participate in
 +	spirit week.
nn	No,
sd	And then many schools on a particular day during, I guess football season, maybe all year long, they wear the school colors for, game day which,
b	Right,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	But I think it varies, it just so much.
sd	And you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools, like history at Clark, they're all pretty fancy.
sd	And they'll just wear your common, ordinary, you know, whatever you might might say,
b	Right.
sd	And so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there,
^2	Or you're going to be observed.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	But, they don't look, you know, they don't wear their sweat pants or anything.
 sd	Those I can understand.
b	Yeah.
sd	I don't think we'll ever get to that.
nn	No,
sd	It certainly makes it easier to dress.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Yeah,
 +	that that will come about.
b	Yeah,
aa	No
sv	Well, I think it does.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	Well, we talk about it,
ny	yes.
aa	Yes.
sd	I don't mind the spending,
b	I see.
sd	Well, I'm at home also,
sd	Well, we pretty well do.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
na	Well, we had new cars, always until about four years ago,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
ba	no,
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's right .
ba	Wow.
b	Right.
qr	Do you, buy from dealers or from individuals?
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
^h	Well I work for an insurance company
aa	exactly.
sd	When you get one way out like that
sv	You know, they're not going to sit there and lose money.
sv	So it all comes filtering down to us all individually.
sv	And, granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged, you know.
no	I don't know.
sv	I think maybe you look at, the age of the person and their station in life and, how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up, you know, with that.
sv	I think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there.
sv	and that can be part of continuing education, maybe for judges .
h	I don't know. .
sd	You know, to get into the economics of things,
sd	If it's a company, you know that they're insured. Unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages,
sv	I think those should be uninsurable.
b	Yeah.
sd	for honest mistakes where they've done something and something happens.
sd	Well, I was just talking about any company.
sd	and, somebody is on the premises
sd	and one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift
sv	Sure.
ar	Well I'm not talking about any loss.
sd	lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too.
sv	So again, it never really penalizes, the company doing the wrong.
sd	They can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to.
sv	Then I think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket.
sd	I'm at a little bit of a loss,
sd	things haven't changed a whole lot.
sv	People are being I don't know, a little le , a little less bigoted in some ways,
sv	seems to me.
sv	Well, it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted
sd	I lived in Akron, Ohio.
b	Oh.
sd	about eight years.
sv	In fact in the eight years I've been here it seems to me it gets to be more and more restrictive place to live. I think,
b	Yeah,
sd	and maybe that has a lot to do with it.
aa	Yeah,
 sd	you know I'm no longer a teenager in high school.
t3	Hello.
aa	Yeah,
sv	you can't make it,
sd	I guess, when I was growing up, it was still the ideal to get a home and buy house,
sv	you know, you just don't buy a house,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	and sooner or later there's going to be a turn around.
sv	But I think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class,
sv	so, usually is I think.
sd	It's hard for me to say.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I'm in semiconductor.
b	Yeah.
sd	About eight years,
b	Yeah,
sd	Two.
ny	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
qy	Are you D A D or something up there?
b	Yeah,
sd	T A D,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
no	I don't even know
sd	I haven't been up there in years.
aa	No,
ny	Yeah,
sv	Catch them next year probably.
no	I don't know,
b	Okay,
fc	Yeah,
 fc	All righty,
sd	Well, on a scale of one to ten, being ten, no, kind of legislation and zero being, total ban, I probably would lean more towards six or seven.
sd	I lived in Massachusetts for two years
sd	any kind of firearms.
ny	Yeah.
 nn	No,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	and I don't think I probably ever would, although I would like to know how to handle one,
sd	you just never know when you might come into contact with one.
nn	No.
sd	And he lived in Massachusetts and had to get rid of all his guns,
sd	and really my only experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right
sd	And so that was really the only experience that I've had with guns
sd	But I think that if I learn how to use one, I would feel better.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sv	I would definitely support that.
sd	that kind of, to me it is more like vigilantism .
sd	You know, and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on, in L A, on the freeways,
sd	and then you come here in the Dallas area,
fc	Okay,
 sd	Our most recent series of projects I guess, inside was, we remodeled a bathroom recently.
sd	Well, it went pretty well, other than the fact that we encountered some, problems that you run across in older homes with plumbing, which one thing led to another,
sd	It wasn't one of those,
sd	and by the next Sunday it was done.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yes.
sd	Well, that's the thing that surprised me, because once I got into the plumbing everything in there was copper,
sd	and it was all soldered.
sd(^q)	That's what drove me bananas, because, you know, I'm going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and and cement to fit them together
sd	and nothing wanted to go,
b	Really.
sd	I was very fortunate, in the fact that, when I made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on nothing leaked,
sd	everything worked.
sd	Well, I expected something to leak, you know left a fitting loose, or didn't use teflon tape on one of them or something like that.
sd	But it all came together,
qo	How about you?
b	Uh huh.
qw	What kind of paint?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
qy	Was it not washable paint?
b	Uh huh.
qw	What color is it?
b^m	Pink,
qy	Did you, require more than one can of paint?
qy^g	You didn't have to mix paint then, right.
bk	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
qw	How'd that go?
qy^g	Kind of fun, isn't it.
b	Really.
sd	Repeating patterns is what you have to check for when you buy your paper.
b	Yeah.
sd	Normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats.
b	Yeah.
qy	When you did your papering did you start in the middle of the wall?
qrr	Or did you start at the edge?
b	Uh huh.
fp^m	Good morning.
ny	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
na	my kids do .
sd	Put it that way.
sd	So that's been their summer money
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
bf	is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd(^q)	because when the kids first went down, I said, you know that's great
sv	but it's amazing how many cans you go through. And how fast they accumulate.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	And I can't mow the yard with the grass catch on it.
sd	So I just mow it and leave it.
sd	It just soaks in.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I like it better doing it.
sd	and you zip through it quicker.
ba	we probably will.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Really.
sd	what makes me sick is when they show the dump sites you know, and, how big they are.
sd	Or like in New York, the barges that that go up and down the river
sd	and they don't have any place to put it
aa	No.
b	Yeah.
sd	They pick up the plastic, the glass, and the newspaper.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	And they will do the alum ,
nn	No,
sd	The kids keep those .
ny	Uh huh.
 sd	So we don't have the newspapers but the plastic and the glass .
ba	Uh!
aa	It is.
ba	I know.
sd	and, I put them in a big bag anyway
sd	and then they dump the bag out
b	Yeah.
bh	really? .
bf	Compile more statistics.
b	Uh huh.
aa	More especially where you are.
b	Yeah,
b	yeah.
ba	It just really grabs your attention.
sv	It just makes the whole place seem like that.
b	Yeah.
qo	what do you think is causing all this,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Well, yeah,
sv	and then you start making a movie and there's no call for something violent,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	I listened to a radio talk show today at lunch time Rush Lynn Bottom / * sp: Limbaugh
qy^d	I do not know if you listen to him or not,
sd	he's on A M,
sd	and they were just really coming down on him because of just some of the things that he believed in, some of his morals.
sv	it seems anymore that, if you have, you know, this type of a moral stance, that people come down on you.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, nobody feels responsibility to do something.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
qh	How many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between, you know, what you see and how yo ,
sv	I mean, what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do.
b	Yeah,
sv	we have got a lot of that influence.
sv	Well, I think we need to do more.
sd	But I have a hard time of you know, having a place, separating my trash,
sd	and, you know, I just haven't gotten that dedicated yet .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	But, then I just, you know, bundle it up and put it on you know, the front walk ev , you know, every Monday or every other Monday, and have them pick that up,
sd	but that's the extent of what I've done.
sd	it's not always convenient to do it.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do those can crushers work good?
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah
b	Oh.
qy^g	but, you know, for other kind of cans, it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that, don't they.
b	Yeah,
sd	sometimes, even with the newspaper they say they'll only take certain types of paper, you know,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I think they're just fine.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
aa	No,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
t3	Girls, put that away.
b	Yeah,
sd	you know, seems like you're so busy anyway,
sv	I think if, you know, the cities, locally, you know, they'd get more programs going so that you could do that, it'd make it a lot easier.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's right.
ba	That's right,
aa	No,
ba	That's right,
sd	You know, pick it up.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
ba	That's true.
fc	Okay,
fc	Bye bye.
qw	And what do you think that problem is?
sv	That seems like you've thought this through quite a bit before.
 ba	That's interesting.
qy	Do youself have children who are or have been through the public school system?
bk	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
no	Well, my mother was on the school board. As we were coming up.
sd	And, that, basically, is the extent to which our family has been directly, you know,
sd	But, that's the extent of which I guess that's more than some people, less than others .
sd	I would, tend to agree with you that there is a problem .
sd	And if there was a way through the public mind, set that image to be a little higher esteem, a little more prestige to being a teacher.
sd	And then if you paid them more, you'd also be able to demand a higher quality product out of them.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
sv	so it's very difficult to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one, other than I guess you kn , how a person scores in the beginning before the class and then after the class.
 sd	also, I've thought about the idea of making teaching and the ,
sv	rather than throw someone into that environment, you know, it
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
sv	I think, especially in the younger years you need to have more of the person contact rather than just the fact that your machine being fed information to learn how to learn.
b	Huh.
bk	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Right.
b	I see.
aa	Definitely is.
b	Right,
fc	Well, I've enjoyed speaking with you.
fc	All righty.
sd	Well, I think basically we're in a lot of agreement, in that I certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs, some kind of legal definition.
sv	But for anything involving that, trial by jury certainly should be mandatory.
 sv	But there should be with our overworked, judicial system,
sv	And maybe instead of, just kind of blowing it off just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do, maybe we should commit to spend a week,
sv	and each case is presented to that group of twenty five,
sd	you know, that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say, your pleasure your honor,
sv	But the way our court system works, that guy is going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time.
sv	I just think our system is overworked,
sv	You know, kind of off what we've been talking about here, I believe that we've become almost a litigious society where everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff,
 sv	You know, maybe, instead of being so quick to sue you, if you have a disagreement with someone, instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff, nee , maybe you,
sv	and let either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case.
sv	And you know, let's get rid of some of this harassment suing.
ba	You bet,
b	Yes,
ba	Well, that may be right.
sv	I think we both know that we're talking about the foundation of our legal society.
sv(^q)	that was sort of the beginning of, Ye shall be treated fairly.
sv(^q)	I guess the Lord started out with, I'll treat you fairly there as long as you do what I say.
sd	I know,
sd	But that's a whole different subject. on the legal system.
fc	But it's been a pleasure talking with you.
sd	I'm living here in Texas.
sd	Well, that's quite all right.
sd	Well, so am I .
sd	In fact, I'm at work out at Lewisville.
fc	My pleasure.
fc	Bye bye.
fp^m	Hi,
b	Yeah.
b	really.
sd	Well, I don't have that , experience to share .
sd	I do, I do listen to a lot of,
sd	however, I do, I do like a lot of different forms of music
sd	there's such a wide selection,
sd	but, if it's not, then I won't.
b^m	Rap.
b	Yeah.
sd	I have strong objections to that.
ny	Yeah,
sd	And, it was about,
sv	And, you listen a lot,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think it's kind of absurd, you know, the fact that, you know, they don't really give, you know, the original artist, or the original composer,
 +	the credit that is really due to them.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Jimi Hendrix was the original.
sd^r	Jimi Hendrix was the original.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean it was just like,
^q	you know, that was really great.
sv	I think a good one was,
sv	and, then the cover version, I mean, I thought, it was pitiful.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
ba	man.
b	Yeah.
sd	I loved,
sd	so I was really familiar with a lot of the A O R type music.
sd(^q)	and you know, I mean, a lot of people they go, they're better than the Beatles,
sv	I mean, the comparison made between New Kids On The Block with the Beatles . It was just,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	I saw some promise, you know, with a lot of the new wave, when it came out, back in the mid and early eighties.
h	And then, I don't know
ny	Yeah,
sv	Well, you know, really that's not world music.
sd	Well, world music is,
sd	for example, let's say you're taking like an original Brazilian form of music with a certain style,
sd	And, then when they hear it, it's a really, it's another form of music, and, you know, sort of, trying to draw out the best sources.
sd	there are some, you know, types of heavy metal that I really like,
sd	you know, and it's the same way with,
ny	Yeah,
 sd	so, you know, well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa now, and from West Africa, that's considered world music, because it's not particularly using certain types of folk styles.
sd	But, they're trying to make it somewhat more modern.
sd	You know, he's a jazz performer,
no	I don't know.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
fp	Hi.
sd	Well the only thing we've taken back recently are plants. Shrubbery, that were guaranteed
sd	and we had no problem with it.
sd	We got our money back.
sd	Well, I believe they're better.
sv	I think so.
b	Right .
qy	did you return it?
b^m	No,
b	Huh,
b	Oh.
aa	No,
b	Uh huh.

ng	I haven't bought any new clo ,
sv	I think it is too,
aa	Yes
aa	That's right,
 +	half of it raveled out.

fc^m	Bye, bye.
qy^d	You do!

b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,

b	Yes.
ba	That's very good.

sd	DEAD ZONE.
sd^r	DEAD ZONE.

b	Right.
ba	That's true,
sd	that was one of my favorite subjects in school was, literature.

b	Yeah,
nn	No
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
ba	that's right.
ba	Sure is neat .
b	Yeah.
sd	I know it's really hard for me.
sd	so it's hard for me to sit down and read,
sd	but when I do I just love it.
sv^t	I think we have, too.
fc	You, too.
qy^g	Well, I suppose I'm supposed to say the Rangers, right .
b	Yeah.
nn	No,
sd	I lived in Chicago.
b	Yeah
qo	What did you think of the World Series?
 b	Uh huh.
qy^g	So you didn't really have a lot of choice, did you.
^2	Or country.
qo	What do you think going to happen to the Rangers?
qrr	Or can we predict?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No.
fe	isn't it though.
sd	Well, I'm a great sports enthusiast,
sd	The Restaurant Hall of Fame inducted him tonight,
sd	he doesn't know how many years I mean, to pitch.
sd	He'll be at least one more,
b	Yeah.
ba	That's right.
ny	Yeah,
sv	But, he certainly is a good example, for the kids.
sv	You know, you like to have someone like that you could point to say, see what a fine man, that, he is.
ba	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	he's been a legend for so many years, you know,
b	Yeah,
na^m	Ryan against Ryan,
sd	and, only, Ryan didn't want too much publicity on it because he didn't want his son getting too nervous about this whole thing.
sv	A game is a game, you know.
sd	but Nolan I think took himself out after a couple of innings or something, you know, of the game
aa	Okay.
na	Right.
nd	Well,
ny	Yes,
sv	And, you know, that's about the only thing.
sv	well, I guess, if it was someone in my family, I'd probably feel that way.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ba	Well, that's true .
^2	Besides him.
^2	His life isn't worth very much then .
b	Right.
b^m	Potential.
sv	Now, are they rehabilitative or not.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I can imagine.
ba	Yes.
qy^d	So it hasn't been a long time ago.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yes,
sd	China painting and ceramics.
sd	I enjoy it.
sd	I enjoy the china more.
sd	And now that I have my eyes, corrected to the point that I can see the delicate part of china painting, I do enjoy it.
sd	My husband kept begging me,
sd	And I said I'll do it for three months
sd	I have sold quite a bit.
sd	I have just retired.
aa	Yes.
nd	No,
ba	Wow.
b	uh huh.
sd	Well, my sister is the seamstress of the two of us.

ba	That's right.
sd	In Abilene, Texas.
sd	She just taught china painting.
sd	then we had so much fun there,
br	Beg pardon?
sd	I have been a little bit negligent about it because I was so tired when I had to go to work after my husband's death.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ny	well yeah .
sv	Like so many people do.
na^m	Right .
b	Right.

b	Right.
b	Yeah.
br^m	You must be what?
nn	No,
sd	I don't work.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
sd	the majority of the actual gang crimes, like the drive by shootings and stuff stays in the neighborhoods,
na	very much so,
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's just so sad, you know,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b@	Uh huh. Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
sd	and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they don't have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And I don't know how you combat that.
b	Uh huh ,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh,
sd	it's very prevalent,
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh,
b	Oh.
b	Right .
ba	That's true .
sd	I have a kind of a fortunate situation, I think, right now with my sixteen year old.
sd	and I work two nights a week at the Senior High School library.
sd	and then they, the school district hires an aide, you know, to work for me.
sd	Well, my son is my aide.
sd	So, two nights a week for four hours we're stuck together
sd	and there's usually not very much business.
sd	I mean, some nights it's just real quiet.
sd	So I have sort of a captive audience,
sd	But, of course I'm away from my other son those hours, too.
b	Yeah,
sv	but it is hard, once they get that age,
ba	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yes,
sv	Well, if you're kind of a person that likes things, you know, organized or neat
sv	then I think it is hard.
sd	we often go to Illinois for Christmas,
sd	and we're not this year,
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	you know, but every now and then, I mean, he's got a lot of those hard kind,
sd	and, we have the train,
aa	yeah,
sd	so he worked on that for the longest time, ever since school was out on Friday,
sd	those kinds of things never happen
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes,
b	Uh huh,
aa	No .
b	Yeah,
sd	they talk about T V shows,
^2	it's the best show on,
b	Uh huh .
b	Right .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
b	Right.
b	Right,
b^r	right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	kind of in lieu of the draft for people who, you know, are conscientious objectors or don't otherwise want e , to be in the military, you know.
sd	And I went to college for four years and got out, you know,
sv	But, you know, for some people that's good.
sv	Well, that's one view .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd@	a friend of mine traveled to Balise and, into Honduras. * spelling Belize?
fp	Hello.
b	Yeah,
fc	Well, I'll talk to you later,
fc	Okay.
sd	I think that would probably, be very possible,
ny	Yes,
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	and then the, corporate, you know, industries just don't seem to not pay proportionally.
sv	I think that that would help a lot.
 sv	And, seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from that direction.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b^m	not going to help.
ba	Amen .
 aa	It seems to be.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, that's quite possible.
sd	She's a,
ny	Yeah.
nn	No,
sd	I don't think I could part with her.
b	Okay.
fc	Okay,
fc	Bye bye .
sv	I think that, really it wouldn't hurt most of the young people of the country to have to go and do voluntary service.
ng	Not right now,
sv	I think probably as soon as they finished high school it would be ideal, because a lot of times, if they go straight into college I think they're going in too quick
b	Right,
sd	Well, a lot of parents fund their children.
b	Right.
na	I think it would.
qy	What, into the service?
 sv	Well I, I, I think that they ought to have something for the unemployed in a voluntary field like the,
bh	He was in that?
sd	or go into the more depressed areas and help repair the houses.
b	Uh huh.
fc	okay,
fc	Bye.
sd	Well, actually I'm a Dodgers fan from way back.
sd	Like, late fifties, early sixties.
br	What's that?
b	Yeah.
bh	Is that right?
ba	That's interesting.
no	I couldn't tell you for sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
ba	Well, that's true.
aa	I don't either.
sd	I mean, he really has become a very decent fielder.
sd	He's not the liability that he used to be.
b	Yeah,
b	yeah.
b	Right.
b	It may be.
b	Right,
br	who's the last one.
bk	okay.
aa	Yes he is.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah.
qy	Are you an Orioles fan?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	three hundred miles.
b	Yeah,
ba	There you go.
qy^g	Boy, you are a baseball fan, aren't you.
ba	Interesting.
ba	Wow.
ba	All right.
b	Sure.
fc	I wouldn't mind it.
fc	Yeah,
fc	Bye bye.
sv	Well, I think they're a necessary evil.
sd	it just depends.
sv	So , I think for, for many years, we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are, to a great extent, public servants we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society.
sv	But, then again, it's hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of, government, including municipalities as well as state and federal governments.
ba	you're very fortunate.
sd	We just try not to pay any more in than we have to,
sd	We don't regret paying taxes.
sv	And progressive tax, I think, does not give people incentive to make more money,
sv	It should be, I think, a flat percentage
sd	last year when they passed the tax laws for the, nineteen ninety, ninety one, whatever, nineteen ninety one I added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else,
sd	and I totaled them all up
sv	Now, that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every item on there even though there's, taxes on different things.
sv	But, you know, there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying,
sd	You pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your tank.
sv	But you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes.
b	Yeah ,
sv(^q)	And, so, if they penalize businesses, business people are smart enough to say, here's my break point, I'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs.
sd	Based on that, who do you think you're talking to,
b^m	The news,
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	I read a lot,
ng	well, I'm not getting an ,
sd	but, you know, as I said, I do,
no	I don't know .
sd	And I don't know, you know, what's, I mean, what are we supposed to, compare it to you know, I mean, the quality,
sv	whatever they tell you,
bh	really?
b	Oh.
sd	But most of the times I find that even if you know, they do have like tremors out there, you know, there'll be a small article in the paper about it.
sv	well. That's what sells papers.
 sv	that's been like that since the first newspaper, you know .
h	You know, but, I don't know.
bh	I mean, what basis, you know, of comparison do we have really?
b	yeah,
sv	It's all so negative, you know.
b	Oh.
bh	is it really?
ny	Well, yeah,
h	I don't know,
sd^t	was it last week, we were supposed to talk about gardening
sd^t	and it was really funny,
b	Yeah,
sd^t	and then we just talked about, you know, whatever, I mean.
sv^t	there really isn't much to say after you know, you know, you, you tell the person you know, where their, where they find their sources of information from
sv^t	and then, you know, if they're satisfied,
sv^t	It's hard to talk for five minutes on this .
sd	Well, none at the moment .
o	No,
sd	And I would imagine that if I change or if I get a new car, I will go with the Taurus or something similar, in that regard.
na	Absolutely.
sd	and it's everything it's supposed to be.
sd	and, the only thing I have against it in that's it's a Taurus,
sd	and so it's a little bit larger.
sd	But that's the only difference that I see, really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, my wife still has a Honda Accord,
sd	and it's an excellent automobile. but, you know, price and so forth,
sd	I'm not a real car fan.
sd	I want something that's serviceable, something that I can use
sd	and with the Taurus,
sd	And as I said, as far I'm concerned, it has been extremely, serviceable and everything I wanted.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've driven, you know, Chevrolet automobiles and Dodge,
sd	And, I was ready to get rid of it two months after I bought it,
sd	so I shopped around,
sd	I have a friend who, has an auto shop,
 sd	And it was upon his recommendation and so forth for, you know, comparably equipped, you know, with cruise control and air conditioning and A M F M radio, and all these other things
sd	there was no comparison.
sd	that's about the only thing I find, you know, disadvantageous to it.
sd	But those are my criteria,
b	Uh huh.
 %	I,
 sd	I can't remember what the name is.
sd	but to pay that much money for an automobile, is just,
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's true. Well,
sd	The difference there too, is between us is that I am not really crazy about driving.
 sd	I never have been, since, you know, my parents had to force me to get my driver's license when I was young when I was sixteen.
sd	So I've never really cared.
sd	it was always someone else's.
sd^t	we don't, we won't get the recorder or the, system to shut us off, tonight.
sd^t	Well, it's very easy when you get on a topic that, you know, you enjoy.
 b	yeah.
sd^t	Well I was talking to a lady last evening,
 b	Okay.
fc	Good bye.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
qw	where do you usually go?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	it's gorgeous.
 sd	so they are very large condos.
sd	go down.
ny	Yes,
sd	enough to make it.
sd	there's not as many sea shells along there,
sd	if you go further down, you will usually find some, but not right in there.
sd	It's a place called Jetty East, J E T T Y E A S T,
sd	and, it's at the very end,
sd	and, I think it's going to cost us, per couple, about three hundred dollars for the week.
aa	Yeah,
 +	kitchen and everything.
sd	We have got a beautiful view and balcony,
sd	But, it's a pretty nice place,
sd	It's a little far from here,
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
qw	what does that mean, alternate?
b	Oh.
bk	I see.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
 b	Right.
aa	Okay.
fc	So long.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	well, the last movie I saw, but it wasn't my choice, was the NINJA TURTLE movie .
na	That's right.
sv	That's an excellent movie.
sv	was that good.
b	okay.
ba	Well, that's good.
b	Yeah.
sd	SILENCE OF THE LAMBS kept me on the edge of my seat.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
b	Really.
sd	I mean, I like all ranges of movies,
sd	I really enjoy,
b	Oh.
b	Yes,
b	Oh .
b^m	Amarillo.
b	So, yeah.
b	Right,
qh	You know what I mean.
b	Right.
sv	It's pretty good.
sd	So, if and when we ever get a baby sitter, like we did with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, we go see it.
aa	no,
ny	Yeah,
t1	gosh what was the last comedy we saw?
b	Uh huh.
ba	But that sounds good.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	okay.
 ba	That's neat.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Yeah,
sd	Probably the last comedy we saw, now that I think about it, is HOME ALONE.
sv	It was really cute.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Maybe so,
aa	Yeah,
sd	I do too.
sv	you have to see those twice to catch everything.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	I do too.
sd	So I'm looking forward to seeing that because that looks hilarious, as they all do.
sd	Well, , we try to go a couple times a month, I guess to see a movie.
sd	it's just getting so expensive.
 sd	But normally we don't think about it until,
sd	I know, because we can go spend fifteen dollars just getting in the three of us.
b	Yeah.
sd	So they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and coke.
b	Yeah.
ba	I guess so.
sd	I haven't seen,
b^m	No,
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
bk	okay.
sd	See, that is honest to God the one reason I don't want to see the movie is because I love buffalos for some weird reason,
sd	and I know they're fake.
b	Okay,
ba	that'll be good.
b	Yeah,
sd	They did a lot of stuff that they cut out.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	so they're going to put it in the video.
sd	And that way you can watch it at your leisure.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
ba	True.
ba	I know it .
b	Yeah,
b	Right.
sd	I have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that I think they put off so much
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No.
bh	Really?
 b	Oh.
b	Right.
sd	I wouldn't have thought that Pillsbury would, the, I mean, or even had chem , you know, well,
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
b	Right,
 +	In packaging
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	only thing I can think is bleaching
sd	But, we're on the southwest side of Houston
sd	We've got Imperial sugar
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
 b	Uh huh.
sd	and I think, well, what if somebody's dumped something back there in the, and no one knows about it and, you know, it sinked in through the ground and all that,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	okay,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ba	It will.
b	Uh huh,
b	Right.
sd	These are well fed .
 b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
ba	now that's bad.
sd	, I was going to say, the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of cow manure was going to be bad.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	yes,
sd	and trees help so that,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	So, yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b^m	Both,
qy	Are you at work right now?
sd	So am I.
sd	I'm, I'm Spring Creek.
sd	I'm building, one.
aa	Not like that.
b	Right.
qo	So how's the weather in building two?
nn	No,
sd	From California.
sd	Not as nice as California .
sd	five years now.
sd	I've been here long pretty long.
ny	Yes,
b	Right,
b	Yeah,
sd	Well, that's even farther away.
bf	Even in the Summer time,
b	Uh huh,
^2	Green.
b	Right.
aa	No,
 b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	March we typically get a lot of rain,
sd	it's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like.
sv	Well, it's just that, you know,
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
sd	you pick them up, you know,
b	Right,
no	I don't know how hail is formed to tell you the truth.
sv	You don't think it's cold enough, you know to,
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
 b	Right.
sd	The creek overflows
sd	the streets and stuff around that area, get a lot of flooding.
b	Okay.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see.
 b	I see.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh,
b	Is that right.
b	Yeah,
sd	That really is a nice area.
b	Right,
b	Right,
sd	Southern California.
na	I've lived in San Diego for six years when I was younger, and L A area,
b	Yeah.
b	Huh.
^2	Out there,
b	Yeah,
b	Okay,
sd	I know where Valley is,
ng	I didn't notice anything strange, I guess about it.
sd	Maybe Texas the way,
b	Uh huh.
sd	And they've built some new highways out to that area, and things, lately.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	Yeah
na	we have one.
b	Right.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, my degree was in fourth through seventh grade
sd	but, anyway, at the time that's what I taught.
sd	but it wasn't too bad.
b	Yeah.
sd	But I had decided long before I was even married that I wanted to, if possible, teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools.
sd	and my reason for that was I don't like what's the right word. The varied inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools.
sv	You can find a lot of good public schools if you look real hard
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah .
sd	And the, the crime is just escalated and the drugs and, even in the, the lower, the lower schools.
b	Uh huh .
b	Right.
sv	Crazy for him to
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, we had the problem when I was in,
sd	And you don't know if you were reaching them or not
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sv	I think there's a problem too with teachers trying to be so versatile that they do loose sight of the basics, you know,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I spent a year and a half in Japan also
sd	And then at the end of a certain time period you spitted everything back out
sd	So I don't completely agree with that either.
sd	But there, there definitely needs to be a balance somewhere.
bh	is it?
qy	Is that what you ended up going into?
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	how much can you stuff in your brain.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	good question .
aa	No.
sv	I think it's like a lot of things in the United States.
sv	and in the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again
sv	Not without wiping out a whole generation of kids in the school system,
sd	Maybe on smaller scales.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	you know, they're kind of fearful of, everything.
sd	well, at least I've heard that
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
sd	they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum, although you don't have to.
sd	And then if you have particular religious beliefs they're kind of monitored.
sd	I don't think they're were in this area
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Really?
sd	I'm pretty much for it.
sv	We'll have some interesting discussion, I guess.
^2	Wrongfully.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
h	Well, you know, I, I guess I can see it from several different perspectives,
sv	But, you know, and, you know, he's never going to be, to me, a functioning part of society.
h	I mean, I don't know,
b	really.
b	Right.
b@	Yeah. Well I can underst
 +@	you know. Right.
 b	Right.
b	Right,
sv	You know, everybody would be just as scared to death, you know.
sv	I mean, you know, they're not even having to serve out what they should be serving.
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
sd@	I really would have a hard time, especially if I was on a jury, not wanting him to, you know, be executed. Yeah.
 sv	Because, I mean, that's just awful.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Really.
b	Yeah.

b	Uh huh.
ba	I bet.
b	Uh huh.

sd	Stripper, well he started out being a little orphan,
sd	well he's outside
sd	he's got free access of a window we like to keep open.
sd	So, he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to.
sd	Joey, on the other hand is a little different.
na	definitely.
b	Uh huh.

bh	Really?
sv	It's hard to find people like that.
b	Uh huh.
 b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh.
b	Yeah.
qw	What kind of questions did you ask about the private sitter before you took her over there?
ba	good ,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	did you introduce your daughter to her before you made, your decision?
 bh	Really?
b	Yeah.
qw	So, what made you decide to put her in a Montessori school?
b@	Uh huh. Yeah.

b	Uh huh.
sv	Nothing wrong with that .

b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes.
na@	Yeah. We'd like to. * should be two slash units
b	Yeah.
b	really.
qy^d	You don't believe in it?
b	Yeah.
sd	You sound a lot like a friend of mine. A a girl I hang out with.
sd	She has very black and white opinions, you know.
sd	but I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to punish, especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done.
sv	And we see that more and more.
sd	you know, that's fourteen years old.
b	Yeah.
aa	No
b	And, yeah,
sd	But even in Georgia that's the attitude for the most part.
^q	But when I've got to work to pay my dues and your dues then I don't like you very much anymore.
b	really.
b	Yeah.
ba	You might be right.
sv	but I do believe it's necessary
sd	On the one hand I guess I admire the person who has the guts to do it because I couldn't I couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing
sd	and I couldn't pull the switch
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
 qw	What what's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing ?
 b	Yeah.
ba	gosh .
qw	So, what are your favorite shows?
bh	really?
qy^d	QUANTUM LEAP?
qy	Did you see it the other night?
sv	that was pretty good.

qy^d	You've never seen NORTHERN EXPOSURE?
sv	it's a great show.
bh	Really?
qy^d	you haven't seen any of them.
sv	well, they're good,
bk	okay.
sd	Well, they're a lot different.
 sd	And I guess the newer ones are real futuristic, too,
bh	Really?
aa	No.
sv	but that's true,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, it seems like they always show COLOMBO, the same ones over and over, though you know what I'm saying, like that one where he goes to college,
qrr	or is there a series on.
b	Okay.
ny	Yeah,
sd	See, that was a rerun.
b	Yeah,
sd	He was a movie director,
b	Okay.
sv	That was pretty good though .
b	Uh huh.
ba	No kidding.
sd	there's something I watch on Saturdays,
qy^d	You never saw that?
b	Yeah,
sd	But, it was a different type of show.
sd	I didn't like the way it ended, though.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	But it's all over now.
sd	just a couple.
sd	I've got an Omega
ny	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sd	That's all I got to say for it.
br	Huh?
sd	work,
sd	anything .
sd	I've done business programming, you know, scientific applications like, you know, petroleum science stuff and, test equipment
sd	and I, I did one that was, the demonstration of a touch screen for a company that sells, touch screens.
sd	Put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display. And make it look like things like, you know, attack simulators , and all sorts of little things you'd want to put your finger on the screen for.
aa	yeah,
b	yeah,
br	Huh?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	his name is T Q or something like that.
br	Huh?
b	Uh huh.

ny	Uh huh.
qy	do you know where, Custer is?
bk	Okay,
ny	Uh huh.
na	Right,
sd	It's a little place, looks like a castle.
sd	Kind of, little guy in there.
sd	Like I traded my, three eighty six for the four eighty six for about six hundred.
aa	Yeah,
sd	and he does a good job
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
sd	they're up there in that mall. just below Campbell. Or that strip, center.
 sd	They're still doing business. Big business, apparently.
b	Uh huh,
ba	That works,
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
o	All right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
 sd	I've been camping for years, not on a regular basis
sd	and, then I moved to North Carolina
 sd	And then maybe camp another night and drive home.
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, it's, in terms of north, south I would say it's, a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it.
no	Well, it, it's,
sd	the Blue Ridge in North Carolina I think are much nicer
sd	The way it works.
sd	I think there's quite a few.
sd	It's, it's actually kind of incredible,
 sd	and, it's just kind of nice.
sd	So, it's pretty nice.
sd	Of course, they drag a lot of drugs with them
na	They can be,
sd	I've been camping in Death Valley,
sd	But it's beautiful in February.
sd	I mean, it's just beautiful.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah,
 aa	Yeah,
fc	Okay,
nn	No,
sd	And it's just an old compact, that is super slow
no	I don't know,
sd	I do, television ratings
sd	It's basically just data entry and running, you know, some software
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah,
sd	something with the defense.
ny	Yeah,
sd	He works up in Plano.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd	I learned so many things that they do,
sd	but then he switched jobs.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	Software design engineer, as they call it,
sd	it's basically the, more the business end of it than the programming end of it, you know.
sd	but I've been at it for, you know, five years,
nn	No,
sd	but, it quit working
b	uh huh.
ba	how nice,
sd	He doesn't have one of those.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	boy.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah. {D You know,
ba	That's right .
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
sd	I did a lot of his papers.
qy^d	At home?
sd	the packages I don't really use,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
nn	Well, no,
sd	and they just wanted me to continue working for them at home doing other things,
aa	Yeah,
sd	and it's time consuming.
na	That's right, you know,
sd	you know, it's not something that's continual because, you know, the television ratings don't come out, you know, all the time.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
sd	they just send me everything and pick it up courier or whatever,
b	Yeah.
sd	But I, you know, worked,
sd	A lot of them just know me by name and phone voice.
b	Yeah,
fc	Okay, well, thanks,
b	Okay.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's funny that those are my husband's two favorite shows, too,
sd	and the only reason I think I like it now is because I've seen it so much
sd	And I told my husband, that's the whole point,
sd	I find him degrading at times.
b	Oh.
sv	I think it probably adds a little bit of depth to his character.
aa	yeah,
sv	but he's doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do
sv	I like that.
sd	I think my favorite show is HUNTER.
sd	And, I like the old series better when, Dede was in there.
aa	Yeah
sd	so, and then the blond that they took out, the one that got killed
b	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	The second lady?
b	Uh huh.
aa	They didn't.
b	Yeah,
sd	and I think that's what I didn't like.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	And I like the new lady better,
b	Yeah,
sv	and now they're starting to go back to it,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
^2	Just go ahead and quit the wondering
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I didn't, I was going to say, I didn't ever watch MOONLIGHTING,
sd	but I heard that's what killed it
sv	that, interplay died when they got married,
 b	Uh huh.
 ^2	Halfway through,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I'm guess it's falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows
b	yeah,
sd	I've seen it before,
sd	Usually Tuesday nights I'm out,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	and I think it's the same with your characters on T V.
na	Probably,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh
sv	it would have been hard,
sd	I just, the publicity in and of itself, much less the, I mean,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
sd^t	You're the first man I've talked to,
sv^t	You've had a little bit of variety,
b	Okay ,
fc	Bye bye.
ba	Wow,
b	Uh huh.
b	really,
bd	That's okay,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
qrr	Or down here in Denison,
b	Okay,
sd	I was going to say you didn't have the typical,
sd	but you don't have a Texas accent.
sd	Well I'm originally from, Ohio, Cincinnati,
sd	so I'm familiar with,
aa	Right,
sd	Anyway, my home I guess it's about twenty five hundred square foot
sd	We have two,
ny	Yeah,
sd	And so, we're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it. And then shuffle the rooms around a little bit.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right,
sd	You know we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for,
b	Uh huh,
aa	No,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I figured I'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean.
aa	Right,
sd	So it's not a new home,
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ba	that is awful.
b	Uh huh,
^2	The normal tiles,
b	Uh huh.
sd	and also they're very heavy
ba	wow,
sd	I mean we need to redo some, rewiring ourselves
sd	and, it can be really bizarre.
sd	And we never know where it's going to flood.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
ba	boy, you do have a strange wiring problem there.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well that's something,
br	Pardon.
ba	That's right.
sd	Well that's the way mine is, you know,
sd	I mean, he well he said he went up in the attic and looked around
sd	It was a wood shingle roof,
aa	He probably knows,
aa	Yeah,
sd	Unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail and rain.
sd	and we had, we had almost, I'd say about half of the roof off,
sd	And a house full of snow, and rain,
sd	and it came down,
sd	and the wind came in from the north
sd	I had water coming in every light fixture.
sd	I had water coming in everything that was in the ceiling, everywhere.
sd	And I would go in,
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ba	yeah,
ba	my lord.
^2	But it's quite a bit, quite a bit,
no	several of our rooms got ruined,
sd	so it got into the carpeting, got into the floor.
b	really.
b	Yeah,
sd	I mean we'd done everything we could to keep out the weather. You know, and stuff
ba	yeah
qy^d	the roof?
ny	yeah,
 sd	see, it's three,
qy^d	What, the walk?
ny	yeah,
sd	I mean this is what,
qy^c	Are you there?
bk	Okay .
b	Okay.
ny	Yes,
qo	How about you?
ba	my goodness .
ny	Yeah,
sd^r	I do,
sd	so he's not quite two and a half yet.
sd	I put him,
sd	I put him in a day care center from the very beginning.
h	I don't know,
sd	I have had this real problem with a private individual.
sd	and I always figured at least in a day care center there are other people around,
sd	and if you get one bad apple, there's are at least other people that can see it.
sd	They can watch,
qy^d	You know, how can you help depending on the day care center, you know,
sv	you got to when you hear about all the horrible things that happen in day care centers,
aa	Yeah,
sd	So, that's what I did
sd	I have been just so happy.
b	Right.
sd	and, it was wonderful,
sd	But, I thought okay, I'm going to keep an open mind here,
 sd	and the people who came in, it just wasn't, it, just wasn't the same
sd	and their, their attitude and philosophy was just completely, opposite from mine,
sd	and I left him there for about a month and just decided I can't do this anymore,
sd	but. but, he's done well,
sd	he's been there, a couple of months now,
sd	and I just feel so lucky.
b	Yeah.
qo	How about you?
ba	Wonderful.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^2	A baby.
b	Yeah .
sd	I know how that goes .
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
^2	To find the right one,
sd	that's what we have to do though.
aa	No.
qw	where do you live?
qy^d	Plano?
b^m	Care provider.
ba	that's wonderful.
ba	That's great.
b	Right,
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
bf	Poor kid was in school all day.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	we all need that time, just some quiet time to wind down from the day.
b	Yeah,
sd	and we've already started about,
 sd	you know, we both think of that as just so important,
 +	to get him involved in stuff like that
sd	I mean, he's so much fun now,
sd	he's really starting to get lots of fun
sd	you know, and, you know, we did the Easter egg hunts, which was really the first year he was really able to
sd	and to know what he was doing you know, and enjoy it,
sd	and it was so much fun
sd	and Lord, I couldn't believe it.
 sd	They had so much fun. .
sd	I bought us tickets and stood there in line
sd	Day care has just done just incredible stuff with him
sd	and he's excited to get there in the morning, and just doesn't even want to kiss me good bye.
sd(^q)	It's just like bye,
sd	and he's always having fun when I pick him up
sd	it's Bright Steps in Lewisville.
sd(^q)	whenever you say Bright Steps, everybody goes, I've heard that's the best day care in town, you know,
sd	and it's one of those that's very hard to get into.
 sd	and this, this, this woman owns three day cares, two in Lewisville and one in Irving.
sd	and she had to open the second one up in Lewisville because, her waiting list was just like, you know, like a year old,
sd	it was ridiculous.
sd	And, she's got two day cares within like three blocks of each other.
b	Yes,
sd	She knows what she's doing,
sv	it makes a huge difference.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's right.
sd	and the owner, I really liked her
sd	and I got lucky
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
no	it just went up the first of this month.
sd	It's a little high,
sd	but you know, it's like where he was before I was only paying sixty three,
sd	but, I looked all over Lewisville,
sd	and, you know, and there were places that were cheaper,
sv	you know, your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money, you know,
sd	and I have peace of mind, where he is
sd	and some of those other places I wouldn't have.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd^t	Well, I could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as what was the topic.
fe	God .
co	Well, let me ask a personal question,
sv	well then you should
sv	you're lucky then
sd	I mean even since I was like about two or three.
sd	Then they diagnosed it,
sd	I used to do it about six times a week
sd	And the shock on the system is just too much,
sd	but, you know, it's hard to find.
sd	or it's the geriatric crowd.
sd	So, I've considered even becoming licensed to teach it.
aa	Yeah,
sd	So, to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without, you know, drawing a lot of looks, means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity
nn	No,
sd	I have been told that thing is just lovely.
b	Huh.
b	Huh.
sd	I don't work at T I.
nn	No,
sd	as matter of fact I was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position
sd	and, me and the insurance adjusters are very familiar with each other
sd	and, I get my attitude expressed through them,
sd	and never having lived in Texas before I starting working for T I
sd	and boy I was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don't say that, you know,
sd	We're talking nineteen seventy eight.
sd	They couldn't have gotten anymore in the dark ages .
sd	I understand that they're now covering women's preventative health care,
sd	and, the reason I'm at home is when I had my kids, and I was scheduled to go back I tell you how much in the dark ages it was. I had been rated number one in the field
sd	and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when I took her home,
aa	Sure.
sd	and then I had a second one eighteen months later,
sd	and I don't even know it.
aa	yeah,
sd	but after the second baby was born I was going to go back to work,
sd	and that was when they had,
sd	and I'll tell you how they handled this
sd(^q)	And they told me well, you know, you know, your husband works here
sd	and I couldn't get my, termination benefits either.
sd	I was just pissed as hell that they could do that.
sd	But I guess things have gotten better,
sv	I still don't think that, after my experiences that they could, you know, get me to go back, ever again .
co	But let me ask you this, since you use Texans,
qy^d	Now that's for individual.
qy^d	That's it?
qy	Now if you pay your monthly charge, do you then pay separately for classes your taking?
ba	God, that's cheap.
sd	That's really cheap.
sd	God, I am so dependent these days.
sd	seen that my co dependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbors fence.
b	Yeah .
sd	I mean, that beats any offer I've heard in a long time.
b	Huh.
sd	See I'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty .
sd	I'm actually right on the Plano line.
b	Yeah.
ba	God it sounds like I would.
ad	You can go back to work now.
fc	Thank you.
fc	Bye bye.
qy	Did you watch DANCES WITH WOLVES,
qy	Did you like it?
sv	I thought it was very well done.
qo	How about GHOST?
b	Right,
aa	No,
qy	you watch many?
qy^d	Do you like the classics like, GONE WITH THE WIND and, you know the older movies.
b	Yeah,
sd	I think I've seen most of Humphrey Bogart's movies, but, in, you know a long time ago,
sd	and, like the MALTESE FALCON and all those,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	I didn't see that one.
b	Really.
b	Yeah.
b	Really,
bk	Okay,
b	Yeah,
sd	I saw that one,
ng	Well I didn't think so,
qo	How about SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?
ba	I know,
b	Yeah.
sd	That's us too,
b	really.
nn	No.
b	Really.
sd	I thought it was kind of maybe for kids more, than ad ,
b	Uh huh.
na	part of it,
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	When you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies, you know.
sd	You see it for, you know a couple of hours or an hour
qw	Whose your favorite actress or actor?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	FIELD OF DREAMS.
aa	yeah,
b^m	SILVERADO,
sd	the title sounds familiar,
b	really.
sd	I might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar although I would remember, I think in, with him in it.
qo	How about REVENGE,
sd	With, Anthony Quinn.
sv	You know, it's, one of those movies that it's not a great movie
b	Yeah
ny	Yeah,
sd	Now that's another one I wanted to see.
qy^d	Cable?
bk	Okay,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I don't know him.
nn	No,
ny	Yes.
b	Okay,
b	Yeah,
sd	I know who you mean.
qy^g	He was in, HONEY DON'T SHRINK THE KIDS, wasn't he?
bk	okay,
 +	an escape type of thing.
qo	How about some of the ads,
b	Yeah.
sv	that was pretty good.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I was just going to say, you should see those, first if you can.
sv	if you read the book it's, even better.
b	Yeah.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
qy@	How about Tom Cruise, do you like his stuff? COCKTAILS,
aa	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	especially if there's commercial in it .
qy^d	Is that the one set in the fifties, or sixties.
b^m	Late fifties,
qo	How about Meryl Streep,
b	Uh huh.
ba	that sounds good.
 sd	It's good.
sd	And, then, tossed salad and,
sd	Corn,
sd	I have a recipe that's pretty good for that .
b	Yeah.
sd	I've heard that Sam's has a really good lasagna
sd	It was good.
^2	Easy .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	I know.
b	yeah.
sv	Not my favorite place, but. A necessity .
^h	Let's see,
sd	You take a flour tortilla
sd	for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some, tomato sauce in it,
^h	And, then, let's see,
 sd	and you can put, like guacamole and
ny	yeah.
aa	No,
sd	I just cut slices off
 +	I like an avocado sandwich, too.
b	Yeah,
qw	where do they get it? .
sv	I can't imagine it would stay fresh long enough to,
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
sd	That's supposed to help keep it from turning brown so quick.
b	Oh.
sv	That probably helps, too.
t3	Do you want it?
t3	Do you want scrambled?
b	Yeah.
sv	if you get it on sale,
b	Yeah,
sd	Poultry instead of the beef and pork,
aa	Yeah,
sd	One salad that we always like, my sister in law always brings to family dinners, is a,
sv	that's good and quick and easy,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	you know, it is a problem.
sd	And then as they got older, they went to, I preferred to call them schools
sd	But we really truly did pay a fortune.
sd	I'm a physician. as is my husband.
sd	and I felt, very good about working.
sd	but I think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children
sv	I think it's real important that you have a place that, first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in.
sd	and they had a wonderful, program that started at age three
sd	most of the teachers had degrees.
b	Yeah.
aa	It was incredible actually .
 +	and, and really feel they have to put their children,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	you know, the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since .
b	Uh huh.
na	Something like that.
sd	Well, you know, but you made the comment earlier, why would someone be interested in children.
 sd	As you start putting lots of little kids together, the infection rates that go around .
sd	So I went ahead, and accepted every one that I was offered. Because I knew it would be easier to go ahead and get them and establish credit early.
sd	So, I pack around a lot of them,
b	Yeah.
sd	And they give you such high credit limits.
sd	it's easy to get caught up in the minimum payment trap.
b	Yeah.
sd	And then all of the others I just try to use kind of like you would an American Express card and pay it off every month.
sd	And that way I feel like I'm getting, you know, a thirty day loan.
sd	But I don't have to worry about, you know, running them up too high, except at Christmas.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I've never used my Visa for cash before.
qy^d	Can you use it like at a bank machine
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Now we got,
sd	Now a couple of weeks later we got pin numbers,
sd	And we cut them up and sent them back because we hadn't even applied for them,
sd	So I thought, man, I don't know if I trust this or not .
sd(^q)	It's like, let's see if we can get her to run up her bills .
sd	Just I feel like even that little bit helps.
ba	I know it.
sd	Well, I work for T I too.
sd	And I think they're getting ready to probably sell us out, our division.
sd	In Johnson City, Tennessee.
b	Yeah.
sv	So, I mean, it's kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards.
b	Uh huh.
b	Man!
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
^2	Didn't pay them.
ba	Man.
ba	I didn't realize that.
b	Yeah.
b	okay.
qy^g	they don't recognize any time difference, do they?
ba	Ooh,
ba	that's scary.
sd	That's something I never thought about getting, you know, checking with to see what your credit report looked like.
ba	Might be worth it for peace of mind.
b	Yeah.
sd	I think that Discover Card has a good idea with, you know, giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you purchase. As long as you don't go crazy trying to get cash back.
sd	And since they don't have the yearly fee.
no	I don't know.
sd	I felt like with Visa and Mastercard and American Express you didn't need another one.
sd	I would think it wouldn't be, you know, much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent everyone else charges.
sv	So that wouldn't be too bad.
b	Yeah.
ba	Holy cow!
ba	Definitely.
ba	That's awful.
sd	I mean there's no point in giving them any more money than we have to.
ba	that's great.
cc	I'll try to remember that one.
sd	I had ordered a sofa and had filled out the paperwork,
sd	And I changed my mind,
sd	but then they went ahead and charged it on my account.
sd	And it took me about eighteen months to get all of that mess off of my account.
qo	How are you?
sv	That sounds kind of like me.
sd	About the same thing.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I'm even in worse shape because I have eight children
sd	A couple of times we've tried some things
sd	The best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope
sd	and when the envelope was empty , then you didn't have any more money to spend in that area.
sd	And that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent.
sd	It was just that when that was empty, you knew you were out of money.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I even find now like with the automatic tellers, I'll go take money out of that
sd	and then I forget to take that out of my checking account.
sd	So I, I leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there.
sd	And I figure that gives me room for the mistakes I make.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Not very often .
aa	That's right.
ny	Well, yeah,
sd	and we have, three teenage daughters
sd	We've actually gone, just recently, to you know having two checking accounts.
sd	And now we are having two.
sd	So, I have to be.
aa	Yes.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bf	So your wife,
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
bf	It's just taking it out, right.
b^m	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	you have something to take it out.
sd	and they've always had, where they match your funds, you know,
sd	you know, we've done that too.
sd	and he has now for about, oh gosh, how long has it been, ten years I guess.
sd	and I get paid very little
sd	and then I use that for food, household expenses,
sd	but the expenses that we need and have around the house.
aa	Yeah.
sd	you know. I am given so much money a month,
sd	So, I try not to, you know,
sv	Because I think when you go to the grocery store, you can go crazy with all the choices that you have
sv	and, you can really waste a lot of money that way.
qw	So, well how long have you been married?
b^m	yeah.
b	yeah.
^2	She hasn't effected your budget yet really.
aa	No.
sv	You will see that all of a sudden you're trying to decide whether you are going to do, you know, soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do
sv(^q)	and then you really have to start saying okay, now what can we afford you know,
^q	what can we do here
sv	and then as the girls got older, I think we did more and more of that.
qw	but what do you do?
bk	okay.
b	Oh.
sd	But, budgeting.
sd	and it would be very hard for me because I wouldn't have any idea how much money I was spending in one month.
sd	Now, I know exactly what I'm spending
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
qy	Is he able to, still do everything himself pretty well?
bk	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
^q	and I'm just here for the rest of the stay .
sd	they can look after a lot of things
sv	And that's difficult part.
sd	I know, like here in Saskatchewan, we have our hospital care the care actually for the older people graded in four levels.
sv	but I think that it can be helpful in that, it gets people the level of physical care they need.
aa	Yeah.
sd	And, if you're not able to look after yourself, then you have to rely,
^h	Well, that's a really hard question.
b	Right.
aa	Yes,
b	Well, yeah,
sd	I'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing some who has already gotten polio.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
sd	and the poor President has to, either accept or reject the whole thing.
b	Oh.
sv	And whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment, there's always going to be a dispute as to, where the boundary between waste and necessity is.
sd	So I'm not sure that that will help solve our problems,
b^m	Pork barrel politics.
sv	at least at the end.
b	Yeah,
^2	And spare the economy.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well it's kind of difficult for me. Because right now, like most teachers, I'm laid off
sd	so, I spend most, you know,
sv	So it's very hard on a nonfixed income because I don't know how many days I'm going to be called in and whether I am or not, to try to keep track of finances.
sd	but I know how much I have to bring in a month .
nn	no.
sd	So, right now, we get you know, aid from the state at this point because there's no other way to do it.
sd	So right now I know what I'm getting from the state
sd	But I still have to figure out.
sd	Like this week I've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in
sd	So, you know, the four days before, they only have a four day week
sd	and they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in .
sv	They don't like to be absent before a vacation.
sd	But well I'm shopping around as far as trying that's why I'm doing this, to get some extra money. And, getting pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts.
sd	My kids are in Boy Scouts
ba	my Lord.
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh .
aa	Sure.
b	Right.
ny	yes
sd	you know, I keep track of every penny. And, more or less, enter it in.
sd	Every single day I'm at the computer.
sd(^q)	And, it's like, okay, what do we have left, what do we have to pay, what have we paid this month. What hasn't come in yet, you know .
sd	Universal health insurance,
o@	* all 3 utts should be separate slash units Well, I think universal health insurance, like national health, like what Canada has, Is that what you're thinking the subject is about?
qy	Did you read, the article in the paper today about this particular subject?
ny	Yeah.
sd	the state of Washington and the state of Minnesota is, going to begin testing a state funded program for citizens of those two states
sv	Extremely expensive, though.
b	Uh huh.
o	Well, that's the thing, you know,
b	Yeah.
ny	Yes,
sd^m	through my company,
sd	And it was a go to Parkland type situation.
sv	because it was a life threatening situation, it was very good.
aa	No,
ar	I had a bad experience as it turned out.
nn^e	no she passed away.
bd	That's all right.
bd	That happens.
b	Yeah,
bh	is that right?
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, when I grew up and
b	Uh huh.
sd	Did not know that.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
sd	So I kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken, at least for now.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
qo	Well, how to you handle that, the long range or medium range planning on finances?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well our situation is just kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently, took on a full time job, well almost full time.
sd	Stockton.
qo	How about you?
b	Uh huh.
sd	a colleague of mine at, work got some information over, the computer network called INTERNET.
sd	And he just forwarded that on to me
sd	so I sent back mail.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qo	Well what other long range goals do you have besides college?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, one of the things that I found to be, an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the, credit card bill.
sd	and, in fact, it is actually prohibited
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	I agree with you there.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
bf	How do you know that?
b	Uh huh.
sd	Last year, the, Lotus Development Company, the, company that puts out One, Two, Three was planning on marketing a, C D Rom with people's names sorted by number of different criteria.
aa	Definitely.
b	Uh huh.
na	I have twice.
sv	It was a pretty wild experience.
sd	They were just, you know, small time cases where, trailers and banks were involved, you know.
sd	They were civil.
sd	the jury, let me see, I think it was ten to one on the jury, because they only had to have eleven people
sd	and, the one changed his vote at the end.
sd	So it became unanimous, you know, after they turned it in
sd	and then he changed his mind after they turned it in
aa	Right.
sd	the other case was just traffic,
sd	and it didn't even hardly go through,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	I wouldn't think that it does I mean, from my, from what I experienced in them,
ny	Yeah,
sd	I'm not used to it not being organized,
aa	That's about what it was.
ny	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
b	Yes.
sv	I don't think that they, they educate them enough to really know what's going on.
b	Yeah,
sd	It was on his property.
aa	Right.
sd	And then when they came to get it, well, it was on the landlord's property
sd	and it was a double wide,
sd	and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd	Well, I have, a nine year old and a six year old
sd	but, they both went through preschool.
sv	And, we've just been real lucky I think, anyway. To not,
aa	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ba	my gosh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
sv	your lucky to have an art teacher
bh	is that right?
ba	my goodness.
ba	my goodness.
aa	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	That's hard.
sv	It's so difficult for them.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	gosh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	it's some kind of advisory board they've put together for parents and children
sd	and they've now moved it to Washington, D C
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well and I would think, you know, since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions they do you know, the people that work in big business have families
sd	they have children.
sv	So, it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working
b	Uh huh.
ba	good.
ba	That's good to know.
sv	usually, you know, you'll find a woman that's keeping like six children or four to six children in the home
sd	and my future sister in law's mother does that too, full time.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
bf	Too transit.
^2	And her surroundings.
nn	No,
sv	but, I've noticed that, this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past.
aa	Yeah,
sd	And, this year it's been so hot and, sunny
b	Uh huh.
b	 Yes,
sd	I was just talking to my son today,
sd	he really wished he could be here, rather than there.
bh	really.
b	Uh huh,
qy	do you think San Antonio is more comfortable than Dallas.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	it must be quite a bit hotter down there, isn't it?
ba	wow.
aa	yes.
b	yeah,
sv	I mean, that's really bad.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
ba	wow,
sd	some people say, they like to watch the changing of the seasons
sv	So, it's kind of a luxury.
sv	I guess we're supposed to say good bye or something, and think about what
aa	Yeah,
fc	Bye bye.
bh	Are you really?
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	and I know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole, you know, buy American, keep American auto workers working right now,
sd	If I were to buy another car, I would be partial to buying another Japanese car,
sd	So, if I were,
aa	Right,
sd	So I'm looking for more a two passenger car that,
^h	Well, I like the Miata,
sd	because I have an economy car right now, which is okay,
b	Right.
aa	Right,
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sv	and that was, I think, what really prejudiced me against American cars because I did not feel that it was a very quality, car.
sv	So, I guess you'd have to say, if I was looking, I would definitely be looking for a foreign car.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Which is a good deal.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Taxes.
qy	Do we pay too much?
qy	Well, do we?
sd	My tax bracket is pretty high up there.
sv	And, I think that we're paying too much
sd	And I pay a lot of property taxes.
sd	I don't, you know, I don't use an awful lot of city services.
sd	And, there's so many people who want a dib of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is
sd	many times I end up feeling like I'm paying too much in taxes.
qo	How about you?
sv	Well, when you when you go out into the, when you go out into the working world it changes quickly.
sd	you look at your paycheck
^2	To worry about it.
qy	have you been active in politics concerning this?
sd	I haven't done any of that type of work myself.
sd	but every once in a while when I hear up here at, in D C area, one of the radio stations has been talking about the Congress,
sd	And one of the Congressmen has written in the last three years about a thousand bad checks.
sd	And, it's causing quite a stir up here, because we're so close to D C anyway.
sv	It's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur.
sv	I, I think we pay too much.
sv	I think I pay forty two percent.
sd	Forty two cents out of every dollar I make goes to the government,
sd	and they charge me all these others,
sd	I can't believe that
qy	have you used, student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government?
qw	What are you studying down there?
b^m	Physics.
sv	that sounds like a fun field.
sd	Scientific.
bk	Okay.
ng	Actually, I don't think we are.
sd	like Europe, England. I know the taxes are a lot higher.
sd	But they do have socialized medicine and things like that.
sd	And, I know I was reading in the paper I believe yesterday that, they're talking,
qo	How about you.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	we're trying to,
ny	Yeah,
sd	But, we don't know how long it will be a dream.
sd	We're missionaries actually.
ny	Yeah,
sd	And it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home.
sd	Africa,
b	Yeah.
sd	About four years.
sd	we're with Wycliff Bible Translators.
b	Yeah,
no	we will be.
sd	And, came home and got married
sd	Well, I have a smattering of about ten different ones,
sd	So I know the greetings in about ten, and how to do market stuff,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	the State of Texas, for example, you know, may execute somebody twice a year.
sv	and that's certainly no kind of deterrent,
b	yeah.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	And, you know, this was her father, you know, that got killed, you know, just cold blooded murder, him and three other people,
aa	It does,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	it's, it's ridiculous.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
fc	All right,
fc	Bye bye.
b	Okay.
sd	I watch evenings because I work all day.
sd	mainly like ALL MY CHILDREN, that kind of thing.
ny	Yes.
sd	I tape THIRTY SOMETHING, and L A LAW.
sd	Those are the two I like the best.
sd	I know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I know.
b	Huh uh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I know.
ng	I don't usually like stuff that continues.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
nn	Huh uh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	And what night is it on?
ba	great.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
br	So he didn't go howl?
ba	how funny.
qy^d	It's just a half hour,
b	Oh.
sv	There's not many half hour shows,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	see, I like sports.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	I know.
b	No,
aa	I know.
sd	That's why I don't get to watch that much.
sd	I do okay, because the kids are all in bed,
sd	Or like at six thirty I'll watch WHEEL OF FORTUNE or something like that.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Did you send one?
ba	How funny.
b^m	Okay.
sd	Well, I'm the same way.
aa	Yeah.
sd	well, in the Carolina's it's just, you know, we've got a bunch of golf courses around here.
sd	well, I mean I'm not a serious golfer at all,
sd	but, I like watching it on T V.
o@	 Well, I, I, if I can hit a great deal like, they, my friends
sd	to get me they say I hit worm burners because I can't hit it up in the air.
sd	So I'm pretty bad
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, I guess that's what I need to do is get some kind of lessons or something.
sd	Just walking around the hollow and making sure there's not really,
sd	See how it's going to break or whatever.
ny	Yeah.
sv	if you get down on the ground you really can.
sd	well, you know if it's up on a slope that you've got to hit it not kill it
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	it's like I said
aa	I'm all set.
aa	that sounds good to me.
sd	Well, it, it usually takes me about probably two or three to get it there
sd	But the friends I play with, they play all the time
ar	they're not Joe Pros
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ar	No,
sd	Well, teeing off I either slice it
qy	Do you have any elderly relatives currently in an, nursing home now?
bh	Do you?
sd	She'll be a hundred and three in August.
sd	And we decide not to put her in a nursing home.
sd	even though she is a hundred and two, she still has all of her faculties.
sd	She still has her snap.
sd	I have seen them in the,
sv	I still think it is worth it if you had a good nursing home
b	Uh huh.
ba	well that's good.
ba	that is great.
b	why yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And the bad thing about it, before you can get any kind of government help, well you have to be a pauper.
sv	it takes every penny.
sv	And that's the sad part about it.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I work at a brokerage firm
ba	I can't imagine.
sd	And everybody in my family has always had,
sd	So, my mother and my father are in their late sixties.
b	I know.
b	but yeah.
sv	And that's the bad thing.
bk	Okay.
sd	I'm dying to see that.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh .
ba	my goodness.
sd(^q)	and I said, ooh, I want to see it so bad.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
ba	my.
sd	And when I go, I go see two at a time.
sv	hysterical.
b	Yeah
sd	that's the other one that we went to that night.
sd	And, my face hurt so bad, from laughing because I love Billy Crystal.
aa	they are
sv	they just carried it off, to the tee.
nn	No.
ba	How neat.
fe	Shoot,
b	yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
ba	gosh
sd	me too, because I don't even know if I could live through it now.
sd	I mean I'm getting around real good
sd	And today I, course I went back to work two weeks after,
sd	but see I don't have permanent work.
sd	so I went up to do WordPerfect cause that seems like that's what everybody wants,
sd	And then they called me to see if I wanted to work a day.
sd	And, you know, he was teasing me
sd	And so, I'm real glad that we didn't go see those funny ones when I'm still sort of on the sore side.
qw	well, what's your next,
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
sd	Supreme.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
aa	I do, too.
aa	I wouldn't think.
ba	Good .
sd	my parents took me when I was probably somewhere between Ashley and Jamie's age .
sd	And we went to the,
qy^d	Just to pack the bearings?
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	You know, they've gotten to the point that they don't weigh very much
b	Right.
sd	and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that.
sd	I get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car
sd	and one of the things that I did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine doesn't have to turn the accessories and can use more of the power to the rear wheels
sd	the only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that I put on it were, not even cast aluminum.
^h	Well, there's three pulleys that you change.
sd	So, when I changed those over, I put on these pressed aluminum things
sd	So in the process of seizing, the belt spun on the pulley and wore through the water pump pulley almost all the way. But not far enough to notice.
sd	So, I was on my way to work one day
fp	Hello.
fp	Fine.
b	Okay.
bk	Okay.
b	Okay.
sd	Arlington.
aa	Yes.
aa	Yes,
nn	No.
nn^r	No,
sd	I'm going to school right now.
co	I can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husband's or what I think.
sd	I've got a lot of,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
sd	go to work when I wanted to or not
sd	but, you know, the benefits weren't there.
bh	do you?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	and I'm the only one that's being insured
sv	so it's kind of,
sv	and the way medical expenses are I think that's probably one of the biggest benefits you need to have.
b	Right.
aa	It's out of sight.
sd	Even at a group rate, I couldn't believe how much is our,
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
aa	Right,
sd	They were paid that whole time
ny	Yes,
sv	I really believe they have done this to themselves, in a way, because of the unions being so stocked.
sd	And right now, anybody's that's laid off from G M will have a full year's paycheck.
sv	Plus probably an additional six months through the worker's stuff that they have at, through the company
sd	but I don't feel as sorry for them,
aa	Yes.
sv	But I think there's a case, where benefits have gotten,
sv	and it made the prices of cars go up
sd	we, I believe in unions,
sd	I mean, I can't make eighteen dollars an hour.
sd	Well, that's something I've thought a lot about.
sd	I work in a hospital.
sd	And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years
sv	when they asked us did we want to, keep it the same or, spend more, spend less, I think I think right now what they're spending is adequate. for my personal opinion. because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a, vaccine for.
sv	I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with
sv	or I think they already would have by now, you know.
sv	so I don't know if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now.
qo	And, what about you?
sd	I'm not either.
sd	that's something I've never really kept up with at all.
sd	I don't, I'm not sure,
sd	I know, I've always thought more about the disease rather than the research,
sd	if we were talking about the money, I'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough, simply because I don't know that much about it. You know .
b	yeah.
aa	I think so,
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
aa	No.
sd	Myself, I'm or about to, get a divorce
sd	and, course, I'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody I can or anything.
sv	But, it's sort of scary to find yourself single again, you know.
sd	And, because you never know what's going to happen .
sd	Course, it's not that I'm wanting to, I'm not going to want to go and have sex with everybody I see.
sv	But it's something you got to think about these days.
sd	A single person. You know,
sd	and, I mean, it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry.
aa	Certainly.
h	And, I don't know,
sd	I know it, sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction .
sd	It just sort of keeps that going.
h	But, I don't know,
h	so, I don't know,
h	I don't know,
o@	* this "it" needs separate slash mark because B.108 is an "aa" with A.107, not necesarily the original intended continuation of this utt It really is.
aa^m	It really is.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	so I don't know.
sv	so I guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse. Which is the most important to solve at the time
h	I don't know.
sd	but I've never looked into how much money they're spending.
sd	And I know a lot of our tax money goes to that.
sd	But, I really have never looked into it.
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah
aa	I think it is.
ng	That's one thing I've never really feared.
sd	a lot of my family, you know, they fear me working like that and, under some of those conditions,
sd	I work in the operating room a lot
qo	So how serious is the, subject of crime in your area?
ba	Jeez.
sd	Well, luckily, it hasn't gotten that bad here.
sd	San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime.
sv	but it's on the uprise, especially in a lot of the, outlying agricultural towns. because you end up having a lot of gangs forming, largely around the Hispanic core.
sv	it seems to be that, gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah .
ba	Well, that's efficient.
sv	They're decided they're completely unworried about being identified or anything of that sort.
ba	Wow.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, there's a couple of things that I've heard,
sv	course the reason that these kids tend to turn toward the drugs and everything else seems to be just, you know, the, the end results of poverty and parents that aren't doing any parenting and everything else
sd	because, I mean, you know, the parents aren't making a living at anything.
sv	And they're accidental parents half the time anyway.
sd	It's illegal,
b	Yeah.
sv	Well I think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of an actual solution to the problem.
sv	the social, the other social problems wouldn't go away.
sd	and I used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus,
sv	and prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really to slow,
sd	basically, they're just, having various recycling, bins, located for, trash pickup.
sd	live in an apartment complex.
sd	And they only have one set of recycling bins, one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters.
b	Right.
sd	and a lot of people are against it.
b	Right.
sd	I believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books.
sv	Well, part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper.
sd	They contain the glue and stuff
sd	Now I think they've come up with some way of, pulling the glue out.
sv	Well, I think that in some cases, it is warranted.
sv	I think in some cases it doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not.
sd	I mean I mean, I'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer
aap	Well, for some things.
sv	I think for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold blood,
sv	I mean, you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again.
sv	And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective.
sv	But, then, you know, I think that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment. You know, like, for example, you know, you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them
sv	and I don't think, that would really warrant capital punishment.
na	, it is to a certain extent
sv	but I think,
sv	I think in s ,
sv^m	Well, I think that would be kind of drastic punishment.
sv	But, one thing, I think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance should be investigated.
sv	But, like I said, if someone is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then I think they should be eliminated from society.
^2	And a lot of people that are a danger to society that aren't in prison.
sd	Well, I know in North Carolina, we do have capital punishment.
sd	And I'm from South Carolina.
ny	yes,
sd	I'm doing basically system design work and, implementation work for the speech group here.
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, i , I'm research stuff here now
b	Uh huh.
bf	If you want to, do it quickly.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
sd	And it's kind of split between C M U and, and, you know, the employee.
b	Right.
sd	That's a whole other topic to begin with too
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
sv	Now that's a big win.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	well if you could call it a benefit that C M U, I mean i ,
sd	so that kind of helps out in terms of, you know, keeping up to date with contacts in industry.
sd	You know, in case, you know, in case you ever need to bail out .
b	Uh huh.
aa	No,
ny	Yeah,
aa	That's right
b	Uh huh.
br^m	There's no sales tax either?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Right.
b	Yeah,
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
b^r	Right .
aa	That's right,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
aa	Right,
aa	Right ,
sd	I mean, I just read something that, two thirds or three quarters, I'm not exactly sure of our national debt was created during the Reagan Bush era who are supposedly fiscally conservative.
b	Right .
b^r	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
aa	Yeah,
sv	So that's really,
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
na	sure.
sd	And so I've seen a lot of like rallies and things like that.
sd	So, you know, you pick up some traits from her and stuff.
sd	but, you know, I believe in like sharing and doing things for each other.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	me too .
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ny	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	me too.
b	Yeah.
sd	And it's just too bad that some people, you know, still look down on them just because of their color. You know.
sv	Especially black women.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right,
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
^h	I'm not that big on politics.
aa	yeah.
sd	I don't know .
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	So that's good.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
nn	No,
sv	Well, I was, originally chosen primarily, I think, because I was a young fellow
ny	Yeah,
sv	Well, in a criminal case, say one in which, you know, there is, like, say assault or some such. I think there ought to be a unanimous, vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this.
ny	Yeah,
^h	well, I really can't say for certain, truth be known.
sd	A, fellow when he was much younger, was tried and convicted and sentenced to death.
aa	Yeah,
aa	certainly not,
nn	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
na^r	Right.
sv	there's no way.
sv	one man, one woman can never be objectionable in every case.
sd	every person has their opinions
b	Right.
aa	Right.
b	Yep.
b	Uh huh .
aa	that's right.
b	Right.
sv	Plea bargaining is something completely different.
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
b	Right.
sd	We do .
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
sd	We just have the case,
sd	his last appeal was denied two days before his sentence was up .
sd	So, I mean, his appeal was denied
sv	But, that was absurd .
sd	the, appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of.
aa	exactly.
aa	Exactly.
sv	No one would want the job .
sd	and, you know, like I said, you know, everyone has their opinions about every case.
ny	yeah.
qy	Well, I mean, were there witnesses?
aa	Right.
sd	I mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place
sv	and you'd still, there's still mitigating circumstances .
ny^e	I, yeah, I'm, yeah, I, I do aerobics, step classes and, toning classes,
ny	yes.
sv	it's a new, form I think,
aa	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
sd	and, I do toning a lot and, some,
sd	I'm not too great at it
b	Uh huh.
ba	Gosh .
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.

b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	there are things I should do.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sv	Those aerobic classes are tough the high impact.
sv	Definitely are tough classes.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	Well, now they have those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for like toning instead of using a weight,
sd	you have like bands,
sv	they're ... Yeah, they're, they're weird.
sv	you ge , they're just made of, I guess it's different kinds of rubber,
b	Uh huh.
sd	But, those classes I enjoy.
sd	I'm an interior design major, .
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah .

b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	I'm an electrical engineer.
sd	I work in Massachusetts actually.
sd	it's only about, half an hour.
aa	That's right.
ny	Yeah,
sd	That one little spot in New Hampshire, we have ten miles of coastline,
ng	Not up, where I live
^h	well, I'm only twenty seven years old
sv	That would be pretty good.
sd	I'm in for it.
aa	All right,
ny	Yeah,
sd	You too.
sv	I think we're going to have a white Christmas up here just like the song says.
nn	actually no,
ng	I don't watch a lot of it,
b	Yeah.
^2	And it's more in depth.
b	Yeah.
aa	I know,
b	Yeah.
b	I know,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	Well right now trying to keep abreast of, what's going on in Europe, you know, with all the, U S S R's satellites breaking off, trying to become independent and, you know, European community coming together.
sv	That's going to affect our, economy quite a bit.
b	yeah.
sv	I'm pretty sure it is, because, once Europe becomes unified and, their economy becomes one big economy we're going to be, kind of hurting .
aa	Yeah,
b	yeah
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
^h	Actually I'm not really into sports.
aa	Yeah,
fe	Whoa.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
qw	Where do you work?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b^m	Yeah,
sv	I think they should.
sd	I'm a T I employee
sd	some of the places now, like I B M don't allow them smoking, you know in the plant.
sd	we have designated smoking areas.
sd	But, I work in sort of a building that's not really, well
sd	And, they have designated smoking,
sv	and I think that's bad.
b	Yeah.
sd	and, I was giving my boss a hard time because I kept waiting for my name to come up, you know,
b	No .
na	Right,
ny	Uh huh.
sv	Which I thought was interesting .
b	Uh huh.
qw	what kind of drugs did you use, if you don't mind?
ba	Wow!
bh	Really?
sv	Well, it's really lucky that you got away from that.
sv	Cause that's really, downward spiral.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	Plus, you know, you want to think that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share, but that are not endangering your life,
sd	like, my husband, several years back, worked for Motorola.
sd	And they had, you know,
b	Yeah,
sd	like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water, you know, that kind of thing.
sd	And they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals.
sv	And that's really frightening.
sv	So I think some you know, places like that, it should be like mandatory like, you know, on a, on a greater frequency than maybe, just, you know, paper pushers like I am.
sv	well you'd think so
no	I don't know if they do it till yet.
sd	Because when he was at,
sd	I forgot what,
sd	And at that time, they had no testing whatsoever.
ba	Lord.
b	Yeah,
b	Ooh.
ba	That's awful.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
aa	Yeah,
b	Okay.
fc	Well, I enjoyed talking to you, Cathy.
sd	My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers.
na	You bet.
sd	when John Stallworth played he was from my hometown in Alabama,
sd	so I kind of grabbed on to that team, way back when.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	Well, they are exciting, aren't they?
sv	they are just a fun team to watch.
nn	 no,
bh	yeah?
ba	you're kidding .
ba	my gos ,
ba	I can't believe that.
ba	That's hilarious.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ba	boy.
qy	Well, do you think they're going to be able to make it this year, past the first playoff game?
qw	Who's that?
b	Right.
qo	What do you think about, Houston?
bh	yeah?
b	Huh.
b	yeah,
b	Right.
sd	Well, they squeaked out a game on Sunday.
sd	They played Dallas.
sd	They won, in overtime.
sd	I watched that game
na	Well, because I'm right here in Dallas I kind of pull for Dallas.
ny	Yeah.
sv	That's okay .
sd	and they just kind of grew on me.
b	Yeah.
^h	To tell you the truth I haven't paid too much attention to that.
qw	what cities are they looking at?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	You know, I think you are right.
sv	I think I remember hearing that.
sv	That would be fun.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
no	Well, it's about three hundred and fifty people.
sd	And they don't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything
sd	You know, they have a four O one K,
sd	They don't add anything.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's a pretty good deal.
qw	Now, how long does it take for your contribution to vest?
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	Well, it got all screwed up because I had a high deductible on the health insurance, no fault here,
bd	well.
b	Yeah,
ba	Aye.
b	Yeah,
qr	So you work for Bell or something like that?
bk	Right.
b^r	Right.
^2	A lifelong job security
^g	all that stuff,
b	Right.
qy	I mean, does it,
br	Mean the, the management they get rid of?
sv	Well, I would say as, far as social changes go, I think families were more together.
sv	they ate dinner at the table together.
sv	although I'm not a mother, I still think that, a lot has changed since ten years ago.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b^m	Twenty eight.
sd	So there's maybe a five year gap between us.
aa	Yes.
qy	Do you think it's an economic necessity
qy	I mean do you think, people really need two cars and a house in the suburbs or,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	so you think it's,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
sv	well I guess we're sticking more to social changes
sv	and not all of those are necessities.
sv	So they're trying to,
sd	the latest one I've seen, had to do with the, basically a manhunt,
sv	it was truly awful.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sv	that was great one.
sd	I loved it.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my.
aa	You bet, especially in the South.
qy^g	Well as I recall it got some Academy Awards, didn't it.
b	yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Oh.
sv	that was so funny,
sd	He had to buy his underwear at Kmart.
sv	That was hilarious.
sd	and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image.
sv	Unbelievable.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	but, boy there's a lots going on in there .
b	Yeah,
sv	and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it, you know,
b	Yeah.
aa	Right,
sd	I can tell you, so much about that movie, just because it really rang a lot of my personal background.
sd	and then, you know, for, for no real, you know, direct reason, I guess, we get into, a really good relationship for a while and then, you know, back and forth
aa	Yeah,
aa	Uh huh.
sd	and, it was like pulling teeth to go get him to see it
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
^2	And to make it believable.
sd	I mean I was believing it,
sv	He did great.
fc	Yeah,
fc	No,
fc	Bye, bye.
bh	Do you?
qw	How old is it?
sv	you're, you're in the roughest stages of pet ownership, I think.
sv	Well. I don't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence, really, the, the training bit,
sd	but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog.
h	I don't know.
sv	They say that's not the way to do it now.
ar	No,
b	Yeah.
aa	No,
qy	does it just want to sniff around?
qy	Does it just want to sniff around and play when it's outside?
b	Yeah.
qy	Have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside?
b	Yeah.
^2	That's nothing,
sd	so we're battling with that problem
sd	and she still feels good.
sd	She'll be sixteen in May.
b	And yeah,
sd	so we're putting up with all her accidents,
sd	two nights ago, she had diarrhea,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	Does it,
b	Oh.
sd	Well, you know, we went to the junior college, Richland
sd	and we took,
sv	and, it, it's a pretty good class,
sd	So, she didn't learn a lot,
sd	I think it was like a six week program.
sd	I think it was one night a week for like six weeks,
sd	and, you know, it was a group class, outside.
b	Yeah,
sd	our friend has a,
b	Okay.
br^m	Saginaw?
bh	Really?
sd	we live in Plano
sd	and you set it out
qy	did they, like on bottles, did they give you so many cents back for for cans
b	Yeah.
nn	No,
sd	So you don't see too many thrown out around the streets. Or even bottles.
sv	You know, all kinds of bottles they, they really charge people I guess when you purchase them and then when you turn them back in.
sd	I remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Right.
sd	That was my brother's first job in a grocery store.
sd	It's pretty dangerous out there, you know, when they fall over,
sd	they say that the green glass now, that there's a big glut of green the green glass,
ny	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	people just,
h	I don't know,
aa	That's right,
sv	We all do it .
ny	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	Well, we're doing it for a church choir
ny	Yeah.
ft	Well, thank you.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	pretty good, actually.
sd	I've got a Bachelor's in electrical engineering
sd	And I'm not, like, a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff.
sv	anyway, our benefits are pretty good.
sd	but, there's a four O one K plan for, sheltering some taxable income.
sd	I've been with them for seven years.
sv	And, and a lot of the stuff, the best thing is like four years or five years, it's pretty soon, you're completely vested in the retirement plan and everything,
sd	but th , there's several medical plans to choose from, that cover pretty much everything.
sd	they don't cover eyes though,
sd	But, you know, I I can live,
aa	yeah,
b	Right.
ny	Yeah,
sv	I guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that
sd	but that's not the case,
sd	so, I guess nothing.
qo	what about you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	I, myself have moved around quite a bit within the company
sd	and I, and I haven't had to move my residence to do that.
b	Yeah
bh	yeah?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	and he moved his family back east a few years ago to take that position.
sd	Well, I have a, pretty wide taste, in music, ranging from progressive rock to jazz to, lot of different forms of, music.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I don't mind music that's difficult to listen to,
sd	lot of stuff that actually has, ended up becoming popular like, Nirvana and, you know,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I think it is.
sv	for a while there, popular music seemed to have, not a lot of point to it.
sv	And I could, go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money.
aa	I guess.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I like a lot of classical music,
^h	Stuff that I like,
h	and some stuff that I like,
sv	and that's interesting music,
sd	and it, it just isn't chance taking enough for me.
b	Yes.
ny	Yes,
sd	Tibby and Liberty.
sd	Tibby is the dog
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you want to hear about my other animals I've had?
sd	I've had a skunk
sd	I've had a Burmese python,
^h	let's see,
sd	So at one point I had a snake, skunk, dog and cat running loose in the house.
ny	Yes
sd^e	it was litter trained
sd	and we had it perfumed
sd	and, it was very aggressive.
sd	But all three of them, dog, cat and skunk, used to chase each other all through the house.
sd	And the only thing we have with the skunk, he was very, very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa.
sd	Nobody came near it when he was there.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
sv	That'd be the best way to be.
sd	Well we had a German Shepherd
sd	and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went.
sd	So, when he died, we got a little one.
sd	But our shepherd was almost thirteen years old,
aa	Yeah,
sd	So we said the next time around we'd get something little that if something happened, it would be easier to carry.
sd	And then we've had three cats in our married life,
qy	Do you?
b	Yeah,
sd	and my husband, then fianc3e, was to keep my cat,
sd	And we had such a time, and never got the cat back.
ny	Yeah,
sd	I was a social worker at the time, and found it,
sd	Well, it's an older home.
sd	Got three bedrooms, one bath and that just makes me scream.
sd	I live in Houston.
^h	Well, for the neighborhood I'm in,
sd	This is one of the more established neighborhoods,
sd	The whole lot I'm sitting on is roughly half an acre.
sd	About half of that, about a quarter acre of that, I've got a garden.
sd	Well, in the, newer neighborhoods and development communities, the houses are so close together,
sd	if your neighbor is having an argument you can here it blow for blow.
ny	Yeah.
sd	new houses that I've seen.
^2	It helps a bunch.
b	Yeah.
sd	Most of the neighborhood I'm in is pretty typical.
sd	Everybody has got a , pretty good size yard,
sd	I mean, I got probably the biggest,
sd	Well, I, I enjoy that though.
sd	It's rained .
nn	No,
ny	Yeah.
ba	Wow.
sv	Living in the city has some advantages.
sd	If given the choice, I'm getting out.
sd	That's just something I'll never adapt to.
sd	If I want to sit around and mess with my garden, I'll mess with my garden,
sd	if I want to work in the flower beds,
na	Very much.
b	Huh uh.
no	landscaping is more, than the gardening,
sd	in the garden I've got my beans, peas,
sd	I've got some onions out, tomatoes,
sd	I'm not real sure what they're going to do this year.
sd	my favorite one is putting on the, tomato plant dust,
sd	and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time,
sd	Well, I've done some rewiring on it.
sd	Eventually, if we stay here, I'm going to have to rewire the entire house.
sd	I've talked about adding at least one more room and definitely adding another bath on.
ng^m	Not even a half bath.
sd	The only thing that saves it, with the schedule I work and the schedule my wife works, we're getting ready to go to work at totally different times. So that. It's not like we're tripping over each other in the morning.
sv	It doesn't work if you're trying to shave and she's trying to put her eyeliner on
na	I've got one.
sd	he's nine months old.
sd	He likes to dig around a little bit.
sd	He was eating the dirt,
sd	Well, that's what I've always,
sd	After we got married we ended up moving to the Houston area.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh,
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
sd	so they come in,
sd	I don't really have this major budget or anything.
sd	so, that's what I do.
b	No.
b	Uh uh.
sd	you buy something on credit
sv	and you pay twice as much for it when you get done. You know
b	Uh huh.
sd	I don't have too many, I don't have too many weaknesses,
aa	Yeah,
sd	but I, self employed, you know,
nn	No,
sd	So, I always do my own income tax, you know.
qy	Do you?
sv	all you got to do is read a book, I mean read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go.
sv	I mean, it seems absurd that people will pay, you know, some bucks just to get someone to,
sv	it's dumb .
sd	But, I don't use a calculator either, you know .
sd	I don't have that many, you know, things to add up
b	yeah.
qy	Do you do that?
qy^d	You do too?
sd	And I always check them off and, you know, check my balance and my book you know, because I always want to know exactly what I have, you know.
sd	I do that real often.
sd	I have ambivalent feelings because I don't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is.
sd	And it's eating us alive budget wise
ny	Yes,
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, I think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people. You know, who would see it.
b	Yeah,
bf	Quicker maybe,
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, see, I'm a school principal.
sd	And in a very poor section of town with predominantly Anglo kids.
sv	but I think we would make a bigger investment in kids,
b	yeah.
sd	Well I'm not talking about just in the school system.
sd	See, I'm talking about,
sd	Five hundred of them are good, solid kids
sd	And, you know, you just see those kids going down the road.
sv	I think that's one reason we have problems in schools,
sv	But that's another subject
sd	I dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody making a decision what to do with them.
b	Uh huh.
qy	do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard?
sd	Statistically, that's true.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qw	What kind of crimes would you use it for?
bk	Uh huh.
sd	I would consider it for sexual abuse of children, on going. You know, not one instance, but perpetual abusers of children.
sd	Well, you know, somebody elected that recently.
sd	And all the civil rights people are up in arms about it, you know.
cc	Okay.
sd	And plus, for me, it's, I mean like medical and you know, benefits and dental.
sv	They're also important.
qy	Are they like pretty much train for a specific job
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sv	Well, you know that's interesting though.
sv	that use to be I think a couple of years ago,
sd	I mean, you know, some people had been there a long time.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^m	Expedient,
b	Yeah
sd	And then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sv	I think probably in a small,
sv	Probably, where as in a bigger corporation, I think you're just a number, you know.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
nn	No.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think it's a good idea.
sv	I think it's,
qy	Did you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	they were, they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do.
b	Uh huh.
qy	but even through those groups, do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to?
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I live in Richardson right now. Which is just,
aa	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean a real small town .
b	Uh huh.
sd	I don't know how young you'd have to go
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That's probably true.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's great.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's great.
b^m	Okay.
fc	Well, good talking with you.
fc	You too.
fc	Okay.
fc	Bye .
b	Uh huh.
bf	And a lot of hassle all year round
b^m	Yeah.
nn	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, it would get messy, too.
sd	I, I know other places when they recycle, they have to, like, wash out their glass jars and whatnot. which we're not in the habit of doing.
sd	I was brought up, you know, long time ago, that they didn't even have cans.
sd	and you'd get our money back
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	right.
sd	But, we did buy a can crusher
sv	it was just easier to do that than to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat.
sd	So that's the main reason we, sort of are into cans at this point rather than the liter bottles .
^h	Well, as you say, it takes a while to build it up.
na	fantasizing about.
sd	and I have a mini van we bought a few years ago.
sd	and the car I get to drive is a, Nissan Sentra that's going to be ten years old next month
sd	Well , since I just turned forty, I'm thinking about a forty year old man's car, something real sporty
sd*	but, realistically with, the need to take the kids to school, probably have to have something that, wouldn't wined up putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat. / * spelling wined should be wind
sd	Something a little seating room.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b^r	Sure.
aa	Yeah,
sv	And, you know, V eights seem to be a return to the days of, you know, ten or twelve miles a gallon.
b	Sure.
sv	Actually, pretty good way of looking at it,
sd	A case where there was a, sort of freak ice storm
sd	Haven't had any problems since.
sd	It's a Mazda.
sd	And, we're pleased with it in terms of comfort, and, driveability.
sd	so we've been able to do some real creative, load hauling when called upon.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	I'd be satisfied with a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra.
sv	And even as light as that is with, the small tires it's done pretty well in winter,
sv	again, like you, if conditions are that bad, I probably don't want to be driving anyway.
sd	So I know I'd be happy with a reasonable, four door.
qy	Are you in the part of town where, they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling?
aa	Well, maybe they don't.
b	Yeah,
sv	it will be interesting to see how well that works
sd	and you got a nickel or dime, which in that time was a lot of money, when you returned them.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	So, you know, I look back at, my childhood
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	but on the plastic, I don't have any habits there yet
sv	and I think if we just start to put, you know, the nickel deposit on things, like, was the case years ago that, it would have more immediate effect,
sv	and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window
b	Yeah.
sv	well that's interesting because,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, it will be interesting to see how, over the next year, this all works out because, like on the, grass, I know your husband, doesn't really like the paper sacks.
b	Yeah.
sd	so I'm glad the city's willing to take that on.
sd	Well, there's someplace, you know,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right .
aa	yeah,
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
ar	No,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	you mean she taught in a prison?
b	Oh.
b	I see.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	well, I think the people yeah, that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical, you know.
b	Yeah,
sv	Those are funny labels, see .
b	yeah.
sv	I mean, as, you know, as poverty has gotten worse, as, you know, education has gotten worse, as there's been more single parent families, as there's been more homelessness, there's been more crime.
aa	Yeah,
qy	Is he the guy wants to, like, deregulate heroin, or something?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
na	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	well, I don't pretend to understand that either.
sd	Well, that's I meant when I said the school.
sv	Well, that's odd because I don't think the teachers in my school district, were well paid.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
fp	Hi.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Any particular reason? .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I really don't,
sv	and, I guess you could explain it two ways.
sv	And I think the same thing is true with news.
sv	If you were deeply involved in it, then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want they're not printing because the average person doesn't need or want to know that much.
sv	Well, I mean, there's a reasonable question as to whether it's worth the amount of time it takes to keep up on things .
sv	And most people think it is
ar	I don't think it's that high.
sd	I know a lot of people who may watch the T V news in the evening but don't spend the time to actually read a newspaper.
sv(^q)	And I think they're saying well if something's really important, I'll at least find out that it happened.
sv	and that's, is a reasonable start
sv	And I imagine you get the same level of something that you cared about happened, you'd find out from friends or other channels .
bf	Clarence Thomas or,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I decided I didn't want to waste the time
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well see, I started saving newspapers
sd	and, I can't remember where I went to take them,
aa	I know.
^2	There is no really recycling facilities.
sv	I think that is a good idea.
bf	Besides, well like a law or whatever.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Plus you have to have a place to store all of it
sd	and see I live in an apartment.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bf	so that way it kind of forces you to recycle.
aa	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
^2	That take them back.
qy	Is Texas one of them?
b	Yeah.
sd	And we have a paper recycling program that, is company wide
ny	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
sd	But, we use to have,
sd	I mean they have made a substantial amount of money from it.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
aa	Well I know,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
qy	I mean, I don't know that much. Do they not ever burn trash or anything like,
sd	Then, that's pollution.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	It is really sad.
sd	Well, here in Seattle, the air's getting more and more polluted.
b	Uh huh .
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sd	We have that here
b	Yeah.
b	really,
qw	Now where does the source light go?
bk	I see.
ba	Jeez.
b	Yeah.
sd	But if I take the bus, it requires several transfers
sd	And you know, I feel guilty cause I'm driving a ,
aa	Right,
b	Right.
sv	committing them mostly is, you know, either crimes of passion or at the moment
b	Yeah,
sd	Whereas if you kill him, there is not that possibility.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
aa	yeah,
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	you will work your prison job
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	I work for Georgia Tech.
sv	And, on a scale, I guess it's still considered small.
sd	The area I work in, it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so.
sd	So that's make up most of the laboratory
qo	What about yourself?
bk	okay.
bk^r	okay.
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well those and probably the security aspect of it.
sd	Because a lot of time nowadays, even though you're working, you're treated,
sv	Because when it come down to layoff, they don't really consider people and, you know, their well being as far as, you know, how their next dollar going to come in.
sd	And I was reading this book one time about this guy that had,
sd	That way that, you know, one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time.
sv	And, you know, I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better, you know, other than you know, something like,
sv	You know. Because it's not a person's fault that, you know, people not buying or businesses are not on the up and up all the time, you know.
qw^d	Well in a sense that say, how do you make a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people. for the bad times of the company.
qw^d	What about the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well.
ny	yes,
sd	I really do.
sv	and, you know, there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at one time.
h	You know. that's my views, you know.
b	Right.
sv	Well at least that would give a person a chance to look you know. Because the way it is, a person really don't have a chance .
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	the things that we kind of looked at is you want to see how many teachers you have. and how many kids they have and how they break it up.
sv	Because we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in.
sv	it was a really good one,
sd	But they didn't have enough teachers
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	did they separate them by age group?
sv	Because you know, I think that's one thing that was important.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	it sound,
sv@	It sounds like to me your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people. .
sv	Affectionate people that they're, they're kind of par , may be parents themselves or something.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	and we knew them from other associations
sd	he would, you know, laugh with the kids and play with the kids
b	Yeah,
sd	but they also did some of the teaching things
sd	you know so you know, they used, I think they used the,
sd	I can't remember what they call it actually
sd	And they have to stand there,
sd	I have a personal computer at home.
sd	I also have a P C at work that I use as a terminal.
qo	What about you?
qy	Are you leasing them?
qy^d	Loaners from work?
qy	Do you work for T I?
qw	What brand are they?
bk	Uh huh.
ba	I'm jealous.
qw	What kind of consulting do you do?
b	Uh huh.
qw	What kind of work do you do when you're consulting?
qy	Is it programming related?
b	Uh huh.
bf	Word processing.
nn^e	No I'm not familiar with that.
b	Uh huh
bf	So, you've got a modem in it then.
qy^d	At home you have a modem that you can connect to each of them?
qy^d	and so it's an external modem.
sd	when I got mine I had an internal modem in it
sd	I used it, quite a bit when I was, looking at, information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a newspaper in Fort Worth
sd	but, went out of town for a while,
sd	and after a while the modem started making noises on its own even without using it on the computer,
sv	I think that's the thirty second warning.
ny	Yes.
aa	Okay.
qy	Are you at home now?
qy^d	So you've got a lot of traffic noise real close.
qw	What time is it now where you are?
sd	So you're an hour ahead of where I am.
nn	No,
b	Yeah,
sd	I have used Lotus.
sd	not heavy use.
sd	and I have a great deal of respect for it.
sd	I haven't done much word processing work with my job.
sd	and the D Base work I've done was strictly class related.
sd	Well, it's probably the granddaddy of most, data base management systems.
sd	It's got some pretty strong competitors.
sd	I can understand that very easily.
sv	and both of those seem very easy to use compared to D Base.
sv	I wouldn't say compatible, but certainly comparable.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm a computer programmer on the I B M main frames.
sd	I do, mainly business data processing.
sd	I also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility.
sd	sometimes I get called late at night at home because there's a production problem,
sd	I also, handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who need to find out something connected,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	I wonder,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	and I've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, the one thing that I know does seem to happen from people I've talked to on this, is that in the situation you just said where it's nine to three, or some such number, that there's starts being a lot of peer pressure going on
sd	and that, peer pressure,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
qy	You ever seen that movie?
b	, yeah,
qy^d	I guess, I think, I wonder if that worked.
sd	I think it usually does.
b	Okay
nn	No,
qy	do you have kids?
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ny	yeah
sd	and she's able to take her baby to work with her.
sd	And it's a small office that she works in
sd	and, it's a legal office,
sd	And so they have an extra room and everything for the baby,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
qy	Worried that they're not going to get enough attention?
b	Yeah.
aa	Yes.
aa	Yeah,
sv	Anything, I guess, could happen.
qy^d	I guess after he, you know, gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care.
b	Yeah.
sd	when he's not, when she can't keep control of him
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
no	I don't know
sv	I always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time.
qy	Is that what you do?
bf	so they don't go to school.
sv	That's interesting.
bf	So they haven't been to public schools at all.
sd	I'm Ann.
br^m	Criminal courts?
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
b	Oh.
sv	Well, that videotape was just horrible.
aa	Yes.
aa	I agree with you
b	Right.
aa	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
aa	exactly.
o*	There. /* listen
qo	What about the judge who's hearing the case?
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
ba	my goodness.
^2	To get that judge recalled I would think.
sv	That's almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized sentences.
aa	It would.
sd	the whole world would know what you were facing.
b^m	Angie,
qw	Well, now, so if you were going to have a dinner party, what would you make?
sv	That sounds good.
br	Now what is, the steamed shellfish you said?
qr	And what would that be like, a clam or,
bk	Okay.
qw	So if you have a dinner party and you're going to serve, seafood for supper, what type of, hors d'oeuvres would you serve prior to the meal?
qy^g	Probably not nachos and dip,
qy	And would it be appropriate to, drink when you have the hors d'oeuvres?
bk	Okay.
na	That would be my guess.
sd	And, And then, dessert.
qy^d	Something sweet?
qy^d	You must like chocolate.
^h	Well, let's see.
sd	So, we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe some dip, some cheese.
sd	and then you just dip the cracker in the sauce with the clams and the cream cheese
sd	and then, I don't know what we usually have for dessert.
sv	But I guess when you talk about dinner party, that's probably not, that's more for like when friends come over.
sd^r	Traditional,
sv	I wouldn't be the big, snotty kind.
nn	Huh uh.
qy	well, do you work in a setting where you, are in the food business?
qy	in, Is it in Dallas?
bk	Okay,
b^m	Trinity,
bk	okay,
qy^d	and he's not interested in letting his twenty one year old daughter experiment with it probably.
sv	that would be good.
sv	And you could actually go with, a chicken if you wanted to.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I, I worked on some of it at T I once upon a time.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Well, actually I, I'm quite versed lately.
b	Yeah,
ny	yeah
sd^e	I think I would.
sd	Well, you know, I had a tire come off of a car,
sd	Depending on what was left of my technology to get me home .
aa	Yeah,
sd	Well at least we're going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and they'd go up, you know, and do things
b	Oh.
b	yeah.
sd	But, Russia's still going to have missiles,
b	Yeah.
sd	Latest I heard it was just going to be Russia itself that was going to have them.
h	At least you know, that's what everybody says.
sd(^q)	And now they're saying, Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sv	One hopes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	well, I don't know exactly what's hot down in Texas.
b^m	Folk music.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm more, old rock and roll, some newer, I guess you would call it heavy metal rock and roll type you know, Van Halen, that kind of thing.
sd	I don't listen to the radio at all.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
aa	You know, definitely.
b	Yeah,
sv	plenty.
aa	Yeah,
sv	But, it's getting pretty big everywhere, as I see it.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
aa	No,
sd	you hear a Paula Abdul song
sv	Madonna can do anything
sd	Madonna could start playing folk music
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ny	yeah,
sv	it's, you know, it's way to hectic and too confusing.
ny	yeah,
sd	and I listen to it that way,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	yeah.
aa	Right.
sd	And, we've done lots to it.
ny	Uh huh.
qo	How about you?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh .
ba	Wow.
ba^r	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Nice.
ba^r	Nice.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
ba	That's great.
ny	Yeah,
b	Right.
nn	No.
sd	see in a lot of the windows?
sd	the house is eighty years old
ny	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sd	And the ones that would open, wouldn't want to stay open .
b	Uh huh.
ng	Atlanta is kind of high.
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
sd	There are some, but not very high.
sv	so that's kind of like a double assault there.
bh	Really?
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	okay.
sd	it's not like, it's someone do steal a or television or V C R or something like that
sv	so you really not making a sizeable profit.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sv	ou , our judicial system is in such total chaos.
sd	All the people signed confessions,
sd	And what they've done is they've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they've done,
aa	that's true.
sd	I hold it in the utmost contempt.
qh	So where do you think they target their efforts?
sv	They target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals.
sv	I've nailed the problem down
aa	Yeah,
sv	I think somehow you have to separate the revenues from,
aa	Now, I firmly believe in that
sd	And here's this bum that didn't have a job
sd	and he's got a attorney that you and I could never afford.
qh	Who's paying for that?
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
bk	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Okay.
b	Yep,
ba	Wow.
sd	and I'd love to go back.
b	Yeah,
sd	we had a great time.
sd	Well, we, as you do, take family vacations, sometimes one a year,
sd	And we, we really love cruises.
sv	And, we've gone fairly inexpensive as most cruises go.
sd	And we get upgraded.
sd	my God, you do everything.
sv	And that's quite fun.
sd	Nassau, San Juan, Saint Thomas.
sd	And then we went to, the western Caribbean, which is, Port, Cancun, Cozumel, and Ocho Rios.
br	Pardon me?
aa	Yes,
sd	We're from Illinois originally.
sd	And we've been down in Texas eighteen years,
sv	And that's fun.
sv	things are different there, though.
bh	Did you?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's great.
sv	they, they really are.
sd	My husband would, you know,
sd	But I like all of that.
sd	I like seeing other countries and shopping in other places.
sd	I like shopping.
sd	So I'm kind of looking forward to that, except I hate to see them go.
sd	that's what everybody says,
sd	So that will be hard to stay away from.
b	Yeah.
aa	Isn't that the truth,
sd	Well, there's all age groups too,
sd	You may meet people, you know, thirty years older than you, or younger,
sd	we've only gone on the seven day cruises.
sd	They have shorter ones
sv	I think most vacations, seven days is enough for us.
b	Yeah.
sd	Went to Panama last August.
sd	Our son in law is from Panama.
sd	And, we went with our daughter and son in law to visit his parents, who live there.
sd	And his father is a doctor
sv	And it is gorgeous.
sv	And, it's just, it's just a gorgeous country.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	Well, that's, that's pretty good.
qy	do you like L A?
b^m	Okay,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Well, yeah,
sd	I grew up in New York
sd	or not New York City, upstate New York
sd	and I went to, the City of Rochester School District
sd	and a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs
sv	and, one of the things that probably would have been better is if the entire county had just one school system.
sv	And that could result in more equitable distribution of money
sv	As a result, the schools were rundown,
sv	so you know, I think that one of the ways to, to help schools in general, and get them all to a minimum level of, of competency almost, would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people,
sv	So, you know it's kind of, you end up chasing, like a dog chasing its own tail sort of.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw^r	Why is that?
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	ended up getting some scholarships to go to college you know, which is really nice,
sv	and I think the difference for me was that you know, they were definitely, they were always there,
^q	yeah,
fp	Hello Chuck.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I didn't think that was a new revelation.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ba	Well, that's good.
aa	Right.
sv	and, I think they are even putting it in the roadways these days
b	Uh huh.
b	really.
b	Right.
sd	Well, it's carbon
b	Oh.
b	Okay .
aa	No.
qy	Did it change anything for you?
qw	what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though?
sv	Well, I mean, it seems to me that, generally, at least in my own experience, when I purchase something mail order, it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania.
sv	it's because I can't find the item that I want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area.
no	Well, I think that if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then I don't argue with it.
aa	Right.
qr	do you mean businesses from the point of view of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax? Or purchasing.
b	Yeah.
sd	So, my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer.
nn	No.
b^m	Uh huh.
bf	they thought it was too much of a bother.
aa	Right.
sd	Because I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still.
sd	They wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well a lot of it's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help.
sd	They need health care
sv	That's probably a large factor.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right,
sd	So that was their thinking.
sd	And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make. So they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time.
sv	I guess that's a problem too for people. Wait lists and all.
sv	you can't always get in when you want too
b	Yeah.
sv	At that stage of life you only have so much money left
sv	I mean it is kind of fair,
sv	So it's another problem.
aa	Right,
sv	It's just a shame that's the way it has to be.
sv	and cause like if your spouse died, all alone, it'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you. To have friends.
ny	Yeah,
sd	I have two children,
sd	so I try to spend as much time as possible with them.
sd	Well, we do a lot of things with them, you know,
qy	was it a big change in your life, to, have a child.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	Well you said you worked a couple days a month, though,
qw	what do you do?
bh	are you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	But my wife was,
sv	You know, to go from, you know, nothing, you know,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
qy	are you from the Maryland area?
bh	Really.
sd	I'm in Dallas, Texas.
b	Yeah,
b	yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
bk	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	and so that got me to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff, you know, 'cause normally if they need something they just go to mom. No matter what it is,
sd	I mean, I'm perfectly capable of doing it for them,
sv	I guess they get used to it.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Uh huh,
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b^r	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah,
b^r	Yeah,
sv	it's hard because, you know,
b	So, yeah,
b	Uh huh,
sd	So she's had about enough during those days,
sv	like what you said with the cost of living and everything, I think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary an and won't.
sv	And so I think that's tended to lead to a decline in families and family values especially.
sv	And I really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that, you know, we need to do something about,
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh,
aa	Uh huh.
sd(^q)	and, you think, if I wasn't here he'd be learning that from a baby sitter or from a day care.
sv	You know, that's how they're developing their patterns.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh,
fc	Well it's been nice talking to you.
fc	Okay
fc	Okay,
sv	Well, I think that it varies on the individual basis.
sd	you do not have, family available or family that's,
sv	So, sometimes it's not an alternative.
sv	especially if it's after an acute illness.
sv	you know, sometimes the nursing homes are good for, just short periods of time.
aa	Uh huh.
sv	So so there is some good to it.
sv	sometimes too, it's used as a dumb job.
sv	and they don't want to take the responsibility
o	So you see,
b	Yeah.
aa	That's true.
sv	I think that's also where you're going to have a lot of people who are going to,
sd	So that option sometimes is not available if they do not have either Medicare or insurance to cover it.
b	Yeah,
sd	I know some.
sv	And you need a special nursing home for that.
sv	and you need people who are trained for that type of problem.
aa	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
bf	Gives her a little bit of her own independence
bf	but she still has, a security there.
ba	That's right
sd	and also they have a lot of, activities going on for the ones who are more active.
sv	So it's not sort of like, a sick place.
b	Yeah
sd	and, you know, sometimes those choi , those choices can be made in advance
^h	That's a good question.
sd	And, try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment.
sv	it's a question of your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response.
sv	and that was the thing that, killed Dukakis back, four years ago when someone asked him a similar question
sv	And I think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level.
sv	I think people are working at that from more of a gut reaction than a reason humane one.
aa	That's true.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I don't know if that would really work that way or not.
sd	well actually my dad's, my dad's almost ninety
sd	but, some friends of mine have, gone through this.
qy	Do you have any experience with this yourself?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf^g	From the lack of stimulation, you mean.
qy	Do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with, that the people who operate it seem to have, what you'd perceive of as genuine concern?
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	But I also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because I think they provide, a lot of social activities.
sd	one of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities
sv	Well I think t , it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there
ny	Yes.
sd	well DOW JONES for example cause the news wire
sd	and it's picked up and actually available, at my office,
sd	Well, it's similar to that,
ng	well actually not.
sv	I'd like to say however, that I'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires .
sv	I think that it has to do with,
aa	Yeah.
sd	and, the other thing that I always notice is that whenever they write about something that I'm an expert in, I find their descriptions to be wrong
aa	That's right.
sv	I think both.
sd	So, to give you an example, we will go out of the printing media.
sd	I mean he does that.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	So, if at a particular time, you wanted to get the latest and greatest news you could do that by, turning on C N N
fp	Hi.
fp^m	Hi,
sd	Pennsylvania.
bh	really?
ba	that's neat.
qy^d	television shows?
b	Sure,
b	Okay.
na	Sure am.
b	Okay,
qw	What are your favorite television shows?
bh	really?
sv	I love that show.
ny	Yes,
sd	I heard they just canceled that.
sd	I read in today's paper they just canceled that show.
qy	Have you seen the show, it's new this year, called HOME FRONT?
sv	it's really good.
sd	and it's set in post World War Two times
sv	It's kind of like a nighttime soap opera type thing.
sv	it's a good, it's really well written.
sd	I don't even know, to tell you the truth .
sd	I prefer OPRAH WINFREY to DONAHUE .
b	Oh.
sd(^q)	and now when I watch them, I think, why did I ever watch those?
sv	They're stupid .
sd	So when I did watch them I was addicted to them every day.
sd	But not anymore.
sd	tonight I'm looking forward to seeing GOLDEN GIRLS.
aa	Yes,
sd	And if I can stay up late enough, I like to catch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE every now and then.
sd	And right now we're watching a Penn State football game because that's where we live.
sv	It's exciting,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes,
sd	We'll catch our news that way.
sd	Lately, I haven't been catching it because of my work schedule.
sd	I can't remember the last time I saw it.
sd	Well, today on C N N they were talking about something like this about, learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research that's going on which is kind of what we're doing, helping them get a data base for words.
sv	It was really interesting.
qy	Do you work for Texas Instruments?
ba	that's nice.
b	Sure,
sv	Well, they do have, a major internal problem .
sd	Well, I do realize that, the Bush Administration isn't too happy with how they're handling their internal, strife, you know, as far as diplomacy is concerned .
b	yeah.
sv	Well, that's all they got right now.
sv	So, you know, they'll go with , you know, whoever comes through for them.
sv	And I think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how, in order to keep the peace on both sides.
sv	And that's the situation that he finds himself in,
sv	but I just think that because of the basic needs that the people don't have,
sv	I think it's a lot of, oh, how do you put it? , bureaucracy and, one thing, and then all the corruption.
sv	I I know you're going to have that with every society.
sv	but if it gets to a point where people can't , survive, I mean, there's revolution. You know,
aa	Yeah ,
sv@	Anyway, I really question, though, how much technology the average Soviet is exposed to.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah .
aa	This is true.
qy	So the original question, do we think their you know, a security threat?
no	yes and no.
aa	no.
sv	and they put their pants on the same way,
qw	What kind of music do you like?
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you like, like rock and those kind of things punk even.
ar	I don't think they have a whole lot to say, even .
am	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
sv	Some of it is kind of pointless,
aa	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b^r	Yeah.
sd	I guess I don't really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times.
sd	I'm, with you though,
sd	I don't like to listen to it all the time, but, some of the time, anyway.
b	yeah .
sd	Some of it kind of falls in the rap category I guess,
b	Yeah.
sv	a lot of them, sound, really similar,
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, that's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes, too, I guess.
sv	you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some of them, too.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah
sd	I say they,
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Probably more tuned in to that.
sd	I'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole,
na	I think that's, I think that's the way it is.
sd	they, they decide whether or not the accused or whatever would get the death penalty.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I guess the way I think about it it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge.
ad	put it to sleep, you know.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I believe it is in capital.
sd	I believe that's the way it is.
b	Uh huh.
ba	no .
ad	I'm telling you, go one way or the other.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
sd	That has been going on .
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
nn	No
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I don't really think that it's, too many,
sv	Well, I think I think the problem here is that a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs.
sv	There's too many cases where it can, you know,
sv	like I said, some industries, though, I think it'd be very necessary,
sv	But, I just, I find it to be pretty offensive that it's such a big deal.
ny	yeah,
sd	I. I mean, I was very offended by the whole process.
sv	I mean it's very humiliating,
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	just to the fact that I don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what it's employees are doing when they're not at work.
b	Right.
aa	That's exactly right.
sv	And also I just think it gets a lot,
na	I really think it should be, except as I've mentioned twice now, in the specified industries or jobs, because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times.
sv	And other than that I do not think it should be allowable.
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
^2	In your spare time.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	I, I can't really say that we have hobbies.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I guess mostly as far as crafts go, I've done, some needlepoint.
sd	and then you have a little picture of them
sd	but nothing steady.
aa	No.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	No.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	I don't know what, is,
sd	And, you know, you can go to like a flea market and stuff
sd	and then on weekends they go out and sell it
aa	Right .
aa	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Okay.
ft	Thanks.
b	Okay.
ad	do you want to go ahead and start?
qy	Well, you like classical music?
sd	I like classical music.
sd	I like country and western .
sd	I like all kinds .
qy^d	you don't like country?
sd	the kind of country I like is kind of the older country music. not the kind like Kenny Rodgers and stuff like that.
sv	that's a little bit to,
sd	like Hank Williams.
sv	this stuff, makes you cry it sounds so sad .
ny	Yeah.
aa	Yes.
b^m	Yeah.
sd	And I can barely watch anymore because, they have this heavy metal stuff on there
sd	and I liked, Aerosmith and Led Zepplin and, you know, and, jeez who else is there. Van Halen.
sd	Now I like groups like that.
sd	But, some of these groups now like Slaughter .
sv	Some of them are just really rough.
b	Okay.
b	I see.
bk	Okay .
qw	Well, how old are you?
bk	Okay.
bk	okay.
sd	I'm, twenty eight .
b	rea ,
b	I see.
sd	My parents were very musical.
sd	My father likes, country western music.
sd	He's from, West Virginia.
sd	And he's always liked it
sd	so he likes that.
sd	She always had these old Doris Day records and stuff like that, though.
sd	So, you know, I grew up listening to that stuff.
sv	But, you know, I could see why you were kind of sheltered I guess from music.
b	okay.
b	okay.
sd	THIS LOVE CUTS LIKE A KNIFE. SUMMER OF SIXTY NINE.
b	Yeah.
sd	he's from Canada.
^2	The titles and artists.
qr	Well, do do you watch music television, M T V at all? Or V H One?
bk	Okay.
b	Oh,
sd	you have to get cable to get those stations anyhow.
b	But, yeah.
sd	I like watching that kind of thing.
nn	No,
b	really.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	We have a very detailed budget. Because my husband is a finance major.
sd	And you know, we have money that we take out each month you know, for food and for gas and things like that.
sd	Then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year
sd	And so, the things like a vacation.
sd	and we're continually putting into those, you know, each month how much we're going to need
sd	So we very rarely buy anything on credit.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	If we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here.
sd	And we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays, that we want to put in for, the vacation. That we put in for Christmas.
h	Well, a lot of that, I don't know how safe it is.
sd	And so it's actually pulled out.
sd	we have a savings account for the kids' education.
sd	we have three children.
sd	That money is put into each month.
no	He does somewhat.
sd	we have an investment plan.
sd	But, we have really found,
sd	Christmas, birthdays, car maintenance, dental, medical,
sd	and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance doesn't cover rather than wondering where it's going to come from,
sd	we have it, you know.
sd	And when we see something on sale, instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we've got enough and getting it, and then when something comes up, you know, kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill. Everything's taken care of.
sd	And we're finding that we even have more money than we thought.
ny	Yeah .
na	I do.
sd	All the money is turned over to me.
ny	Yes.
sd	And so then that can go, you know, either back into our checking account
sd	you know, there are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months. And certain times when that will be left over.
sd	But that's completely up to me how I do that.
sd	And so it's kind of my money
sd	We have a clothing, envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing.
sv	It really works out great.
ny	Yes.
sd	And also, we need a new bed.
sd	And if we find one on sale before then, then we can just take that and put it towards ,
sv	I would say the medical, group insurance area as far as, covering medical costs for yourself or family members.
ny	Yeah,
sd	so it's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing,
sd	But overall, I've been pleased with it over the years.
sv	I think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year, our district has had to you know, change companies,
qo	How about yourself?
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right,
sd	and, I did have surgery last summer
sd	But, again, I was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I'm sure it would be very stressful
sd	but your benefits are not as, you know, good,
b	all right.
aa	I do too.
b^m	Right.
aa	Right.
sv	It is just, Texas has really, you know,
qw	What do you do there?
bk	Okay.
ba	Well, that's good.
sv	and, it's good that they allow you that.
sd	as I say, the schools,
sd	That's the only reason I work there, is that my children now have and graduated from college
sd	and, I've just continued to, stay there .
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sd	But, they have done some testing around our office, mostly after lunch, looking for people drinking beer and stuff at lunch time,
br	Pardon?
ny	Yeah,
ar	No,
b	Yeah,
sd	I'm in the oil business.
aa	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh,
sv	Well, that sounds like kind of an important job to be, straight on.
aa	Yeah,
sd	as long as it's not abused, you know, random, you know,
^h	Well, see, this is it,
sd	But if they catch you, if you test positive for a controlled substance, then you get fired.
sv	So, you know, it's sort of one of these little catch twenty twos.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	But, when you're a private company, the rules don't always apply.
no	Well, it's hard for me to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment
sv	so you know, I guess it works, much well, shoot, like any lottery,
sv	So, I'd rather have that than, you know, say well, this week the A s and B s are going to be in
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
sd	You know, I've gone out and had a beer at lunch time, but not to excess in any case .
no	I don't remember, to tell you the truth.
sv	Well, you know, you can take some of that testing a little bit too far.
sd	it was, it was an unannounced sweep of,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
^2	Well, they're going to be getting there.
b	Yeah.
sd	And I have three granddaughters right now.
sd	one's in Iowa.
sd	And, she's a teacher
sd	and they let her bring her little daughter in for free.
sd	but she just works part time.
sd	Then I have another daughter in, Bountiful, Utah
sd	And, the baby just screams.
sd	Well even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there.
sd	and then I have a seven month old granddaughter
sd	They live with us
sd	She said it's so awful.
sv	I'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere.
sv	But it's really, really very difficult
sd	the see first ten or twelve years, I stayed home.
sd	And, then after that I went to work.
sd	And, a couple of times I just, you know,
sd	I mean, first of all, her children were sick all the time.
sd	same thing that her kids had,
sd	And so, we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock.
sd	And then what happened is, you know, they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby sitter.
sd	I was so furious.
aa	Yeah,
na	Actually, they just recently started a policy of testing drugs, which was kind of interesting,
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
^h	Well, it's actually,
sd	Other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that,
b	Yeah .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	but, I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job where I had to, do a drug test
sv	and the, the procedure is utterly humiliating.
ba	Well, that sounds good.
sd	I've heard the name
b	Yeah.
sv	you know, they don't always have their full wits about them.
sv	They're not completely up on what should be going on or what's not going on.
sv	And it can be pretty sad.
sd	And, you know, it's the type of thing that she was living down in Florida.
sd	and the other part of her family was up in, New York state.
sd	And, you know, it was very difficult for either them or my grandfather to take care of her since she you know, could not do very much for herself after the stroke.
sv	And, you know, the nursing home was the, you know, best facility to put her in. You know, besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work
sv	and both my, aunts and uncle work. Which means it's, you know, very difficult for some ,
sv	you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full time.
sv	And, you know, there's also a lot of medical problems that can't always be completely handled in the home. Which makes it, you know,
sv	it's a necessary evil I think.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Either that or they're just so understaffed that they can't afford to put in the, care that they need. Cause it's, you know,
sd	an elderly person can, you know,
b	Uh huh.
sv	And it, very, very hard for them to accept that.
no	More of a retirement home.
sd	And they provide one meal a day.
sd	And, you know, the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him.
sd	But they do have, you know, group activities going on.
sd	he'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in Florida.
sd	you know, to move into that facility we moved him from Florida up to Maryland
na	Well there was stuff like that in Florida
sv	Oh, boy, probably, robberies, people stealing from each other.
qy^h	Is that what happens up there a lot?
aa	well, yeah,
sd	I break that law every day .
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I've been caught with marijuana before,
aa	No,
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sv	Well for a lot of the kind of premeditated murders, I think the death penalty is,
sv	they have that down here in Florida still.
qy	do they?
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	Then, you know, there's been guys in jail for six years
b	Right.
b	yeah,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	And they're kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right,
aa	No,
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
na^r	Okay .
ny	Yeah.
qw	What d ,
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	That's hard for me to say since I didn't, I didn't really grow,
sv	So I guess I can't really I can't say what it would be like to, grow up in a really oppressed region .
sv	You know, I guess the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people.
sv	So, I guess the thing to do is to try to get some kind of motivation to learn
b	Uh huh.
b	No,
b	Yeah.
sd	If you compare like the people that could have sent their kids to private schools and you know, the people that, did send their kids to private schools.
sv	I think they compare you know, fairly well.
b	Yeah.
sv	I mean, that makes a big difference
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
qy	Do you think, then, that, the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	One of the things that I found interesting last year during the Gulf conflict was a sentiment against, Peter Arnett, who had stayed in Iraq and was presenting, some of the things that were available.
^h	I've heard some about Saturns.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
^h	Well, let's see.
sd	And I found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in, finding a car anymore that's fairly easy for me to work on, it's not very,
ba	Ooh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well I've got an eighty three Saab.
sv	And I find that for you know, everyday things. It's really very easy to work on
sd	With a three fifty in it.
sd	And, I really liked working on it. cause it was pretty easy too.
sv	And that's, that's probably one thing I'd look at.
b	Huh.
sd	I've driven some, Tauruses over the last couple of years when I've been on business trips. as rental cars.
sd	And I've always been very impressed with the Taurus.
sd	I've been real impressed with that.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think that, That's excellent.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay .
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
sd	and I finally was.
sd	it was, it was, well, let's see, it was municipal court
sd	so it was a combination of,
sd	so it was a combination of criminal and civil,
sv	and then, it was always exciting when we got called to, to go, because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides, just sit in the jury room.
ny	yeah,
sd	Course they don't have to give a reason,
sv	they want to get the best, mix for their case,
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
^h	Well, I was never there for any sentencing.
aa	Yeah.
sd	I, I wanted to vote guilty for the guy,
sd	so, the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again.
sd	it must have been six.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	it was too circumstantial?
b	okay.
b	Okay,
sd	If you don't want to, you know, talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it .
na^m	Right.
ny	Yep.
sv	So, so I think that a short work week is real nice.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah .
sd	Well, well, I do research in computer science
sd	what I really like is, I like being,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	I watch the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour,
sd	I'm in Dallas.
qy	Are you in Dallas also?
b	really,
b	Uh huh.
bh	really.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but, I would always end up arriving at work late, because I would always end up skimming the headlines, spending too much time, reading it in the morning.
sd	So I have to cut myself down to the weekend, plus after work.
sd	and I enjoy that quite a bit.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I will admit I work with, someone who's Iranian,
sd	He's very, very skeptical of the news media,
b	Uh huh.
sd	They, tend to spend quite a bit of time on one story.
sd	They will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time.
sd	Well, I guess they only normally stick with just the one, story.
aa	No,
sd	A lot of times they end up, with these panels of experts
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
aa	I will admit it's interesting.
sv	And they seemed to mold the events to their view of the world, which I suppose just about everyone does,
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sv	I thought that was a really unusual thing.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's true.
sv	And probably more importantly, one that lasted short enough that people's interest didn't flag too badly.
sd	I will admit the same thing.
sd	and I was just, I was horrified and fascinated by what I was seeing.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	so I'm pretty much limited to P B S, which I thought they did a very good job.
sd	I've got one question for you.
sv	I found the newspaper situation in Dallas very interesting.
qy	Does San Antonio ha ,
qy	Do you have just one paper,
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	I actually take both newspapers on the weekends.
sd	I figure I'm only taking on the weekend,
sd	I find the news reporting in the MORNING NEWS to be better,
sd	I get the TIMES HERALD just to balance that out a little bit.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm relatively satisfied with the benefits I have.
sd	I'd rather that we got a bit more coverage for a lot less money.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	I have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered
sd	And so recently, when we had a claim, they didn't pay the eighty five percent they paid much lower
b	Yeah,
sv	But it's difficult.
qy^d	Well, you have vacation, I mea ,
b	Huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	And, you know, the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay, perhaps or, um, I don't know, I suppose, sick days.
sd	ours is based on number of days,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but, you know I suppose some places are more stringent about that than others.
sv	and, maybe arriving late or something like that, you know,
sd	But other than that I don't have much feeling for the benefits,
b	Uh huh.
sd;qy^d	I didn't know that somebody could avoid workmen's compensation.
bk	I see.
b	Uh huh,
sv	and at least, you know, financially in the short run,
sv	I mean, sure, the payroll is lower that way,
b	Uh huh,
aa	That's right.
fc	Well thank you for calling.
fc	Bye bye.
ny	Yeah,
sd	Plus, we're in what's called the Finger Lake Region of New York
nn	No,
sd	You know, all sorts of fun stuff like that.
sd	So it's, that's, a lot of fun.
qo	How about you?
b	Yeah.
sd	We have, some friends who live on the lake
sv	and, the lake it just seems, is completely filled with bass to the point where, you know, normally you y , y , go fishing for bass, you get a lot of sunfish, or cat or whatever, and some other strange stuff. / * listen
aa	Yeah,
sd	probably during perch season the perch will run in very large schools,
sd	and when they do, you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one at,
sd	according to them, when the perch are running, you can catch them on just about anything.
sd	They tend to use, I guess worms or some kind of lures sometimes,
sd	corn or salami or bread or anything,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
ba	Wow.
qy	A big one?
ba	that's, that's a nice size carp.
b	Uh huh.
bf	that, that counts.
qy	do you, do you actually like the taste of f ,
b	Right,
aa	Right.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	so he'd maneuver us into a school of fish
sd	it was a, like twenty dollars for six hours of fishing on some big charter boat.
sd	You know, and, and they'll clean your fish on a tip basis for you if you want.
sd	this, this was for a, you know, large,
sd	we weren't all related, just, you know, thirty people off the shop in the boat there.
sd	If you want to go on a boat alone, it's like two hundred dollars a day.
sd	But this is great, because I think it was nineteen dollars for five hours and twenty dollars for six hours or something.
sd	so you'd get to go out there for, for six hours and get a nice suntan and bring along some lunch and fish all day.
sv	I think we're probably close, though.
fc	Nice talking to you, too.
fc	Bye bye.
sv	Well, I think our tastes are fairly similar,
sd	I suppose, I could get away with extremely casual clothes,
sd	and, I guess dress it up with a, a very nice black jacket when I have visitors or have to give talks.
b	Right.
nn	No,
nn	But, no,
sd	But but, you know, you wear a heavy sweater in your office, all summer.
sd	I don't, I, you know, I'm not a clothes horse in the sense that some of my friends.
sd	And I guess although in, as I recall the stereotype of secretaries was, you know, overdress, over kill, sort of
sd	and in a sense, the people I know who spend the most on clothes are secretaries.
sv	Although the fact that most of the ones I know are in the government and they're not meeting the public I find it a little bit strange that their priorities would be to spend this money here .
o	You know,
sv	I mean, I suppose if you were a, more a receptionist and meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake perhaps you would have to dress up.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
sd	I'm really glad about that pant suits are popular because I'm allergic to many of the synthetics.
sd	And so I used to have a problem when I was working in a restaurant while I was in college and had to dress up, and nylons and things like that would just give me a terrible rash.
o@	So, Right,
aa^r	right.
fc	Okay.
fc	Well, have a good day.
fc	Bye bye.
ny	Yes,
sd	I'm a nurse,
sd	drives her to school,
sd	Well, I could do it now.

aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I would, too, because even though a place can look pretty good on the outside, we're finding out now that it's not always on the inside
sd	and I just don't know what I would do if I had to do that.
sd	I know the hospital that I work in is a big hospital

ba	They do.
b	Yeah,

sd	Well, she lives in Utah,
b	Yeah.
aa	Okay,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Okay.
sd	I stay home most of the time
sd	my neighbor she tends children though
sv	And, you know, there's pros and cons on both side of that
sd	because if they were, then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing, or some kind of something to , get an okay seal.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	He's almost a teenager .
aa	Yeah,
sd	and they did a good job, for me.
sd	but I've never had to leave them like in a day care center, or anything,

b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
ba	Well, some people aren't.
b	Yeah.

sd	Well, nannies have been an option,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.

aa	Yeah.
sv	I think so, because if they were still there, you know they might not,
aa	Right,
aa	You can't really.
sd	and usually they aren't at that age.
sd	Well, I know about three years ago I, I tended some children. And, you know, I wondered if I would have to be certified
sd	or whether they'd just bring them
sd	and so, they said, no, don't do that, we'll just bring them.
sd	And then if there was a problem
sd	but it never happened, to be a problem,
sd	and so things worked out okay,
b	Oh.
ba	That's great.
b	uh huh.
ba	Well, that will be great.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
ba	Sure,
sv@	and you know, the grandparents, I always hear it's always fun when you can send them home at the end of the day instead of having to, * slash error So, * slash error That's right.
sd	Well, my husband's mother lives right over here,

sd	and I've always appreciated when she's sat with them.
b	Oh .
aa	Sure.
nn	No.
ng	we try not to.
sd	We're on a pretty strict and tight budget.
sd	We use the credit cards, however, when we're at a situation where we don't have either the cash or the checkbook handy.
sd	Or we use credit cards also, if we want to get an extended warranty on an item that we're purchasing.
sd	and basically we use it mainly when we're traveling or out of state or or somewhere where, you know, they don't take out of state checks
sd	and so when we're traveling some.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah,
sd	and they just pay the minimum required balance.
aa	Yes,
sd	some people I know also try to use it as float where they buy something now
sd(^q)	and say, well, I'm going to buy this when it's good and on sale
^q	when I'm being paid.
aa	That's true.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
qy	Are they the same there?
ba	That's pretty steep.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh,
aa	Yes,
ba	Very good.
b	Uh huh.
b	Well, yeah,
sv	that you can can find yourselves in those situations and use a credit card to to help yourself.
sv	So I think that there's a great advantage to a credit card in those situations.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
sd	We like to use three, basic credit cards.
sd	That way we're not confused
qy	And, do you find that you get an awful lot of credit card applications through the mail?
sd	Once a week,
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
b	Yes,
qy^g^t	Well, this is about drug testing right?
sv	Well, I'm certainly under the influence of the idea that the government needs to have less control on what the citizens do,
sv	I think it should be more by the private institution.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Definitely,
sv	if it's a policeman and he's working with, the public and has a gun in his holster or even, you know, if it's a guy at McDonald's cooking a burger, I think, they're dangerous in either situation.

b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
sd	Well, I live out in the country,
sv	so that part is good.
sd	and right now in our area were fighting against a toxic waste incinerator. / * sp: we're
sd	And, it won't be too for from where we live. / * sp: far
sd	we would like the, industry to do more to take care of the waste products before they turn to incineration, because we feel that, the small percentage that they're going to be putting into the air is too much.
b	Huh uh.
sv	that has to be terrible over there.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh .
aa	No.
sd	they've reused some of it,
sd	and that they've shown, that to begin with, apparently it does cost more,
sd	but, once they get started, it saves them money in the end,
sd	that's what we want done.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
sv	They're making fantastic amounts on these things
ng	We've never been,
sd	we should have gone the whole way over,
sd	and she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw.
sd	She said they couldn't see those things out there, because of the smog and everything.
nn	No.
qy	Have you been there?
b	Oh.
nn	no,
sd	We're near Pittsburgh, Clarion University.
sd	it's kind of northwest part of Pennsylvania.

qy	Are you a young person?
b^m	Thirty one.
nn	No,
sd	older people,
sv	and they don't realize these things are going to affect everybody.
sv	Nieces, nephews, whatever, friends.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
sd	They say it has really made a difference, though.
sd	Now, see, we don't have that here, yet.
nn	No,
sd	I have read that, that it has really helped where where the population is greater,
sd	and that it has made a difference.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
^2	Something is coming out,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
sv	Then, we have to pay for them to pay somebody to carry it away someplace,
sv	And we're paying to have our air polluted and our water streams polluted.
sd	the one area they want to put the incinerator is right in the middle of the two water sheds that feed Clarion river.
sv	And, you know, it just boggles our mind that they can consider even putting it there, because, if that water gets contaminated, it will go on down to Pittsburgh.
sv	it affects so many people.
sv	And it's just hard to think that they could allow them to do things like this.
b	Huh uh.
aa	It really is.
fc	It is really a concern.
fc@	So, * slash error Huh uh.
fc	Huh uh.
fc	Bye.
bk	Good.

sv	and it's been very well done .
sd	then when our son's over, we have a pool,
sd	And, we do a lot with with our kids,
sd	We've taken a lot of trips with our kids when they were younger.
sd	and the kids seem to enjoy being with us,
na	Well, it does .
sd	and they go out to you know, the in laws in between some of this,
sd	then have Christmas dinner with us and then go to other in laws and things,
sd	and my sister and her husband are coming down,
aa	Yeah.
sv	I think the trends are going back to spending more time with families.
sv	I think parents are definitely, spending more and more time.
sv	Seems like it went through a spell there where families weren't that big a deal.
b	uh huh.
sd	Well, we really like the Mexican food, you know, here in Texas

b^m	Salad bar,
sd	I've lost track.
b	 okay ,
sd	My wife when she talked about the Middle East
sv	out of all the Asians we brought in, there's a tremendous criminal element that we let in from Asia
sd	I mean this Asia mafia thing is getting out of hand.
sd	I don't, I didn't know what, I don't even know what our controls are.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
^2	Because we,
sd	I'm sympathetic,

sd	the Mexican kids get a good education along the way,
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	of course you mentioned the language.
sv	so that we wouldn't have the language barrier certainly.
sd	and I feel bad about that .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sv	That certainly was interesting,
sv	So we all immigrants, one way or another, well
aa	yeah,
b	Yeah,
sv	sometimes common sense should take over rather than,
sv	You would think they could at least get a, a visa or something until they, get citizenship.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	no.
sd	I don't know how much immigration we have from Europe and everything.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	well yeah.
sd	well it's still interesting after all this time that we're probably one of the few countries that people are still desperately trying to immigrate to.
sv	maybe immigration from Europe to here will you know slowly, change,
sv	It has, doesn't seem so far.
b	Uh huh.

sd	I just file federal income tax every year.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	Whoever works less, they can get a tax credit for that.
sd	If both of the spouses work, then you get a tax credit for that.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, it's two thousand now.
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Then you get a child care exemption,

sv	You know, it's not even,
fc	okay.
fc	Nice talking to you.

sd	Even some of that I like okay but not, mostly, as a general rule,
sd	I don't care for that at all.
sd	Well, as far as the rap goes, I think there are a few artists that appeal to me themselves
sd	and I like some of their songs.
sd	I agree, with the general rule, I wouldn't choose rap either.
sd	But I like to listen to, what you might call pop, easy listening country western, jazz classical,
sd	I like, like I said, pretty varied, music.
sd	I have a couple that my husband really hates that I listen to, like Billy Holiday
sd	I really love to listen to her,

fc	It was good talking to you too.
fc	Yeah.
fc	It's amazing how the, you know, people you talk to have some interesting conversations
fc	Yeah,
fc	Yep.
b	Uh huh.
qo	How do you feel about them, I mean, since you've kind of been close to that.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, she put him in,
sd	but, I guess, the one time that I saw him there, you know, as far as the surroundings, that seemed okay.
sd	But, we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of, you know keep him real out of it all the time
sd	and that's always kind of bothered me.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I have a sister in law who runs a nursing home,
sd	and I know that she's the kind of person who wouldn't allow, you know, a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about.
sv	But still I'm sure there are, you know, aspects to it that aren't really desirable.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, sometimes you don't have any other alternative
sv	family and friends are usually, well family's tied up with their own lives and things, and usually working
aa	Yes.
aa	Yes.
sd	But then if you deteriorate, they have a separate section for those who need care you know, all the time.
sd	and they have a long waiting list, too.
sv	but then, you don't want to go do that when you don't have to because like, you have to give up your automobile or whatever.
b	Yeah
sv	So that's a hard one,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sv	and, another thing I hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money, and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately.
sv	But those who don't have money can go in and get the same care. You know .
sd	So I don't like that aspect.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
b	Well, yeah,
qh	But, you know, what if.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	Some of those places have wonderful activities and things, you know, lots of stuff going on.
sd	And they'll take them places
h	so. I don't know,
sv	but I guess once you get ill, then, you know, you really have some problems if you can't get around and do things.
b	No.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	That might be kind of tough,
fc	Okay.
fc	Bye.
sd	we, we have a terrible air pollution problem.
sd	Our summers are extremely, hazardous
sd	and during, certain wind directions because we get the, Gary, Indiana Chicago pollution
sd	and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze, coming up along the lake.
sd	And they do post, warnings for people who have, heart diseases or respiratory problems during that summer season.
sd	In the winter it's not as severe.
sd	But, if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad.
sd	the State of Wisconsin, as a matter of fact, started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting.
sv	I don't think it's going to go very far,
qw	So what's the conditions like in Dallas?
sd	Wisconsin has a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag and they are tested for, their pollution control equipment,
sd	and if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it is drivable.
sd	you know, there seem to be, at least in certain little pockets,
sd	Madison has one of the nicest, bike, road, sharing programs of any city in Wisconsin
sd	and all Wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of, bike trails for recreational use of any of the states.
sd	And there is a real promotion of biking
sd	but, there are still a lot of people who insist on driving their own automobiles to go everywhere.
sv	I find that a little irritating, because I don't think it's always so necessary.
ad	send them to Wisconsin,
sv	and they'll, they may wake up, you know,
sv	It's, really a serious issue for those of us up in this, sector up here.
sv	I think it's mostly vehicles although it does come from some of the industry of the Gary area
sd@	and, I don't know exactly where it emerges from when it's up in the, northern sectors of Wisconsin / * slash error with b.70: one utt
sd	That I'm a little uncertain of,
aa	Yes.
^h	Well, let's see,
br	Excuse me.
nn	No,
b	yeah.
ba	well, let's hope that you aren't employed by that craft for too long.
b	Uh huh.
qw	what kind of time frame is it, looking for the, different shifts up there?
sd	basically, I had read that they're just looking at relocating them all to McKinney is it, Texas,
ba	wow.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow,
bh	How about that.
qy	Is it, many other corporations in the area?
qy^g	I think it went to Lockheed, didn't it?
sd	I hear they're hiring all over the place for that.
bh	really?
bh	How about that.
b	Uh huh.
qr	Well, you in the, computer operations or in the actual, manufacturing?
b	Right,
qy	Am I still employed by T I,
sd	Actually, December was my first month away from them.
sd	Exempt.
sd	unfortunately I guess for myself it wasn't, it was purely by my own choice.
nn	No.
ny	Yeah,
sd	but as an overall package, I'd say I'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It may be a blessing in disguise.
ba	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Sure.
b	Uh huh .

sd	I have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking things for granted she threatens to send him to Mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that for a while .

b	Yeah.

t3	I don't think so,
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
b	Uh huh.
sd^t	The first time I used to get calls from far away too.
sd^t	Like Maryland, and New Jersey,
sd^t	but now it just seems like it's in the Dallas Fort Worth area that I get calls from.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
aa	I agree.
fe	shoot.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
nn	No,
nn	No,
sd	My sister is,
sd	Our name is on the till,
sd	so that implies ownership.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
sd	Liked the area, chose to stay inside of Spring Park.
sd	So, there's a lot of, you know, activities, a lot of pluses and common land.
aa	Yeah.
sd	it bottom out about a year later.
aa	Oddly enough, two years, you know,
sd	not in, this area.
b	Yeah.
nn	No,
sd	It's, Richardson
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	I don't think that many by the builder that built this house.
sd	It was built by the architect for himself, who never moved into it. Who sold it to a couple who had no idea that homes ever needed upkeep.
ba	yeah,
sd	So, they just watched the water pour in on the carpet.
sd	He builds eight hundred thousand dollar houses now.
b	Yeah,
sd	And I think somebody told me it's also on a creek side lot, heavily wooded off the golf course.
b	Yeah,
ar	I think it was sixty, eighty.
h	I think.
ad	Well, try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot .
sv	Just never.
qy	and, cause. Have you been back to the Perry Homes, back here?
sd	The one that looks like Monopoly apartments.
sd	They are huge when you are inside them.
sd	They are very spacious.
sv	See, when you have kids, you like to be able to, send them some place where they can yell and you won't hear them.
sd	But, I have been watching these houses go up
sv	When you watch them go up, you are just amazed that they do not fall over.
sd	And it takes them something like, thirty days to complete a house.
b	Uh huh.
sd	We have got three different levels of decking, because, this lot slopes way back down
sd	and, the house is built around the trees.
sd	And with these decking that a corporation and a large area for the trees to come up
sd	when the people from M C I come down
aa	Right,
sv	And, the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it, for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars, which is probably about what their equity is, that they got out of selling their house.
sd	Because those things are selling like hot cakes.
sd	and he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here.
sd	it's because there's no insulation in those things.
b	Yeah.
sd	they show very well un , they show very well unless you have, you know, lived in a lot of houses around the area, or looked at a lot of houses around here.
sv	And I think that makes a big difference.
sv	I think if we had to sell now, we could come close to breaking even .
ny	Yes,
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's true,
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
ba	gosh.
b	Yeah,
aa	I know,
fe	goodness,
b^m	Pretty close.
fc	Well it was nice talking to you too Jim.
fc	Okay,
b	Yeah.
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
sv	Normally we don't have too much, humidity or, rainy time when it's past June.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Well, yeah,
sv	and, you know, so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities, you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather.
sd	You know, and here it was like, pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime
sv	You could pretty much do whatever you wanted to do.
qw	What part of Michigan were you living in?
bk	Okay.
qw	What brought you down here?
qy	So you teach in Plano schools?
b	Oh.
bk	Okay.
b	Well, yeah,
sd	You know, the little joke about, will the last person leaving Michigan just turn out the light .
sd	Well, you know, I said I lived in, the Pontiac.
sd	I lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes.
sd	You know, like maybe a mile, two long.
sv	That's enough to, do some boating
sd	and it was lots of fun.
b	Uh huh.
sd	We had, Pine Knob you know, to go skiing and stuff.
sd	So there were things around there.
na	Right,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	You know, because they were from Alabama where it never snowed
sd	and they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it, you know, eternally.
sd	My first winter here,
sd	And I remember getting up and somebody telling me, hey, better wait to go to work because the roads are all, you know, snow .
sd	it just melted it all away.
sv	Course, when we get an ice storm, that's not too much fun.
b	Yeah.
aa	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	yeah
b	Huh uh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	It was Dukakis,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it wou , it would help unemployment greatly.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	really,
bk	Right,
sd	I had you know, the required political science class a couple of years ago.
sd	And one of the things we discussed was, you know, where the budget situate , how the budget situation just got so out of hand.
sd	I think it was like in the, tax year of eighty one,
sd	and Congress, realizing that they were going to lose a, the Democratic Congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war, you know, you know, bye bye removing the tax cut further cut the taxes and that, that, you know, created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit.
sv	I mean, it's just like they're playing chicken with a loaded gun.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I mean, it's kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing, you know where people just want to have, you know, whatever will make them feel good, right now, you know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I just don't think it was a well thought out incentive.
fp	I'm Jay in Dallas.
bf	That keeps you plenty of exercise .
sd	I walked and run almost every morning.
ba	that would,
ba	All right.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think you feel better, too, if you get on some program like that,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Oh.
sv	and, especially when somebody's, planning lunch for you and they know what's good for you,
fc	thank you for calling.
fc	All right.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	The latest movie I've seen that I thought was fantastic was DANCES WITH WOLVES.
ba	man.
sd	So I finally just went to see it.
b	Yeah.
sv	the buffalo scene in that thing was so real.
sd	I mean it just blew me away.
b	Yeah.
sd	It's supposed to be good though.
sd	I know some friends who went to see it.
sd	They said it was really riveting.
sv	Well, you're not a thirteen year old.
b	uh huh.
b	really.
ba	boy.
ba	Gosh.
ba	gosh.
sd	I saw one I thought was crummy.
aa	I know.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	boy.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I hadn't read it
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
ba	Wow.
sd	Well, I have one I bet you haven't seen if you don't have kids. OTIS AND MILO.
sd	that is the most precious movie.
sd	and all the other animals.
b	Yeah.
sd	But there's you know, nothing else to keep it going.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	boy.
ba	That's pretty good.
^h	Let's see.
sd	That is a riot.
ny	Yeah.
nd	No,
sv	It's hard to find movies that aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
bh	You don't?
sd	my husband does that.
sd	there's very few I would want to see that many times.
aa	yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	boy.
b	Uh huh.
ba	gosh.
b	Yeah,
ba	Gosh.
ba	boy.
ba	really .
sd	and it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it
sd	The ceilings were so short.
b	Yeah.
ba	boy.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
qy	Did you see any movies over there ?
b	Yeah.
ba	boy .
b	Uh huh.
ba	boy.
b	Yeah.
ba	That sounds great.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh
ba	boy.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Because sometimes the reviews you just can't go by.
b	Yeah.
ba	I see .
sv	Water view .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qo	Well what are the others?
ba	Well it's helpful.
qy	Well do you keep up with the statistical stuff?
sd	Well there's a guy that was on show that I listen to going to work in the morning who does,
sd	it's essentially trivial statistics
sd	it's a statistic that has to do with winning and losing one run games.
sd	And apparently the Rangers last year, won a lot of one run games.
aa	Well, it, it is
qw	gee, how can you draw a conclusion from it,
sv	And, strangely enough, it's almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year.
h	I don't know,
sv	Well it's an interesting concept, though, when you look at, of how apparently,
sd	and he could go in the team the next day,
sv	and all he has to do is hit the ball,
sv	It's an interesting concept of how they do it.
aa	Yes.
b	Yeah,
qy	Well are they going to beat Oakland?
b	Yeah.
qy	did you actually live in Saint Louis?
qy^g	everybody does, right.
sd	I had a friend from college that lives in,
sd	out that way,
qy	Well is that a good indicator?
sv	it seems that what you really need to do to win though, is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have, have real breakthrough years.
sv	and the question is how do you forecast that,
sv	if you had to bet on who would be in the World Series, I mean it would be really tough.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qw	well when are the Rangers going to come through th ,
sd	Well is there enough money,
qy^d	I don't know if you read Skip Bayless, a local commentary
sd	and, his argument is that the ownership is not inclined to lose big money long enough to bring in the big dollars.
qy	would you agree with that?
b	Yeah.
qy	Well didn't Kansas City put up quite a bit of money for their pitching staff .
b	Yeah.
sv	Well and I think that's maybe part of it that the,
sv	Well it, it, yeah, it's a little bit like any other sport, you know.
sd	if you, if you compare to go to a sport, a
qh	but how often do you do that.
sv	I, I would, I would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there, you know, several times a,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
no	well, I am a school teacher.
sd	there is, girl that went through our school district, I teach in Highland Park who, does aerobics at the Y C A and I say Y, the Y W C A
t3	turn that off please,
sd	Any way, she comes to the school
sd	and we do it twice a week.
sd	And, we do, aerobics, for our cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes
sd	So it is an hour.
sd	And, not on the nights that I do aerobics,
sd	And so, we, take it seriously.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I understand that.
sd	Well, and too. I just make myself.
sd	I get up at five thirty
sd	School is not over until, four
sd	and our class,
sd	that is the big difference
sd	And I just go
sd	and I have done that before, but it has always had to be late at night after I have got home and after dinner
sv	and you are just kind of going Ugh.
aa	It is.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I have twenty five minutes for lunch.
sd	That is out for me.
aa	No,
sd	and they are nice because if we are running late, it usually,
sv	and, it does going to start whether you are there or not .
sd	So this has worked out real nicely.
aa	Huh uh.
sd	and so it is like twenty four dollars every six weeks.
aa	Huh uh.
ba	You are not kidding.
aa	I know.
sd	I mean, we were paying a hundred dollars plus month for our family membership
sd	and at first we used it
sd	And they offered lots of things,
sd	So we decided to forget that.
sd	That was just a waste of our our money.
ba	no.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It does make you feel better.
sv	And if you have somebody who will do it with you,
sd	but he decided that, maybe, you know,
b	Yeah,
sv	And this time President Bush did it through action
sv	or, I mean, he left almost no alternative.
sv	and it was very interesting how he did it
sv	I mean I think it's great that all the support.
sd	this is a B fifty two base where I work,
sd	and they're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it.
aa	Yes
b	Yeah,
sv	gosh this whole thing now with all the political cartoons on the Democrats and how they're, they're in a sad way for ninety two now in terms of the presidential election, anyway.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Right,
sv	everyone was discussing whether we should, wait longer,
sv	and, we were worried that they were getting dug in
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right,
sv	and not the Israelis but the Arabs all of a sudden are cheering for Baker on his drive to reconcile relations with the Israelis,
b	Yeah
nn	No,
sd	because I used to live in, Massachusetts,
aa	Yeah,
ba	my gosh.
sv	I'd certainly, support Israel in their policy in defending themselves and in their handling of their foreign policy,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Right.
aa	Yeah,
b	I,
sd	I'm, I'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months,
aa	Yeah,
sd	And I mean that's never happened before,
sv	and I don't know if it will ever happen again
fc	Yeah,
fc	All right.
fc	Bye, bye.
b	Okay.
aa	No.
aa	Yeah,
qr	are you talking, outside or inside?
b^m	Exterior,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, when we've painted,
sd	so there isn't as much wood that has to be painted.
sd	you've got to prepare it well
ba	Wow. that's quite a range.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
nn	No,
sd	and we have some more that need to be done,
sd	but the problem that we've owned this house almost five years now,
sd	when we took the masking tape off half the painted came with it.
sd	Big long strips.
aa	Yeah,
ar	well, no
sd	but, it had not,
sd	it comes off in strips, I mean not even little bit.
sd	we know what a job it's going to be
fc	Okay .

b	Uh huh,
ba	Hey,
b	Uh huh,
sd	I saw the one clip of him
sv	That was rather, gross .
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh,
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
^2	The styles,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	actually have been to the movies,
sd	very suspenseful.
aa	I really don't either,
ny	Yeah.
sd	it's not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful.
ar	No,
sd	And that I couldn't watch,
sd	that was so that he couldn't leave her,
aa	Yeah,
b	yeah,
sd	you know, and, and she feel madly in love with this writer.
sd	but she was a killer,
sd	but no one knew that.
sd	we just haven't had the time to go to the movies lately,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right,
sv	that looks good.
b	Yeah,
b	Really.
b	Really.
sd	I liked that movie.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
fc	Okay,
fc	Bye bye.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I work at T I
sd	and when it's raining, I'm more likely to wear jeans
sd	but it just really depends on the weather and my mood
b	Uh huh.
sd	There are a few people every now and then that wear those to work.
sd	for me I just, wouldn't want to do that.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
b	Right .
 b	Uh huh.
sd	And, to me I just wouldn't feel comfortable in that at work,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right .
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	you don't want to over do it but, just a little, a touch of it just to say, yes, I am a woman,
sd	but I can be professional too.
aa	Right,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right,
sd	The only real restrictions they have are, no halter tops and no shorts, even the long walking short of the squirts, the split skirts, anything that could be considered shorts they don't allow.
sd	And they don't allow, any sweat shirts or t shirts that might have vulgar, or, you know, anything like that on it,
sv	and I think that's good because it does allow people to be individual
sv	Or, you know, if you want to be comfortable and casual you can,
sv	and, you know, like when I'm writing training material, I prefer to be more comfortable unless I know I have to meet with a customer later during the day.
sv	So, I think, that is good that they're like that.
sv	and I don't quite agree with that.
aa	Right.
b	right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right,
fc	Nice talking to you too,
fc	Bye, bye.
na^t	That's it.
qr	what kind do you subscribe to or do you?
sd	I, take a computer magazine. And, also, BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS.
sd	And my pet peeve with magazines is all the little cards inside. And the cardboard pages .
aa	Well, that's true.
sd	And I haven't bought a REDBOOK in a while ,
sd	I really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore .
ny	Yeah .
b	Right .
aa	Mine, too .

sd	And that's one thing I don't like about PEOPLE.
aa	No,
nn	, no,
sd	And, I'm a real movie buff,
sd	And, my mother is the reason I get, the HOME JOURNAL and the, computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me.
sd	Otherwise, if I really want to take the time to read a magazine and I see one on the grocery shelf, I'll pick it up then. Rather than having them delivered and think, I really need to read this .
b	Yeah,
sd	Well, I do like recipes and crafts.
aa	That's true.

aa	And, yes,
arp	well, n , Not just for dealing in drugs.
sd	There are certain circumstances,
aa	yes.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yes,
sd	I think that's the way it's worded.

sd	But I thought it was in effect.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	it does.
aa	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
aa	Yes,
sd	Well, Well, when I was still smoking, I felt that way.
sd	but, now the shoe's on the other foot .
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
sd	Well, the, there's a trick I use.
sd	And every time I wanted one I have to go outside and just take one. One at a time.

b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sd	And, my husband is a Vietnam veteran
b	Right.
aa	That's right,
b	Right.
b	Right.
sv	And I have a feeling that the Persian Gulf crisis is going to be the same way.
sv	I think we're going to end up back there in a few years if not sooner.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I think it would too.
aa	No,
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	I mean, my, my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries
aa	That's right.
sd	and that's what frustrates me more than anything.
b	Right.
sv	I think there's a lot of waste
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	And I guess, in, ironic way a lot of good came from the Vietnam war toward this war
aa	Right,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	And I just hate the emotional price a lot of the Vietnam people paid, for, you know, nothing.
sv	I mean, they're, they still don't know what they were there for.
aa	No.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right,
sv	I felt like they got way too much media coverage and publicity
sv	you have to support the people that are there.
sv	And for some reason those people don't see that.
aa	No,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	And I don't even know what they're doing for themselves. You know.
b	Yeah .
b	Yeah.
aa	That's true.
b	Uh huh,
nn	No,
aa	Yeah,
fc	Thanks,
fc	Bye bye.
o	Okay,
sd	She's actually at Bible College for this current year.
sv	And, I guess , first and foremost, really it's a question of what the student wants to have in the way of a career and then, which colleges or universities can best offer that program,
sd	it comes down to, trying to come with a trade off of the costs.
qo^d	what do you feel about come of the things that need to,
aa	No,
sv	It doesn't matter whether, you know, they're selling school.
o	and, true,
sv	I guess there's a difference in,
sd	you know, I know that there are a lot of colleges and universities, particularly as they get to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is, is right on campus as well
sv	and you know, that changes the character of it quite a bit.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	in competitions
sv	whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a spirit of, somewhat unkind, but producing graduates.
sv	you know, as sort of some development and some training,
sv	and that can vary between colleges, and faculties even, as to you know, what the attitude towards achievement is.
qy	do you, have anyone that you're seriously needing to, feed information to?
b	Right.
sd	going to university is going to take four to eight years depending on the pa , programs person's involved in
sv	and after that, you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself
sv	and if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market
fe	jeez,
aa	Right.
ba	that's interesting,
sv	Apparently they don't think it's a problem .
aa	That's right,
b	Oh.
bk	Right,
sv	I kind of feel the opposite, though.
sd	I wish we were given an opportunity to vote on more things.
sv	I think our elected officials say they are speaking for us
aa	That's true.
br	Is that true?
sd	I didn't know that,
sv	that's not really democratic. Not what I'd consider truly democratic.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	It's a duty, right.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	it's, that's, it's complex question when you start thinking about it, isn't it .
b	Uh huh.
sv	And I think they feel they can criticize if they don't .
sd	I told them if they don't vote they don't have the right to criticize.
aa	That's right,
aa	I think it is too.
sv	It doesn't really gain anything.
bk	I see.
b^m	Not,
sv	Well, maybe they should,
sv	and perhaps they would be indoctrinated that this is their duty.
sv	Maybe it should go with a drivers license .
sv	That is a privilege,
aa	It is.
sv	maybe it should be.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b^m	Don't have a great
nn	No,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	Sometimes I think we have that right now, with Congress.
sv	I think they're looking after their own self preservation more than they're actually looking after the good of the country.
b	Right.
sd	Well, like I told you before, .
sd	We put ours up.
sv	Well, you should try it.
b	Yeah.
qy	You lost your business?
ba	gol.
qy	Well, you weren't charging gold and silver were you?
qy	you can?
ba	that's a nightmare .
b	Uh huh.
sv	of course you fill them all out because you're honored.
sd	And, I had stuff for like Sanger Harris,
sv	Right.
sd	I wasn't thinking a thing about it.
aa	Yeah.
sv	Because, you know, get such good bargains.
h	And I don't know.
b	yeah,
sd	I went back to school and got my Master's,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bf	Turned out they weren't cheeky.
qw	So what is it now?
qw	What do you mean fifty five?
qw	But then, what's the interest?
qy^d	And interest is like eighteen or something.
aa	Yeah.
sd	You know, my parents don't hardly use them.
sd	I've got all my gas cards, because I don't want to carry money around.
sd	I'll do that.
sv	Now Impact is kind of bad too, though.
sd	You know. Especially if you forget to record those little suckers.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Of course, you got to charge it and keep your cash.
t3	What are you saying?
bf	Well, it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic.
bh^r	With cash?
aa	Yeah,
sv	But there's always a sale.
b	Yeah.
sd	What is that thing I saw,
sd^m	Circuit City.
qy	it's national?
sd	I think I've seen two around Dallas.
ny	Yeah,
ny	Uh huh.
qo^t	what else can we talk about?

bf	So it's sociology.
qy	So you're working on your doctorate?
ba	lord.
qy^g	that will sound wonderful, won't it?
sv	Get you a little plaque.
qy	aren't they laying off several thousand people?
sd	Well, I heard it on the news today,
qw	How much longer do you have?
ba	Ooh. / * listen
bf	Because you,
qo	Why?
sd	well we do have one in our home,
sd	However, you know, the bane of our existence these days,
ba	wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Exactly,
sd	But you do have to research that, find out what works for your system .
ba	well, that's a nice computer.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah .
sd	but, I also am sponsoring a literary magazine,
sv	So, it is wonderful,
sv	You have to make yourself do it,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh
b	Yeah.
aa	Right.
sv	if you're doing that sort of thing it's really useful,
ba	that's, fascinating.
sd	I knew what you meant,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	well .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	boy .
bh	What a change, huh?
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
ba	Well, that's good.
sd	Well, they vary tremendously.
aa	no,
sd	but, if, if you want to go into one that's really useful, you're going to have to go over a thousand dollars,
ny	yeah,
b	uh huh,
sd	but we've been able to do what we can.
aa	No,
b	yeah.
sd	And it's not quite as useful, not quite as powerful.
aa	They did,
bf	Sounds that you were right .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Right.
bk	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
fc	I need to go help my daughter do something,
fc	Good luck.
fc	bye bye.
na	Sure,
sd	, I like all kinds of books.
sd	Mostly, something, I like like true life, , you know, documentaries or real stories about real people and that kind of stuff or dramas in real life.
sd	And, I also like romantic novels.
sd	I usually read that from cover to cover.
sd	I like it because there's a little bit of everything in it.
o	You know, that kind of a thing.
sd	I wish I had in some senses
b	Uh huh.
ba	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
^h	jeez,
ny	You know , yeah,
sd	working a lot of hours at work
ny	Yeah,
sd	a lot time is spent doing things as far as the yard work or housework or, you know, that type of thing.
sd	But see I do crafts too,
sd	so it's hard,
aa	and that's like myself
sd	I really do
h	I don't know about you.
sd	if I'm really interested in what I'm reading, I mean, hours can go by
sd	In fact, I'd rather read sometimes than watch T V.
sv	But I think you get out of the habit, like you say,
nn	No.
b	Yeah,
sd	I'll stay up until two or three o'clock in the morning, you know, because I'm so engrossed in it
h	I don't know
h	I don't know what you would call it,
sv	It's terrible,
aa	yeah,
sd	I have a lot of craft books that I have too and, magazines.
sd	And, I like to, read about people who have been a successful, you know, who made a success of their lives.
sd	Like I say, haven't done it in such a long time.
no	well, I went to, seminar on,
sd	How he started out as just a salesman and now he's, you know, multimillionaire and that type of thing,
sd	it's not someone else,
sd@	And I find that fascinating that people, you know, can do that kind of thing. Just make up their minds that that's it. You know, have this one direction. / * more than one utt
aa^m	Do it.
sd	You know, kind of off the wall.
aa	I know,
ny	Yeah,
sv	That's funny,
aa	That's true,
ba	that's not bad.
ba	That's not bad at all.
qy	Do you like your job?
ba	that's, that's important.
qy	Do you have a family?
b	uh huh.
qy	Do you like it?
sd	I loved, I loved Abilene too.
sd	Except for tornados .
aa	Yes
ba	Unpredictable.
nn	no.
ba	wow.
ba	jeez.
ny	Yeah,
qy^d^m	And Colorado Springs?
ba	wow.
ba	Amazing.
ba	well, that's good.
sv	It's scary though I'm telling you.
h	I don't know,
sd	that books influence,
sv	I feel like it's important for young children to read too. And what you read to them.
sd	When my children were younger, of course,
sd	And, I think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also.
sd	I'm not saying they read all the right things
sv	because, even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens, I mean, they don't learn anything.
b	Yeah.
ba	it's unbelievable,
aa	Exactly,
sv	because, I think even mentally when you can do some,
bd	That's okay,
b	Okay.
b	Okay.
sd	You heard her in the background .
na	Takes a lot of time,
sd	little bit of embroidery work, once in a while.
qo	What do you like to do?
ba	Well, I'm sure you probably are.
sv	You like it,
aa	That's right.
ba	boy, that's hard sewing.
bf	Measure it and get it to,
ba	That's a lot of work.
b	Oh.
ba	That feels really good.
aa^m	To do it,
b^m	Keeping fish .
ba	no.
ba	no.
ba	you're kidding
b	I see.
ba	no.
bf	And so you'd have to start all over to build that up probably.
aa	Right,
bf	Don't go through the whole nine yards
bf	So you've had fish for a long time.
qw	What size do you have now?
qy	Have you ever had it, crack or break or leak.
sv	Fifty five gallons, you'd hope it would never do that.
qy	Do you have all kinds of different fish
b	Uh huh.
^2	Real exotic.
sv	Well, they're probably harder to take care of
b	Yes,
qy	Do you have problems with the fish eating each other?
b	Right.
qw	how do you isolate them?
qy^d	A jar or something
bk	Okay.
b	Okay.
b	Okay.
b	Oh.
b	Right.
bf^m	It'll go through the slot.
qy^d	That works all right then.
qy^d	They will.
qy	Isn't that odd.
sv	You wouldn't think that.
ba	You're kidding.
qy^g	And that just makes you sick almost, doesn't it?
bf	Things are different in the animal kingdom,
b	Yeah.
bf	Survival of the fittest or something.
b	Right.
qy^d	but. If you're like me, you never have enough time for the hobbies.
aa	Okay.
sd	We got into it because of SEATO agreement, back just right after World War Two that, we pledged a mutual, defense of the South Vietnamese,
sv	so, we, we have to deal with the, situation as we played it.
sv	don't get me started on those people.
na	okay,
ad	Can you hold just a second, Terry?
ad	One moment please.
fa	Sorry for the delay.
sd	the, the, mutual defense thing was,
ny	Well, yeah,
sd	and they're also our allies in SEATO, which was the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which has since been, disbanded as far as I know,
sd	so, we kind of, we kind of got the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly operations and then the you know, full scale troops, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
aa	yeah,
nn	No,
no	Well, I used to be a real big Cowboy fan
sd	it's kind of hard not to be a Cowboy fan, though.
sd	They've always been, you know, my favorite.
sd	and and I guess I still have a soft spot.
sd	I just hate that that's the coach that's leading them.
qy^g	they're in the playoffs, right?
ba	I'll bet they are.
sv	football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world.
sd	Hit a bad season
sv	First good season, the coach can do no wrong.
sd	But they Dallas has always been good ahead, you know, heading good players and both running backs and defense.
qw	Who is the competition going to be?
sv	Course, I think, you know, you can't really go by what happened earlier in the season because teams jell together or they've had injuries that heal
sd	and, you know it can be a tot , or injuries that, have newly happened and it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one we played.
sd	Well, Well, he really didn't feel like he'd be able to do a lot of passing at O U.
sd	O U has always been known for their running game.
b	Right.
^h	I tell you,
qy	Are they?
sd	I haven't been watching.
ba	Well, good for us .
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I can't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago, because I'm not that old yet.
sd	I mean you didn't have video games.
sd	you go into a business today
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd@	And now it's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute. * slash error Because you can get it there, you know * "Because" as connector; sd in a matter of minutes you know, through a fax machine
sv	and because of that, these quote, unquote convenience type items have made work that much more intense and that much harder.
sv	Because you're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Well, there's that
b	Yeah,
sd	Well, In terms of the long term effect on America, in terms of the culture and everything, I don't know.
sv	 of the next generation is going to be or, or an, ex , ex , extremely large part of the next generation is going to be, you know, second generation, from immigrant parents.
sv	And they're going to be really struggling
sd	I mean, it's no longer the, the accomplishment that it once was
b	Yeah .
aa	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sd	But, that's just since, in the past say about six years.
bh	you haven't?
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sd	But the problem is, that I am very liberal politically
sd	Liberal politically,
bh	you don't?
bk	Okay,
sd	and, the Democrats were the Doves,
ny	Yeah,
ny	yeah
sd	the big Republican thing is that they vote for less government,
sd	and so they're less apt to vote in, you know, more aid to people,
qy	so have you ever voted at all?
qy	You haven't?
qw	How old are you?
ba	gosh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
nn	No,
aa	yeah,
aa	yeah
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
qw	So what do you think about what you see on T V about them, like in the news or on the ads,
qy	You don't?
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
sv	Or they word it so that it's really hard to tell where they're standing on certain issues.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it all depends again on whose writing it and who they're for, because they can slant that too.
b	Uh huh,
aa	Right,
bd	Well that's okay.
sv	like, God, this is really good actually, for to talk to somebody who hasn't voted,
qw	how, what kind of stuff would you like them to do so that you would know more about it.
b	Uh huh.
qy	do you?
qy	Or do you feel like it's not really going to make that much difference if you don't vote
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh,
sd	we're really independent.
sd	But a lot of families do that.
sv	And that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved .
b	Uh huh.
^2	Hart?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
aa	that's very true,
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
aa	That's right.
sv	But see they're trying to find an excuse not to deal with you know, the issues that people really want to know about, because on those issues you have to say yes or no.
sv	So they just try and make it a personal thing,
sd	That's about what it looked like.
sv	I just thought he was really inept.
no	Well I think that was part of it,
sv	people just had a picture of Carter as not being real capable,
qy	Did you?
ny	Uh huh,
qy	You did?
sd	Well he is really active still politically.
ng	Well, unfortunately very little.
sd	Well, I, am an assistant teacher in business technology
sv	exercise is so important.
sd	And I realize that.
qw	When you, exercise, what do you do?
sd	I got a hold of, Richard Simmons' tape,
t1	what is it,
b^m	Sweating to the oldies, / * title
sd	That's pretty upbeat,
sd	Not often enough to have a routine .
sd	My little Schnauzer wishes I would get out and walk with her.
sd	But, I don't know,
b	Yes.
sd	Here, about the most common exercise for people is to go to the malls and walk,
sd	Because they're enclosed
sv	And it's safe.
sd	That's, you know, inside the mall
sd	I know a doctor once told me it,
sv	The, swimming, they say, uses more muscles than any other exercise with,
b	Right,
sd	Summertime only.
sv	You don't go out when it's twenty some odd degrees, go out to the swimming pool.
sv	Hot tubs are not too bad,
qw	So, what part of Mississippi are you from?
qw	Whereabouts is that?
b	Oh,
sd	Ours started Thanksgiving.
sd	And, from there just,
sd	And, there was no exercise.
ny	yeah.
sd	I, like you, I haven't done any in quite some time except for what I call living now which is very close to camping .
ny	Yeah.
sd	And it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress.
sv	I mean, when you have to have it, you have got to have it.
sv	And, you know, in those those kinds of situations, room rent which is outrageous.
sd	So, my buddy and I, we just camped .
sd	And we figured, what the hell,
sd	Of course, we didn't really rough it that much.
sd	But it wasn't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove .
sd	You know, I had a little boat house and floated it out on Lake Grapevine.
sd	And, well, it was fantastic.
sd	and then we would go to work and come back to the, you know, boat house at night
sd	And, it was great.
sd	But, you know, now all my life is more like camping than not camping really.
ny	yeah.
aap	Well, actually as a matter of fact, they just ran the phone three years ago.
sd	We didn't have a phone.
sd	They didn't have phone lines.
sd	And, we are third from the end on the electric string.
sd	So, we are at the end of the mail route .
sv	Like I said, we are probably as far as you can get from the Seven Eleven and still be in Texas.
sd	But, you know, right now, what we did, my wife and I, is we got a mobile home. One of these twelve by forty eight's that got repoed, And, swapped them a Cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring I would build a house some day, you know.
sd	I'm in construction
sd	And, I came home from work one Friday afternoon
sd	it is not horrible,
b	Uh huh.
ba	Sure.
^2	Became civilized.
b	Yeah,
sd	roughing it for me is going to the Holiday Inn and getting a shower. You know.
sd	But, you know, she has a lot of fun.
sd	she goes to dog shows.
sd	See, she shows dogs
sd	but you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel.
sd	So, she, you know, takes the motor home .
sd	if he would buy her a motor home .
sd	I am going to need a vacation .
bk	Okay.
sv	I guess the first thing has been for the right, for women to vote.
br	I'm sorry?
aa	It sure does.
^2	Role?
b	Right.
aa	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
h	and I don't know, what the status is on it,
h	but you know, I haven't really heard much about that recently.
b	Uh huh.
bh	is that right?
ba	that's interesting.
sd	I mean, You got to take the time off .
b	Yeah.
sv	I think that we're probably going to see a lot more companies, run by females.
br	I'm sorry?
aa	Right,
sd	Well, in Texas, we have a female governor.
sd	And we had a female mayor here in Dallas,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right, you know,
sv	there are issues that, you know, as far as, like, equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff, I totally am for.
sd	But, I don't get into the real women libber movement, you know.
b	Yeah.
aa	Right,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,

sd	And it takes a long time,
aa	Yeah.
aa	It is.
fc	Nice talking to you.
fc	Bye .
sv	I think that it's getting to where they're not spending time together.
sv	I think, like in my situation, today, on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together, my husband's been off doing his thing all day today,
sd	two years.
sv	it's really hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and, you both have hobbies that are different.
sv	you know, if you have hobbies that are the same, then, you know, you can enjoy your hobby together,
nn	No,
sd	and I was off, you know, doing, you know, household type things. You know, laundry
sd	and, did some shopping and stuff.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	I don't have that choice.
sd	I have to be at work at X hour, you know, at, at a certain hour

b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	the mom stayed home, you know, and raised the kids.
sd	so she was there pretty much all my, you know, formative years.
sd	And that was nice
sv	yeah, I, I think that, I think very few spend quality time.
sv	I think that, most kids that I see they don't really value quality time.
sv	until they're older
bh	really.
sv	I think kids now a days are raised on T V.
sv	and not a very good one at that.
sd	I hope to, of course, be able to teach them right from wrong.
sd	I, I know a lot of people who,
sd	and they do a lot of volunteer work
sd	And I'd like to be able to do that.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	And I don't, I don't really see that trend changing much,
b	Yeah.
sd	I never had that kind of experience.
b	Yeah,
sv	It's like a home away from home for a lot of them.
aa	Yeah,
fc	Well it was really nice talking to you.
fc	Thanks
fc	bye,
sd	well I really enjoyed,

aa	That's true.
sv	You don't sound like you're from Dallas.
bk	okay.
qy^d	you just managed to escape the real Texan accent,
sv	I thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
qy	were you really, trying to find someone at home?
sd	Well, you know, back then what they tried to do, you know,
sd	And so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation.
sv	I don't think they really cared about the answer,
sv	they just wanted to try and catch him in something .
sv	but I believe in paying taxes
sd	you know, I don't want to pay more than I have to,
sv	And I get outraged when I feel like they go up for useless reasons,
sd	So, I really do,
qy	do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work

b	Well, yeah.
qy	Did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act, it seemed like it made everything harder?
sd	I didn't notice anything simplified about it, except that they took away the deductions, the interest and, other things .
b	Yeah.
sv	And it will help tremendously.
sd	We bought ours five years ago
sv	So that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
aa	That's right.
b	Huh uh.
aa	That's right.
aa	And that's exactly right.
sd	Just because of exactly what you said,
sd	You're making one more months payment every year.
b	Yeah.
sd	And when we bought this house, we looked at doing a fifteen year note, because it added more to the payment, but not significant amounts, you know,
sv	it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	Well, that's good, though.
b	Yeah.

sd	I don't mind the children when they're selling things for school.
sv	but when it's adults selling a variety of things and especially when men arrive at about ten o'clock in the morning it makes you not feel particularly safe
sv	and, it's annoying as well.
aa	Right,
sd	but, I do feel like it's an invasion of my space.

b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
qy	Did you see that, where the guy asked him for proof of who he was,
aa	I know
sd	It was so funny to see,
sd	Well, I can tell you, that the Mets opened, I think, two days ago,

sd	but I don't even know if they're still New York Yankees, or New Jersey.

sd	I know I'm always scared of that whenever I go to a game.
sd	and if there's a game on, he's watching it.
sd	and he's like glued at the T V.
sd	I'm glad my husband's not like that either,
sd	so my brother's wife and my husband and I went.
sd	And he describes it as, you sit there in a crowd,
sd	so you sit there

qy	have you been out of the country?
bk	okay,
sd	when I lived in Washington, D C, I never went to the Washington Memorial,
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	But, the problem is , like first time I went out of here, they took me to Las Vegas
sd	and that was the most boring place on earth.
b	Yeah.
bk	okay.
sd@	that was fun. That was, / * slash error, two utts

sd	Well, my dad, all he wanted to do was get money for us,
sd	and to me, you know, it's like, now I'm twenty two,
sd	and the way I was brought up,
sd	and it's very hard for me
sd	and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old,
sd	but, you know, it's like, I can only express myself so much,
sd	and so, that's that whole thing that he'll say when, like, like
sd	and, I was brought up the same way,
sd	but what he does is, when he gets home, he separates his work from his house.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	and you got to try to be with them as much as you can
sv	and, and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time, you know,
sv	first of all you're coming to me
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd(^q)	and I told him, listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids.
sd(^q)	He says yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	But, you know, like, I mean fou , four children is expensive, like, especially for me, which I'm paying out of state tuition.
sd	And, you know, people say, you know, it's expensive to think it's college,
sd	and well, it costs two hundred dollars for books,
sv	I mean, it's like, if you plan a year ahead, you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know, one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college, you know.
br	excuse me?
sd	Well, I'm doing computer engineering.
b	Yeah,
sd	because since I'm an international student, they want to send me back to Argentina.

b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right,
sd	and, I guess it is a concern of mine, you know, for my own safety.
ba	Well that's right.
sv	I think it seems that there's certain areas where, the crime is focused
sv	Well, I think what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols, trying to put more guys, more cops, higher visibility,
sv	and probably, they need to try to increase community involvement, that sort of thing, I think .
b	Yeah.
sv	and they've got to do more than just having cops there.
na	I'd say it's probably in the top ten in terms of crime.

b	Uh huh.
ad	Well, you'll just have to plan a vacation some time and go over there.
b	Yeah,
sd	but I just love going over to Europe because their way of life is just so different than ours.
sv	You know, we're so fast paced here,
sv	they're so leisurely over there

nn	no,
sd	you know, you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something,
sd	or like the newspapers, they just dial randomly and stuff.
^q	you call me one more time, I'm going to stop subscribing .
sd	but the, Orlando paper, yeah, they refused to take it off of the lists

b	Uh huh.
sd	and since it wasn't shipped to her address, she could prove, you know, that it wasn't her.

aa	Yeah.
b	Right,
sd	It's, marketed, of course, its own dealerships.
sd	Usually, or somebody that's maybe got a Cadillac or Lincoln and Lexus dealership,
sd	sometimes they do that,
sd	but I've really liked it.
aa	It really is.
sd	It's got a C D player in it,
ny	Uh huh.
sd^e	But there is not very many options on that car.
sd	some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north. The C D and the premium sound system.
ny	Yeah,
sd	it's not just antilock brake.
aa	Yeah.

aa	I know.
ba	no.
sd	Although most of them are ordered them with it,
sd	I did not get the traction control which also, when you take the traction control , and the suspension thing it also puts heaters in the front seats, too.
sv	You go out and get in that real cold car
sv	and you turn that on,
sd	And those two are sold together
sd	so I opted not for that
sd	So the only thing I had to decide on was whether I wanted a C D or not in the stereo system
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	and, I'm leasing the Lexus.
sd	I just run it through my business,
sd*	the Lincoln ride is certainly good, too, but this Lexus is nothing like I have ever been in before. / * one or two utt?

sv	Seems like it can't get much worse.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
sd	And, especially come home every couple months.
br^m	You have five?
qy^g	Well you do have a hard time finding time then don't you?
b	Uh huh.
bk	All right .
sv	I think you're doing a good job.
sd	well there's not much I can do about it.
sv	but it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the pivot point of the universe.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And I was the youngest.
sd	So I understand how that worked.
b	Yeah.
qy	Did you all do a lot of organized things like, Little League, soccer?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	You know, I think that's probably true. The,
sv	and if you have a large number of children then you don't.
aa	No,
sd	like my son is in, Little League this year.
sv	You know, one parent go one direction
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I don't think, although i ,
sd	I mean, there were five of us
b	Uh huh.
sd	Atlanta is horrible.
ny	Yes.
sd	the housing is so cheap in comparison to Boston that they jump on it.
sd	They sell their house,
sd	The housing is cheaper,
sd	Well, we live in a brick home in far north Dallas
b	Yeah.
aa	It is.
sd	So you've been there longer.
sd	and we subcontracted it out ourselves.
sd	and then we subbed it out,
sd	My husband got his big garage.
sd	and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines
aa	It is,
sd	and if the house w , was large, it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have.
b	Uh huh.
sd	So we put a three car garage in.
sd	But, even if they had three car garages, they didn't have a work space.
sd	And so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on.
sv	Well, sounds like our husbands have similar interests.
ba	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	Well, we still have a son and daughter in college that come home.
sd	And the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come.
sd	and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom.
aa	Right.
aa	That's true
sd	Well, I haven't reached that point yet.
sd	He's out of college and has a good job,
sd	so he could afford to get married but, is not engaged yet,
sd	and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while,
sd	That's what she plans to do.
sd	So, I hope so.
ba	ho ho.
ba	A whole new world.
aa	I can understand.
b	Uh huh.
bf	So you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, that's the same thing that I did.
b	uh huh .
ng	Well, my husband and I haven't done a whole lot of camping,
sd	and we were hoping, to do some camping in the van,
sd	And it was really nice.
bh	Really?
sd	I don't like really camping in the rough.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	Other than, you know, taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something and sweeping it out everyday, it's really hard to keep the sand and dirt out of it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
bh	Really?
qy	have you ever used those?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sv	So, it's not really, I guess, camping the way most people picture camping in the tent
b	Yeah,
sd	And he just tows it behind his truck.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	Well, theirs was so bad,
sd	and they had to get out of there.
ny	Yeah,
ny	But, yeah,
nn	No,
aa	Yeah,
sd	I mean I think some people that had fairly sturdy, vehicles or whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water, I think they stayed.
sd	it was either that or their truck was going to go floating downstream.
b	Yeah.
qy	They have them right at the campsites?
ba	Wow.
qw	So, who is your favorite football team?
sv	Well, I would say the Saints after , since ,
qw	What's that?
bh	Yeah?
b	Yeah.
sv	Can't, call them the New Orleans Ain'ts any more.
aa	No.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I'm a Buffalo Bills fan. from a, from a long time ago.
sd	So, it's good to see the Bills doing so well now
b	Yeah.
sd	Jim Kelly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	the N F L draft really seems to be doing its job
ad	look at the Cowboys now .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	And just because they had a couple of bad seasons.
aa	Right.
aa	Right.
sv	You know, he'd, never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy.
aa	you're right.
h	And, I don't know,
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Well, Yeah.
aa	I know.
sd	See, I can't even think of who the New Orleans quarterback, is.
b	Yeah.
qy	were they able to draft anybody this year?
b	Uh huh.
qw	Well, when is the, N F L draft
b	Right.
b	yeah,
b	Sure.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
na	That was a few years ago.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
 +	lucky though to have, Jim Kelly than,
sd	I'm pretty sure he was this past season.
no	when I can.
sd	I'd have to confess I don't really scope out the New Orleans games, per se.
sd	New Orleans just isn't one of the areas,
sd	I was born in Buffalo
sd	and I lived in Detroit, too.
sd	But, first and foremost the Bills.
sd	And it was good weather.
qy^g	We beat Buffalo in, was it third of December?
sd	So, we couldn't a done much better than that in Buffalo .
b	Yeah.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my gosh.
ba	Sure,
ba	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	I, I don't think Jim Kelly is about to be swayed away from the Bills any time.
aa	All right.
sv	So, I mean, when you take, professionals and put them in situations, they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education,
sd	I have a real issue with that.
sd	so my opinion I think there's a big concern
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
sd	a lot of the school systems don't even, the kids nowadays don't even know what the president's fitness education program is all about,
sd	and, I talked to a thirteen year old last night who goes to, one of the Plano high schools or junior highs, I guess,
sd	I have a real problem with the whole system.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I mean, I was absolutely flabbergasted at what she was paid.
sd	Of course, if she got her Masters degree it would all be different.
aa	taxes Lord forbi , Lord forbid, taxes.
co	Maybe I should run for office, .
aa	That's true.
ba	That's funny,
aa@	Yes, / * one utt
aa	Right.
qw	Where is that?
qr	North, south, east, or west?
sv	Well, you live almost in Oklahoma .
b	Yeah .
qy	You know where Saint Joe is?
sd	I'm about eight miles south of it.
sd	Well, you know, I've seen those statistics and everything,
sd	I mean, the Iraqis didn't have a lot of high tech weaponry,
sd	And, they didn't kill as many people in forty five days,
sv	I mean, that was their job, as they killed in Washington D C.
sd	Well, I formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years, I guess.
sd	and just let them go
sv	and if they get convicted again, well, just kill them.
sv	Well, I think that the best hope to eliminate crime, as we know it today is to eliminate the criminals from society.
sv	If someone is known to have been in prison, they can't get a job.
sv	They can't be accepted into society.
qh	And, you know, who's to put the limit on it?
sd	And they're still let out on the street after one or two years.
sv	Well, they may find a cure for it,
sv	Hey , people make mistakes.
aa	Well, yeah,
sv	At least they might get some benefit in that,
sd	But, you know, with the technology we have today, you can put a collar on a guys leg that will knock him down if they leave the property.
sd	And, you can put a collar around a guys leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of prohibitive act.
sv	But, you know, putting them in prison, my God, that doesn't work.
ad	Well, you look at places like Turkey.
sd	I mean, if you get convicted of, you know, drug trafficking, they just kill you.
ad	And, you look at their society
sv	I mean, You know, the way to stop that kind of behavior is two fold.
sv	One, you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under seven.
sv	And then, if a parent has proved to be unfit, for any reason take the kids away from the parents.
sv	Because, you know, we are what we teach.
sv	Because that's what our society becomes.
sd	and I've, I've lived in that environment for quite a few years when I was doing construction work.
no	They're sociopathic.
sd	And I worked in a first grade classroom for one full semester
sd	and these kids were more foulmouthed than I've ever been.
sd	Told me that daddy's going to whoop me to death.
sd	You know, and they flipping me the finger and all that
sd	and I just said to this kid,
^q	Because you will eventually be killed.
b	Huh uh.
aa	Exactly.
sv	Well, you can see it in the work place, you know.
sd	Now, you know, people get fired,
h	Or, one thing or the other.
sv	And one of the things that's in their culture that I really think the major corporations should pay attention to, is the fact that, while Japan was becoming a great power, financially, the people that worked for those companies, worked for the same company they worked for at sixty five, as they did when they were eighteen.
sd	And the company, took it upon itself to find a position for these people.
ad	You look at Frito Lay.
sd	Well, she could type about one hundred and five words per minute,
sd	But, you know, her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is ...
qy	do you have children in school?
sd	I have two that are, now just about ready to graduate from college
no	well it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade.
sd	My son leaves the house at seven thirty and doesn't get home until three o'clock.
sv	And I think that's such a long day for a kindergartner.
sd	And, I have a preschooler.
qy	do you have the standardized testing now?
b	Yeah.
nn	No.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
bf	you would like to know what they're doing right .
ba	me.
ba	me.
b	Yeah.
bf	It's hard to explain to them why you can't.
b	Right.
ba	dear.
b	Right.
b	Right .
qo	How about the kids.
b	Huh. .
b	Right.
aa	Yeah.
ba	it is.
aa	That's right.
^q	We hardly ever play
aa	likewise.
aa	Right.
ba	Wouldn't that be great.
bh	Is that right?
ba	my gosh.
sd	Well, for example, in my son's kindergarten. They're really finished at lunch time.
sd	And, I think either send them home or do something a little more interesting.
aa	I agree.
ba	I wouldn't be surprised.
sv	I doubt if they would say it was too long .
qy	do you have the before school care, at your school and the after school care?
aa	It sure is.
sd	I'm on it,
aa	No.
sd	And I do enjoy playing.
sd	Right now it's three.
sv	Well, if you play with some consistency though, you can get it right back down.
sd	well, we can usually play here year around.
sv	But there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play,
sv	It's a good game though.
sd	That's the way I look at it.
sd	and then I see how close I can come to that.
b	Yeah,
sd	Well, we just had the tour championship here in Pine Hurst.
sd	And I went to that.
sd	this is a big golf area.
sd	I'd say we probably have within fifteen miles, twenty golf communities built around courses that are pretty well designed and then of course, Pine Hurst
ny	Yes,
sd	most of the courses have a, two day advance tee time you have to call,
qy^g	That's some cold golf too, isn't it?
no	We have cold.
sd	Usually January and the first two weeks of February.
sd	But, last week we were in the seventies.
sd	But, it's supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties.
sd	But we don't get any snow anymore.
aa	No,
^h	let's put it this way.
sv	They've had some serious problems in the past couple of years.
ny	Yeah.
sd	well, partly due to ownership.
sd	and he always had this wonderful quality of being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something
b	yeah.
sd	Now you're, you're from Texas.
sd	So you've got two football teams down there.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	There's that type of segregation,
ba	Wow!
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, it's a good past time, you know.
sv	Particularly football.
nn	Well, no.
sv	I think that,
sv	And the hand eye coordination
sd	we're a big hockey area up here,
br	What, hockey?
nn	No,
sd	There's no professional hockey teams in Texas .
b	Yeah.
sd	Like they have this World Football League.
sd	There are those teams that play in professional, National Football League
sd	and there's teams in the United States
sv	And there's only so much football you can watch.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Now, have you ever been to a professional football game?
qy	Have you?
qy	Did you do the whole thing, the tailgate party and the whole,
sv	Well see, now see that's what you got to do, see.
b	Yeah,
sv	well the same thing.
sd	there's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games.
sd	You go, you know three or four hours before the game.
sv	it's not so much, sure the contest itself and the game itself,
sv	that you miss sitting home in your parlor, you know, with a six pack of beer and some, potato chips, you know
sv	you miss that.
sv	and any professional sport I think, you miss that.
sv	The atmosphere of being there, you know.
b	Yep.
sd	we rent a lot of videos too.
sd	we saw,
aa	Well, I don't either.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	I haven't seen that one yet.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
sd	I haven't,
sd	But, we haven't seen that one yet, either.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Supposed to be his debut in comedy.
sd	Which was an interesting movie, but not very funny.
qy	Did she?
sv	Well, it was an amusing movie.
sv	I guess maybe it would have been better if we'd have been at the theater as opposed to, just at the house watching it with no one else around.
b	Oh.
sd	LITTLE MERMAID and PETER PAN I think are his two favorites that we've got .
qy	I didn't hear that was coming out.
sd	Well, they just had THE RESCUERS movie
qy^g	that was a Disney movie, wasn't it.
sd	my kids are just small babies
sd	and, there's so much out on video now, that it's almost, you know,
b	Uh huh .
sd	And, someone said that was a lot of fun to go do.
sv	And, of course, you need a baby sitter for that .
sd	I know we get discount tickets where my husband works,
sv	but, other than that it just seems like it's so expensive.
sd	we went on vacation couple months ago,
sd	That was kind of a funny movie with, Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray.
sd	That was fun.
sd	Richard Dreyfuss is a, psychiatrist
ny	Uh huh,
ny	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
sv	Must have left an impression.
no^t	I guess so.
b	really.
b	Oh .
b	Yeah.
sd^t	I think five minutes is the max.
no^t	I don't know.
aa	Right,
sv	Well, that, and in the schools, too starting to put metal detectors in,
nn	No,
bh	Is that right?
b	Uh huh.
aa	I know .
aa	I know,
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sv	and that may impact it as well.
aa	Right,
aa	Yeah
sv	they don't think twice about it.
b	Uh huh.
ba	You're kidding.
qy	Himself and her?
ba	wow,
aa	I know,
sd	I was watching some show the other day,
sd	and they brought up what happened in Killeen here recently,
aa	Right,
sd	this person had mental problems
^q	 you know,
b	Yeah.
bh	Is that right?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I remember seeing that,
na	I saw that on Hard Copy .
aa	Yes.
bh	Is that right?
^h	I'm trying to remember,
sd	and he just shot them himself and her.
sd	I remember seeing that.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	it's not one of the bigger ones. It's probably, I compare it to the size of Plano, maybe a little smaller.
bh@	really? * slash error No . / * nn

o	Okay.
fc	Good talking to you Archie .
nn	No,
sv	I, I think the country is, too ingrained in the inches and just the general, background,
sv	it's going to disorient and confuse a lot of people for years and years
sv	and it's not in our national consciousness to do it.
sd	our land is in acres,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	And it's easy to trans ,
sd	because I'm a mechanical engineer
sd	and it was not hard
aa	Really.
b	Yeah.
aa	Absolutely.
b	yeah,
sv	I think it's still good they do cover the system.
sd	And they do,
sv	and that's acceptable.
b	Yeah .
aa	Really .
sv	You know you need twenty gallons, but you need how many liters .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.

qy	Have you been cross stitching long?
b	really.
aa	it's not.
sd@	And once you get started on it, I just, I love it. / * two utts
sd	I do a lot of my own patterns also.
sd	In fact, I did one, BILL THE CAT, you know, from Glenn County that, was a real good one to do.
sd	It was tough,
b	uh huh.
sd	I'm still trying to get all the D M C colors .
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
ba	Good grief .
sd	There's lots of shades of greens.
sd	They had quite a few new ones come out last year, that they added to.
bk	yes.

sd	We missed it last year,
aa	Right.
aa	Right.
ba	well, that's neat that you like cross stitching also.
b	Yeah.
fa	I'm sorry.
aa	Okay ,
sv	But it is peaceful,
qy	is it one of those afghans that I've seen in the packages with the large squares?

b	yeah.
fc	Well, I've enjoyed this.
fc	But, well keep up the good,
fc	All right,
fc	Bye bye.
sv^t	it's something that you can really talk about.
sd^t	I don't know what we're going to do about it,
sd	you know, when they say the Middle East, it's such a big area
sd	and there's so many different problems there.
o	Well, I'll tell you something,
sd	and they're really quite, arrogant about it all.
sd	So, they're really quite arrogant about it.
sv	I'm sure this is the one time that the Israelis are really happy to have their big brothers, the Americans,
sd	but, I didn't really talk about that with her.
sd	But, when they were living in Israel, it was, the Palestinians, they come in an,
sd	But they really do,
sd	if I lived in Washington, D C I think I'd have a different attitude about Black people
sv	So it's just a different world.
sd	I talked to someone about San Antonio,
sd	and, they said that they have, you have quite the problem with, the ghettos,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
qy^g	No,
ba	my,
sv	and we're just so protected.
sv	It's just what do you do for them,
aa^2	To do it,
sd	he should have let them, corner the Republican Guards,
aa	Yeah,
sd	everyone I talk to, they says, you know,
aa	Yeah,
sd	yeah, they, they did, they stuck right to their goals,
sd	what they were going to say.
sv	So they were playing it very safe,
sd	they, I don't know, they, it, Schwartz , Schwartzkopf knew what had to be done
sd	he knew what was going to happen, more than any of us.
qh	and you knew this,
sv	And it's just too bad that we couldn't see that.
qh	Well you know what I was hoping?
aa	Yeah,
h	But, I don't know,
b	Yeah,
b	yeah,
aa	You're damn right,
b	yeah,
fp	Hello there.
br	I beg your pardon?
nn	No,
sd	you're from North Carolina.
b^m	Raleigh,
sd	Well, my name's Mary.
sd^t	I was visiting my son down in Dallas,
nn^t	No,
b	Yeah,
ba	Right .
na^t	I'm ready.
aa	All right,
sv	if I knew that I'd be a very wealthy person.
sv	Well, you have to see,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
bf	It's easy,
sd	Drugs.
sv	And that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased.
aa	yes.
b	Yeah.
aa	No,
sv	Well, but you know, the perhaps, not strange, but something that many people don't realize, is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty one and fifty two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids,
sd	And, in fifty one and fifty two, the police came to the high school where I was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs, how to recognize the pushers outside the one entrance, that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started, and so on, and so on.
sv	So it's a problem that's been around for over forty years,
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right,
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
aa	That's right.
sv	But the guy at the very top, the one who's really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure, and had the political pull to keep the interest or the emphasis in some other direction, other than on the drug dealing,
sv	because it sure is monstrous in this country.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
nn	Nope,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Right.
fc	Been nice talking with you.

sd	Well, we've been married for five and a half years
sd	so, I don't know if we did a good thing to buy a house or not
b	Uh huh.
sd	that's, that threw our budget really out of whack too.
sd	And we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all,
b	Yeah,
sd	and they're both boys
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	On your friends,
sv	and, you know, a lot of things like that that really are hard to plan for.
aa	Yeah,
sv	you're going to have on extra expenses for car.
b	Yeah,

qy^d	so, that's not a good way to ,
sd	that's what my husband said,

b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's true.
sv	It only takes one time.
sv	It's a hard lesson to learn.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Well, it's doesn't seem like I get enough time to watch much T V,
sd	I've watched that SISTERS a couple of times.
qy	Haven't you?
sd	I like that one,
b	uh huh,
bh	Do you?
b	Oh.
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	well, I've been home with a,
sd	and so I'll watch a soap occasionally.
qy	Do you watch any of those?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh
qw	what ones do you get into?
b	uh huh.
b	Oh.
ba	How funny,
sd	but, yeah, I was really trying to think.
sd	I have a six year old,
sd	Well, they watch it.
sd	and he's entertained by it.
ny	So, yes,
aa	Yeah,
sd	I do turn that on.
sd	Sometimes I watch that.
sd	let's see, it's on at four.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yes.
sd	So, other than that, I don't know.
nn	no.
sd	It snowed a little bit, probably about four days ago
sd	and they said we weren't going to get any more for Christmas.
ny	Yeah
sd^e	there is snow on the ground.
sd	I wish it would snow a little bit more.
ba	really.
ba	my goodness.
b	Yeah.
ba	goodness.
ba	gee
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	boy.
b	Yeah,
qy	Well, now, do you work for T I?
b	uh huh.
na	I've probably talked maybe to five people.
sd	My husband is doing it too,
sv	but it's been real interesting and kind of fun.
sd	five dollars.
ny	Uh huh.
qy	don't you have to do it as part of its,
sv	Well, I think it's probably a combination of things.
sv	those are the ones I think primarily contribute to acid rain,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Automobiles of course are contributing, too,
sv	kind of hard to do anything about that, I guess.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I was just reading an article in, MOTHER EARTH NEWS magazine
sd	you know a lot of places are burning wood
sd	a lot of people are burning wood,
sd	and, they've had you know, catalytic converters on those, on,
sd	and, apparently it sort of feeds itself.
sv	That might help a little bit, especially in some places.
sd	Now sometimes we get a kind of a,
sv	Probably blowing up there to you guys .
b	Yeah.
sv	I hope we're not too late with it.
^h	What are we having?
nn	No .
sd	but, I don't know,
bh	you are
ba	My goodness.
bh	really.
qy	is that hard?
bh	really.
b	Oh.
b	Huh.
qy	well, does a boar taste just like regular ham?
bh	Does it.
ba	Oh my.
ba	my goodness.
qw	well, how many people are you planning on serving at Christmas?
b^m	Eat it all,
sd	I don't,
b	Huh.
b	Oh.
ba	my goodness.
b	Yeah.
ba	my goodness.
bf	And that softens it up, huh.
ba	gee.
qw	Well, what else do you serve with your pig?
bh	do you?
sd	we just got lots of snow .
bh	really.
ba	my goodness.
ba	gee.
ba	My goodness.
ba	boy.
ba	gee.
sd	I'm all in favor of it,
sv	Well, I think as a whole that being that the drug problem, the drug industry can, bring so much money to a country.
sv	Just that, money is power,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	we fall out of, agreements with certain leaders
ny	yeah,
aa	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sv	they were feeding us, you know,
^h	Oh,
sv	and we're, allowing, it to happen.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I thought, it was the other way around.
sd	I don't quite understand that.
bk	yeah,
sd	Well, they actually understood,
b	Yeah.
b	 Yeah.
sd	I never really thought of, it that way.
sd	I don't know,
sv	and yet, you know, they have the same problem where, you know, where kings and such,
aa	yeah .
sd	Idi Amin was, you know, in power for so long.
sv	racial, I think ,
h	I don't know about education
b	Uh huh.
b	Really.
sd	and I've been sort of disappointed how that they say literacy rate has gone down, you know,
aa^m	In our country,
sd	that is really upsetting
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah
ba	boy.
ba	Yeah.
bh	Are you?
ba	No kidding.
qy	are you going to, put your son in child care in a year or two?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	Well, that's a good experience, I think,
sv	and what we found, to be the best guide was our own instincts about, people who were going to be loving
sv	and, that's more important than anything else.
sd	she goes to a home.
sd	They've been here probably thirty, forty years.
sd	They've got three daughters.
sd	And our daughter is healthy, happy, well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends,
sd	so it's a good experience.
sd	if it's good,
sv	And if it's, a loving environment, I think it's very good
sd	but, we feel real fortunate
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
sd	Out here at Manford, they have you know, a, a, a real good facility
sv	So you know, it's a, it's a, it's an important, decision,
sv	and I think this really is buyer beware. Well, it is the best way to do it, interestingly.
sv	I think that, my own interest in human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that, private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn.
sv	Because, I think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market.
sv	Primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life.
sv	it's phenomenal.
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	Well, I, I think we come from different backgrounds,
sv	have different perspectives that you are.
sd	because it has almost everything in it.
sd	What we've found very useful is a book called THE THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK,
b	yeah,
sd	but they're, but they're interesting they're interesting menus, combinations that nobody thought of.
^h	gee,
sd	and that was, you know, that's, that's certain you can do in thirty minutes.
sd	But there are a whole lot of, you know,
sd	THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
sd(^q)	Well, you had said dinner, you know, you know,
sd	the inspiration was a combination of Julia Child for the dessert, you know, a chocolate mousse recipe and a sort of cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called chicken marabella which is this wonderful thing you can do,
sd	basically you're baking chicken in an open pan, having marinated it first
sd	marinated in olive oil and some seasoning, and cooked with some olives and some prunes,
sd	comparatively.
sd	I just love ,
sv	Well, maybe a little more leisure time to do it.
h	I don't know,
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, there again, sometimes it was easy,
b	Yes.
fc	Well, nice talking to you Cheryl.
fc	Bye.
ny	yeah.
sv	I suspect a lot of people, got, turned on by watching those go off.
sv	very exciting.
sd	I've always, wanted very much, to, be somehow involved in all that. And, to, meet and to see it actually happen.
sd	Of course, I've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday.
sd	But, that seems rather unlikely at this point, unfortunately.
sd	computer programmer .
sd	Unfortunately, that can be done from the ground .
aa	Yeah.
sd	frustrating at times.
qw^d	I don't know what you think about all that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I've always, felt that, one of the long term solutions that, at least a few of our problems would be to have, some sort of, solar power satellites up.
sd	because that's a, you know, singularly renewable resource that doesn't require, any particularly nasty environment impact.
sd	And you can just get as much power as you need up there.
sd	It's just a matter of how big you build it.
sv	and, of course, the side effects of this is that you have to have, lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that I think we should be doing.
aa	Yeah,
b	Right.
sv	The only problem is, of course, that, that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there.
sv	And they want to do the research
sv	the only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like, the trip to Mars. Which would, would produce some useful scientific research and so forth,
sv	but the same money could probably be far better spent on, lunar bases and solar power satellite research and, you know, so forth.
sv	it would de , it would be being done for the, glitz and show factor to get politician votes instead of for, you know,
sv	we should eventually send people to Mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so.
sv	We should do it for, for the return we get for it.
sv	And, unfortunately, that's not what I thinks happened . / * listen
sd	I would settle for the glitz if the side effects were useful, like the,
sv	the downside of that is after you do one of those, people say well we did it.
sv	Now let's now we're done .
sv	No need to play around with this space stuff anymore.
sd	Well, I do love to fish.
arp	Well, I don't know how much you can learn.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Well, I hope it is,
sd	I don't do a lot of deep sea fishing,
sd	and I do a lot of fishing for, bass.
sd	And then when I get tired of them outwitting me, I fish for catfish
sd	and we use worms and shiners, which is pretty much like minnows a little bit bigger than minnows,
sd	and then I also use spinner baits and plastic worms.
sd	It all depends on what I'm fishing for, and the time of day.
aa	I do.
sd	Fishing's a good way to do that,
nn	No,
sd	I wish I had a boat,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
na	You have to get back in the sticks in the,
aa	Right.
b	Oh.
sd	We don't have, We don't have a big problem with turtles,
sd	but we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes.
sd	And I, Well, I can't think of a time that I've been fishing that I haven't run into one or two of them.
nn	No,
sd	we have a lot of cotton mouth,
sd	and they live in little coves that I like to fish in,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
aa	Definitely.
qy	Do you have bass?
b	Right.
sd	Well, we have those.
sd	inevitably, if I enter one of those, I never catch a thing.
sd	I just go out there and sit and watch other people do it.
ba	yes.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	That's what I do a lot.
nn	No,
nn	No,
sd	I'm being facetious.
sd	I kind of look at it for more of a,
sd	Got our businesses and, and our life in line, how to manage credit cards, how to put away, say for, you know, money markets and this kind of thing.
sd	And, there's some freebies out there
sd	That being money market, bonds, , savings, or just a liquid account which we do.
ad	you should always have three months of your salary in a savings account in case there's a major need for that.
b	Okay.
sd	Some of them are there to pacify situations.
sd	But, I guess we kind of got away from about the last sixteen months as far as saying, two hundred dollars for food and three hundred dollars for this and two hundred for that because we had a child which is about a year old,
sd	I've been developing it,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you have your, loans through the Texas Credit Union?
bk	Okay.
sd	If you go up there and write them a two thousand dollar check it doesn't all go towards principal.
sd	They take out for the finances the finance charge, which is kind of, you know,
sd	it's like one of these lose or swim type of credit,
sd	I don't know what your percent is on your car payments
sd	but they'll take any T I non credit union loan like if you have a fourteen percent loan for a new car.
sd@	They'll take it and refinance it and put it with Texas Credit Union at I think it's a ten and a quarter percent. Which is not a bad deal.
sd	One of the secretaries we have down here is paying twelve percent through G M A C or something.
sd	And she's doing it.
ng	I think they even cover that because they want you as a they want the T I er to be part of the credit union.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, five years is not that bad of a problem only because you're paying more interest,
bh	really.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
sv	and you need to be very careful,
sd	because you'll save fifteen to seventeen years off the end of the loan.
sd	I'm sorry, seven to nine years off the end of the loan.
sd	And there is a local firm that'll actually,
ny	Yeah.
sv	the interesting thing, we're getting ready to have a house built
sd	it's not, a lot of the firms that offer,
sd	You can ask and you can wheel and deal,
sv	It's a great idea.
fe	man.
sd	And you can figure up exactly when like the eighteenth month of a loan, if you make like a four hundred dollar payment over and above your house payment it'll make,
sv	it has a magic with numbers.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
bf	Somebody you trust.
sd	I got taken on firewood.
sd	I mean, the guy shorted us a half a cord of firewood,
sv	Absolutely pathetic.
b	okay,
sv	Might be a good idea, because you're going to get, what, a check,
fp	Hello .
fp	I'm Nola
ny	Yeah,
bk	okay.
b	Okay,
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That will be fine.
fp	Hi.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
aap	Well I, I think overall that's right.
sv	somewhere in there someone's going to have to learn a different way.
sv	You know, an, I think that,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	But, that's the type of thing they understand.
sv	They don't understand any other way.
sv	They wouldn't have understood anything than what we did in the war.
sv	There was nothing else.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	I can't figure out why they adored him.
b	Yes,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	What's sad is that the leaders that have control are power,
b	yes,
sv	Which I think that that's not the way the majority of the people over there really are.
sv	But in a way the war, I think in a way all, the involvement over there too, though, has shown that there are a lot of people that don't follow what those few are doing.
sv	and I think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these, newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the, soldiers leaving, you know, surrendering and, trying to get out of that situation.
aa	That's right.
sv	and I think so much of it is what you're taught.
sv	You know, they teach their children, in such a way that,
sd	And although we don't have any criminal actions here, we do have other, lawsuits that do go to trial from time to time.
t1	And, when was it,
sv	And it's very difficult for lay people for somebody who might just, you know happen to be selected in our jury, to understand what we're talking about.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	But it's a shame that,
sv	You could feel that you really have a very strong case and that you're very much right
sv(^q)	so you get a little you know, anxious there and go well, you know, I don't feel that sure
sv(^q)	and who knows what the jury will say because sometimes, you know, the juries come down with a result and you go, gee .
b	Uh huh.
b@	 really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bh@	Oh really ? Yeah,
sv	and we protect him so much,
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b@	 .
ba	Jeez.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah, you know.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	but they never told us why these two people, hated themselves or if one had done something to, you know, really aggravate the other
sv	and I had a tough time with that
sv	I still have a lot of reasonable doubts
sv	I don't know that I want to, sit on a jury like that
sv	and you'd still, you know,
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
b	Right.
fp	All right.
nn	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	What do you do for the surprise things that you don't necessarily plan for,
b	Oh.
qy	Do you kind of continue, call this like, a part of savings account or a different savings account
b	Oh.
b	okay.
b	Hm.
b	Okay,
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Okay.
sd	Checking account a lot, not so much credit cards.
sd	and so pretty much now, we don't use them too much.
sd	Or if it is a purchase, then it's paid off when the bill comes.
sd	but that hasn't always been the case .
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bk	okay.
b	Okay,
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, I know,
sv	you haven't made, big purchases
sd	But, all those, just monthly payments and stuff that just go out the door
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah.
sd	and I used to hear stories from my Grandpa,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	yeah,
sd	This is only my second phone call
bf	like social changes.
h	and I don't think this would have anything to do with it,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	I see a lot of, girls wearing sixties clothes.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
h	I don't know though,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah.
sd	Well, I've had them, where I've served up to twelve to sixteen people.
sd	and I had help with them.
sd	I had, just different, side dishes and appetizers
sv	I guess you could use the hot if you wanted to.
aa	Yeah.
ad	And, you put that in
sd	and then, like, I just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen minutes
b	Yeah.
sd	It's making me hungry for them right now.
bh	Have you?
sd	And, when I've had so many people, to feed, like I try to do a ham and a turkey
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
nn	No.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I'll bet.
b	Yeah.
sd	I like things that are easy and, nutritious.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
sv	and it just makes it a lot nicer where a don't spend all my time in the kitchen.
sd	And, Spaghetti
b^m	Yeah.
aa	I know,
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sd	I like it, too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bk	okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	And that's the way to do it, too.
sv	you know what's I think so nice is in this day and time that we can have good food that's good for you
qy^g	And, And it makes an awful lot of difference, doesn't it?
qw	Well, what do you is think is the main change in?
b^m	You're twenty nine,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah,
sv	it's funny,
sv	I don't think, changes are still progressing,
sv	and, if I had to somewhat abstract about it, it seems to be the major change has been that woman have acquired more choice.
sv	I mean, that's sort of the meta, the meta change as it were. where that woman really have more of a choice now about what they do.
sv	course, they find that the choice creates its own hardships in a way because life is not quite as simple even if it is for your, you know,
sv	but, it does seem
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
b	Right.
sd	Well, I only know,
sd	And, I have a lot of respect for her, because she made it as a real choice.
sd	She really knew that she didn't have to do that,
sd	and, she wanted that role.
sv	I feel that a lot of, women don't,
sv	and then you, and then it's not a choice anymore.
sv	and frankly, it's the way that men are.
sv	they don't feel this choice.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I didn't happen to see that.
aa	yeah.
sd	but they were very apologetic about it
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	They can have paternity leave, as well as maternity leave.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah,
sd	I mean, my friends who are having children are having them at age thirty.
sd	And, if I'd been a couple of generations ago, they would have had kids running around by then.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	And, I think, most people make better parents when they are a little bit more mature.
sv	I really do.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I really am.
sd	I mean, I have other things to complain about,
b	Yeah.
sv	It really is.
ba	really!
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh .
qw	what's her name?
aa,ar	No,
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right
sd	I don't know if you saw those,
sv	And, it was acceptable to say certain types of things to her that she couldn't say back, that kind of thing, which, I, I found myself getting quite enraged about.
sd	But, really, that's a previous generation.
sv	it's harder to imagine people of our age doing that, and not feeling really stupid.
sd^t	Well, they've gotten their five minutes worth of us.
fc	Okay,
fc	Bye, bye.
sd	Well, well, today, when I got up it was twenty nine degrees.
sd	And we've also had extremely strong winds, fifteen to twenty miles an hour, for the day.
bh	Is that right?
bh	really?
sd	We had one of those two days ago. but, no rain at all yesterday and, no rain today.
ba	Thanks a lot .
qy	was it?
sv	Well, one thing's for sure we can always discuss the weather,
ng	What's that?
aa	yes,
sd	And I grew up in Saint Louis,
nn	No,
nn	No,
na	I'm sure I didn't.
sd	We had about three or four days of that,
sv	So it, it really wasn't too pleasant .
sd	I hope, not.
sd	Well, they are predicting rain and thunderstorms,
b	yeah.
aa	Yes.
sd	a week ago they had golf ball size hail coming down in one part of the city of Dayton itself.
sd	And, then we just had about an inch and a half or two inches of rain in less than an hour.
sv	So, it wasn't, it wasn't conditions to being out in it
bh	Is that right?
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
sv	that was, very fortunate for them because that could have really been disastrous.
sd	Well, of course this is tornado season,
sd	but, northern Indiana, has many tornadoes come roaring across.
sd	So, you know, we get a lot of bad weather in this area.
b	Um hum.
aa	Right.
b	Right,
b	Right.
b	Um hum.
b	Right.
sd	but I have learned to do, now that I am alone, is, to carry bags of salt in the trunk of my car.
sv	And then of course kitty litter is also excellent for that. I don't know whether you've ever thought in terms of, that
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	He brought him from Dallas.
ny	Yes,
br	a what?
sd	Now that one I'm not familiar with.
bk	okay.
sd	I believe,
b	Yes
sd	The minute it would begin to storm, he would just panic.
sd	And, I had to push him down when he was fourteen,
sd	And, then there was no point in having all my acreage.
sv	well, it was great.
sd	so this little dog has plenty of room to run.
b	Yeah,
bh	Is that right?
bh	is that right?
sd	well I was there once way back in nineteen sixty, I think for just a week's vacation.
sd	But, that's about the only time I've been to Florida, except passing through on the way to someplace else.
b	Uh huh.
b	Um hum.
sd	And, course there too you never know what the weather's going to be.
bh	is that right?
b	Yeah.
qw	What kind of woodworking do you do?
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, I like to think of it as a hobby, but I guess also, partly out of necessity. Just repairing things around the house.
sv	it's also a way of relieving stress.
ny	well, yeah,
sd	gotten a good belt sander
sd	The latest project that I've been working on and this has been kind of sitting here for a few months is a cabinet to put a T V in.
aa	Right.
sv	And it, works well because you can design it to suit whatever equipment you have
sd	And, that's worked pretty well.
aa	That's right.
sd	But what I need next is a good table saw.
sd	And I debate whether it's better to get just a straight table saw or to get one of these, rotary arm saws.
sv	it seems to me the radial arm saw is better,
sd	I mean, you set the wood down
sv	Whereas if you're ripping wood, you're probably better off with a table saw.
aa	Yeah.
sd	and, I used to put all the stuff in my basement,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Have you ever used a lathe?
b	really.
br	So you went to what college?
qw	And what did you graduate in?
b	Yeah,
bh	really.
sd	I'm going to B Y U,
sd	Forever .
b	really.
b	Yeah .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Really.
ba	that's great.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Wow, in high school?
bk	Oh.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
nn	No .
sd	and there's tons of students in it,
aa	Right,
^h	man. I think your advice is good.
sd	because I didn't,
b	Right.
b	Yep.
h	I don't know.
ad	go ahead,
sd^r	I just barely got home from the university.
aa	Okay,
aa	I agree with you .
sd	I hate the eight and a half percent sales tax.
ar	yeah,
sd	In Arizona.
ny	Uh huh.
sv	But that's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes.
sv	Well and I still think that, having lived in Europe for awhile, you know, difference in living conditions are certainly well worth, what we pay for it.
sv	Well, I mean, I think,
sv	and I'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have, then have to live there.
sd	Higher taxes.
sv	Still's that way to some extent.
sv	I think the other problem is, you know, it's easy to complain about taxes because there's something you, theoretically, can do something about.
sd	and you're not quite in the same situation
sd	I wish I didn't have to pay any more to my physicians in a year than I had to pay for all of my school taxes.
b	Yeah,
ar	No,
b	Yeah.
sv	Of course, I think with the graying of America, we're going to see that problem in lots of places.
^2	Or build roads.
b^m	Homes,
b	Right .
bk	Okay.
sd	Well, we, left here in seventy six.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Well, the problem we got is that we've got five children
sd	and so, we really want four or five bedroom house
sd	so we look at the paper,
qy	Are you looking
ba	great.
sv	That empty nest syndrome is going to set in, I guess.
ba	Great.
b	Yeah .
b	yeah.
b	Yeah,
aa	yeah.
sd	My wife and I can share a bedroom .
sv	I don't think it's possible unless you, you know, multimillionaire, something like that.
aa	yeah.
sv	but I think the thing's out there,
ba	Wow.
b	yeah,
aa	yeah.
qw	So. What kind of business are you in?
b	yeah,
sd	we're with an organization called, Wycliff Bible Translators.
sd	It's a missions organization and, doing, translation, linguistics, that sort of thing.
sd	it's got an office down here in, near Duncanville
na	Right.
sd	we were, really surprised to find that they're higher here.
sd	When we moved from Louisiana to Denver, it was astounding, you know, to find that prices were, I guess almost two or three times as high as we'd expected.
sv	Well, it's been very windy,
sd	we've already had to use that,
sd	so, you know, I forget from year to year.
sd	but I guess, you know, we're just out of March, and, will bring the rain in, April.
ny	Yes,
sv^2	A little bit warm and a little bit blowy, I think.
^2^g	Really hard to make too big of different comparisons, right?
ny	Yeah.
aa	Yes,
aa	I don't think we can either,
fc	You too.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	Well, I don't like it when, people listen to my phone conversations, like if they're outside my door while I'm talking in my room , or when people like look through my things in my bedroom .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes.
na	Definitely.
b	Right .
b	Right.
sv	I guess not,
b	Yeah .
ny	Yes.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
sd	I don't know.
b^m	No.
ny	Yeah.
h	Well, I don't know .
nn	no,
sd	I used to do that though because I was the youngest,
b	Oh.
b	Yeah .
b	yeah,
sd	and she'll just sit there and listen like I'm doing something wrong,
b	No .
b	Right.
b	Oh .
aa	yeah.
na	it can get busy,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah .
b^r	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I had an old boyfriend who looked through my notes one time .
sd	I was mad because those were mine ,
nn	No .
aa	Right.
sd	so that was upsetting.
na	we've got quite a few, actually.
ny	Uh huh,
sd	they're blurred,
sd	Well I guess that's the fluorocarbons
aa	Uh huh.
ny	yeah.
sd	I mean, maybe, one snow.
br^m	Kentucky?
sd	North Carolina is all the way on the east coast.
sd	It's further west than Georgia,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I've been out of Texas about ten years.
sd	twenty, seven.
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
sd	Actually, they've been doing the same thing here.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's true.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, you know, what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road,
sd	and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe.
b	Uh huh.
nd	Well,
aa	yeah.
aa	yeah,
sd	Well, you know what they've started doing is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they've started putting them up at the top,
sd	and that way it gets above, other cars on the road
sv	and, it really does make a difference, although it settles, you know,
ar	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I'm sure.
sv	Well, you can really feel it, you know, in your breathing, even normal people,
sd	and you know, it's killed several people.
na	actually, I just smoke one in the evening if that.
sv	It was kind of funny.
aa	yeah,
na	For ozone, and yeah, all that.
b	Huh uh.
b	uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	gosh, I think I would hate to live in California, the smog there.
sd	I mean, I can't believe they have warnings here, which it's mainly just when it gets real, real hot.
bh	Really?
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
sv	it's really pretty here.
qy	Is it?
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
ny	Yeah.
ny	uh huh.
b	Yeah,
nn	huh uh.
bh	really?
sd	Well, I'm going to have to get some.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you?
qy	Did you smoke when you were pregnant?
sd	I mean I can understand that, actually.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see.
sd	I was taking a voice I O class and actually doing some research,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
nn^m	no,
aa	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
qy^d	I bet you're glad.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	they take it for granted
sv	Very very corrupt, like the Panamanians were very corrupt.
sd	The thing about it though is the Panamanians is, a lot of servicemen down there.
sd	because I guess there was a big, scam that all these guys up.
sv	So, it's like everybody is into it,
sd	Interestingly in Honduras, It's very pro American.
sd	my girlfriend used to, be in the Navy
sd	In Honduras, very, pro American.
sd	And there's a lot of men, I don't know how many American,
sv	I mean, it's the lesser of two evils,
sv	But I don't know how corrupt the Honduran government is.
b	Yeah,
sv	that's the undoing of everything,
sv	That's the thing that will eventually, you know,
sv	It is having a good moral background.
sd	So, I was reading an article in the, National Geographic
sd	they don't have oil or anything,
qy^d	they don't probably take a lot of refugees from other countries either.
b	Yeah
sv	So we're suckers.
sv	They know they're not going to pay it back.
ba	I can imagine.
b	Yeah,
qy	Do you get spooked, you feel,
sv	Well, I think it does, especially because I just moved to Massachusetts and, they're having real problems because they have so many, police layoffs.
sd	And, personally I don't live in a real bad section of town
qo	How about you?
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sv	and a lot of kids, you know, are caught that way.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh
sd	I know they asked in the topic for ideas on how to control crime
sv	But, in, on the other hand they have to be because the jails are full.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's true,
sd	I know it.
b	Yeah.
sv	And, some people prey on that, you know,
h	well I don't know,
sv	So, I guess if they had, more of a deterrent, if they had more severe punishments it might be,
sv	I think it would concern me even more if I had children, which I don't,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	but, that's a scary thing too because at that age kids want so much to belong to a group.
b	Uh huh.
aa	It's true.
aa	Uh huh.
aa	That's the other thing,
b	Yeah.
sv	This is a depressing conversation though .
fc	Okay,
fc	Bye bye.
sd	There we are.
sd	Well, I have a Honda, hatchback, nineteen eighty four.
sd	And I had a hatchback, a nineteen seventy eight version before this one.
sd	And, I'll be honest with you.
sd	And, I can carry more in that trunk area in my little Honda than I can in the big cars,
sd	But I can carry as much in my Honda or more than I can in those other bigger cars.
qy^d	L X?
qy^d	It was an L X?
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yes,
b	uh huh.
sv	Ninety five is wild in any car.
sd	because I, I run over to Crystal City, or used to,
sd	but I'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes,
b	Yeah.
^2	Beautiful, beautiful machine.
bh	Is that right,
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, my eighty four just has seventy seven on it
sd	and I've made many trips to Washington and down to Virginia Beach, Virginia, where my mother lives, and things like that,
ny	Yeah.
sv	The weather this time of year has actually been kind of unusual.
h	I don't know.
ny	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
na	Well, it was around here last night,
bh	No kidding.
sd	Saturday or Sunday they were saying,
b	Yeah,
sd	and, approaches to low minimum both times
sv	and Phoenix never gets that kind of weather
ny	Yes,
sd	for Southwest,
bh	is that right?
ng	Well, now, I wouldn't call it danger.
b^m	Yeah,
sd	but it's not like it is in the spring time.
aa	Spectacular is the right word for them.
aa^r	Spectacular is a good word for them .
sv	It's amazing.
aa	yeah,
sd	cloud to cloud it can be really sensational here.
qw	Where are you from originally?
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	yeah.
qy	Were you near the Park Cities area.
sv	Beautiful area.
na	Well, we've skied,
sd	I've driven through it several times.
sd	and we do some skiing there lot of cross country skiing there.
ng	Well, not really,
sd	and, I've been surprised that we haven't seen more of the temperatures that we've got today, you know, that moved in last night.
aa	Yes.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
nn	No
aa	it is,
sd	and they're up over sixty five or sixty ,
sd	Well, I'm kind of that way too.
sd	And I get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day,
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
aa	That's right,
sd	As a matter of fact, I thought I had one funny story
sd	we wore shorts.
sd	And the supervisor from another area came up to us
sd(^q)	He didn't at least say to us, did you know you're not supposed to do that.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well I've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine.
sd(^q)	And they have said no .
b	Yeah.
sd	I didn't know that E D S has a very strict dress code,
na	definitely.
sd	it is definitely lined out.
sd	and a particular kind of shoe, you know, so high heel,
sd	When I was looking at her materials when she first started, you know, she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff.
sd	And it told about the dress code
b	Yeah,
sd	I mean it was like you can't have, you know, such and such facial hair, no beards, you know, and just really detailed.
sd	Well the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had, another person coming from Washington, our outside counsel.
sd	And she came with skirts, just like she'd be going into the office.
sd(^q)	And we'd try to say, didn't you bring any pants or anything.
^q	and you're going to have unload you skid look at the documents in the boxes and then repack your skid.
sd	She finally tried to go buy, you know, a pair of pants
sd	Some of our people in the legal department,
sd	And then there's another one who's a little younger and a little more yuppish
sd	and sometimes he wears the jacket to it.
sd	And some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes
sd	With you know, the little suspenders or something on
sv	but, I think a lot of times it's mainly who they're going to meet with,
sd	If there just going to be meeting with T I ers like to talk about a patent kind of thing and they're engineers that they're talking too, they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed
b	Yeah.
bf	It's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here.
sd	I've done some of the other speech programs,
sv	So this is a little different.
b	Yeah.
fw	Okay,
sd	Hey, listen, if I had my way, I wouldn't pay my taxes.
nn	No,
qo	Well, How did this grab you?
sd	And then it just frosts me terribly.
aa	Absolutely.
sv	I believe that's true,
aa	That's correct.
^2	Heavy involvement from the public.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Absolutely.
aa	No,
b	Uh huh,
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
sv	I'm sure they will.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes,
aa	absolutely.
aa	Right,
sv	You know, there's so much of it going on that it would really, you know, set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture.
b	All right.
sv	Well, I have a hard time thinking that they can control guns. Personally.
aa	That's right.
aa	Yeah.
sd	I'm originally from Colorado,
sd	there, there's a lot of hunters here.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think it's ridiculous.
bh	Really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Sure.
sd	I'm in, program control for a company up here.
ny	Yeah.
sd	We do schedules, for programs, schedule programs.
qw	What do you do?
bk	okay.
ng	I haven't had a chance to do any hunting since I've been down here.
b	Yeah,
^2	One for a total ban and,
aa	Yeah,
sv	I mean, if they can anyway get it, keep criminals from having guns which they can't
sd	you know, I'm not for it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
b	Sure.
b	Right.
b	really.
b	Yeah.
b	Sure.
aa	Me too.
ny	yeah,
qw	How is the weather up there?
qy	Is it?
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well normally when we go on vacation we go home, to Colorado.
b	Really.
ba	How funny.
bh	Really?
sd	We live up, Lake, in the Broadmoor area
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh,
ny	Yeah,
ny	Uh huh
sd	they don't have enough money to keep it going,
ar	Well you know, well, now I don't know.
sd	it's only a couple of hours away.
sd	I'd like to go on vacation.
sd	but we have two little ones that are under two right now,
sd	so we want to wait until they're a little bit older to do that,
b	Oh.
ba	Well, how fun.
b	yeah,
ba	Wow,
qy^d	And it was all a big package deal where you just pay one price and get everything?
b	Really.
ba	Wow.
ba	 what a deal.
ba	Great,
ba	Well, that's great.
b	Oh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	well, we like to ski, of course,
sd	because we moved to Texas about two years ago. So when we go back we are just jam packed full of people to see and things to do
sd	so we don't get a lot of time to just vacation.
sv	but, you know, other than that, with both my kids being under two, it's real hard to do any kind of events that, don't require as much,
b	Yeah
o	you should mention that,
ny	Uh huh.
qw	where do you,
sd	you're in Texas.
sd	So am I.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
nn	no,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Okay.
sv	So I'm real picky.
b	Sure.
sv	That's true.
aa	Well, that may be.
b	Yeah.
sd	my Cimarron is just so small and so low to the ground that I can't see past any vehicle , that's in front of me.
nn	no,
qw	what is the topic?
bk	Okay.
sd	I've had,
b	Uh huh.
sd	My dad has been a, Lincoln man for a lot of years,
sd	And, the last Cadillac I bought was an Allante.
sd	And I just love it to death.
sd	I used to do that quite a bit myself.
b	Yeah.
bh	Really?
sv	They seem to put, They seem to be put together a little bit better.
sv	And, you know, the buttons on the controls and things like that are a little easier to get to than Ford products
sv	and G M doesn't seem to do that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I had an Eldorado, was my first one, was an eighty
sd	and, I think at about sixty thousand miles I finally had it lined up.
sd	And I had them do all four wheels.
sv	That's true,
sv	You know. Lincoln is still as big as it always has been
sd	You know a car I ran across recently that has a tremendously large trunk is the Lincoln Continental.
sd	Well, the Town Car, I noticed,
sd	You know, straight across.
na	Front to back.
sd	Not going from side to side.
sd	And we got three full sets in there and still had room for luggage.
ba	I see.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	I don't know if you've ever looked at a Continental.
sv	it's not as peppy as a Town Car
sd	because it's a V Six,
ad	You might take a look at them.
na	all three of mine have had leather interiors,
sd	I had a eighty Eldorado, which was leather
sd	And, it had the gray leather package in it
sd	Well, I'd encourage it.
sv	It's a good general ed , education for a bachelor's degree.
sd	and obviously it's where they don't have any post graduate program there,
sv	they don't graduate the best engineers or the best English majors, but maybe a graduate pretty good overall students out of there.
sv	Well, for some people, it's good because maybe they need a little discipline, need a little reining in at that stage in their life.
sv	you know, you kind of choke on it
sv	it depends on the person, on the individual,
sv	but, the one factor I think more than anything else in this day and age that's got to be a big factor in your decision's just the cost how much you're going to pay no matter where you go to school.
sv	And if you've been in for twelve years, I'm sure you've, you've got your share of student loans that, you're probably going to be paying off or have been
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's good.
sd	I mean I know people or that I went to high school with that went to civilian colleges
b	Yeah.
aa	Exactly.
sv	it's staggering when you think that, just here in central New York, is,
sd	and, they're looking for twenty two thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now.
sd	A year.
b	yeah.
sd	I don't know how many people actually pay the whole shot.
sd	I just couldn't ima ,
sd	I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force now,
sv	even as a somebody making twice what I was making, how could you put half of that into, to your child's education
sv	and then just when they made, make it to the college years it's,
sd	My God, I can't imagine.
aa	Yes.
sv	Or, it's also a good environment,
aa	yeah,
sd	It can benefit different people different ways.
sd	But, you know, I agree with that, because I see people that I know again, from high school, that I still keep in touch with, that didn't go to college
sd@	and they do the same old things they did in high school and,* needs slash because following utt by B repeats utt of A; is not necessarily the intended end of this utt Same patterns of behavior, same socializing, same exact crowd that they hang with
sv	and it's like frozen time, you know.
aa	It is.
sv	it's a, it's a tremendous thing when you sit in a college environment and discuss some issues and really sit there with people with disagreeing opinions
sv	and, that's another big thing I think people get out of college is the appreciation for differing points of view, you know, or different opinions.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, your education's a lot what you make of it, too,
b	Yeah.
sd	I work in a labora , an Air Force laboratory
sv	even more so, like, military academy grads are a strange lot, too,
b	Yeah,
sd	and then certain things that
sv	But, these M I T grads are off in their absolute own world.
sv	but they're undergrads are like,
h	But, I don't know.
b	Right.
aa	Nope.
b	Yeah.
aa	No.
sv	But, having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as doing their job and spending time with the cadets there, is investing in the Air Force,
sd	or the military itself, it's the future officer corps
sd	For me any time I needed extra help any time of the day I had all my instructors home phone numbers
sd	and could call them,
aa	No,
aa	No.
aa	Right,
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
h	and, I don't know,
sd	personally, I don't have a problem with it,
sd	I would never have a problem with anyone testing me,
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
aa	That's absolutely right.
sv	I don't think anybody would ever argue that. Or, any after affects carrying over into the workday
sd	but, you know, I'm not particularly concerned with what people do, after they leave for the day especially if I don't, see any results of it the next day.
sv	on the other hand you've got, you've got the possibility of people,
sv	the company and, you know, what kind of people work there, what,
aa	That's right.
sv	And, there's a lot involved there.
sv	I think the regular schedule stuff, that when you say everybody get out of it, that's a good point,
b	Yeah,
sd	as far as the new hires, I hired on just early enough that I missed it. where the new hires were concerned
sv	people have really quieted down after everything started
b	Uh huh.
aa	No,
b	Yeah,
sv	You know, there's not a lot of pressure to vote the right way or anything else around T I.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Absolutely not, you know,
sv	But, it's still, it still remains a tough question
b	Uh huh.
sv	I really don't think so.
sv	you know, it may prevent somebody who was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^m	yeah,
sd	it can still show up
sd	and, those are the kinds of things that still can show up.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
aa	That's right.
sd	but, there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications
aa	Yeah,
fc	You too.
fc	Good bye.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sv(^q)	they are saying, well, you know, the people cannot afford it.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
^2	With a conviction?
b	Right.
sd	I do not know exactly what the size of the juries.
sd	and he only heard very, you know, piddly type cases.
sd	they give the person the option for a jury.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
sd	I do not think I would either.
h	I do not know,

b	Yeah.

b	Uh huh.
br	Excuse me?

b	Yeah,
fc	Bye bye.
aa	Well, yeah,
sd	one is two and a half
aa	Right,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	And we could, read the things in the history books and understand what they said, when it was like, we need to raise food quickly because this place gets very cold very soon.
aa	Right,
sv	and you know, nowadays there's a lot of people out there that you don't want your kid emulating or whatever.
b	Yeah,
sd	So that the only reason I'm home is because I'm home with a cold .
b	Yeah .
aa	Right.
sd	Likewise, we do some projects every now and then.
b	Oh.
b	Yep .
fc	Okay.
bd	Right.
fc	Bye bye.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	I don't get to watch a whole lot of T V.
sd	and so it's usually the nine o'clock shows that if we get them in bed, we usually watch that,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
no	Well, we have on SESAME STREET and MISTER ROGERS, that kind of stuff,
sv	It's kind of nice to know that they're just going to be seeing, you know, not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff
sv	and they usually, show a lot of things that really teach them different things about the world.
sd	My older son, he's going to be five,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Well, yeah,
sv	and I don't think that they really realize that death is forever, you know.
sv	And showing them something like that really doesn't teach them that it is.
aa	No,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh ,
sd	I was just going to say, I know that, at least before our kids were born, we used to always enjoy watching the COSBY SHOW,
sd	I like to watch DESIGNING WOMEN if the kids are in bed by then.
sd	we're in Dallas.
b	Yes.
sv	and it wasn't really that great.
sv	they've done everything dirty in the book you know,
nn	Well, no,
sd	Everything you could think of, you know had a hard time,
sv	and I think maybe with DALLAS, as far as, they lost a lot of characters that had been around at the first.
h	I don't know,
ny	Yeah.
aa	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
br	Where you can lock up, the channel or whatever?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	And I don't know the way the generations are growing up now,
sd	And especially in the summer time we aren't in the house very much in the evenings.
aa	Well, true,
fc	Well, it was nice talking to you, too.
fc	Okay.
b	Yes.
ny	Yes,
sd	Well, I'm happy we got through.
sd	Well, I'm especially interested with what's happening in the Soviet Union,
qy	is that reported in the Texas papers?
sd	I'm afraid I don't have the statistics in front of me.
sv	, it's not a tiny area.
sv	but, but it's more significant, in the sense of, it's a great agricultural region.
ny	Yeah.
sd	They're completely out now.
aa	Yes,
na	Right,
na	Right,
sd	It's done democratically,
ny	Yes.
ny	Yes.
sv	that's true, hasn't happened here for a while,
b	Uh huh.
aa	No,
qy	do you, do you blame the government in Washington for this?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	So then, it's, you think it's Reagan and Bush have done this
b	Uh huh.
aa	the Chinese use slave labor, too.
sv	that's one of the ways they get away with it.
aa	Yeah.
sv	I don't think there's any one simple answer to the whole thing.
sv	I mean that's very complicated.
qw	So which one are we going to throw out?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I like your governor.
sv	She's an impressive woman.
b	Yeah.
b	Right .
b	Well, yeah,
ny	Yes.
b	well.
b	Yeah.
qh	You know what?
sd	And we hired a professional landscaper to do it.
sd	Just two,
sd	but they are just eighteen months apart so it seems like a lot more.
sd	Four and five.
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, I have a twenty six year old stepson,
sd	Well, I did for many years.
ny	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
ny	yeah.
b	All right,
ad	Well you should of just ripped the whole thing out.
qy	is this the first year they have been up?
sv	Well, let me tell you, they do not come back very well at all.
nn	No,
sd	But I have just learned from doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do is you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done blooming. Because they do not take the heat here.
ny	Yep.
br	They call them flags?
qw	When does it, when does it bloom?
qw	And what color?
qy	And you only get one of them?
bh	You know what I bet you they are?
sd	And our neighborhood is a planned development with, I think, it is seven hundred and fifty five families.
sd	But we have about sixty acres that we have to plant.
sd	And I will get,
qw	And what does the foliage look like?
fx	I bet you what those things are, is a Dutch iris.
fx	I bet you it is a Dutch iris.
qy	does it on its, on the flower, does it have a beard on it at all? Any kind of fuzzies?
fx	I am going to bet you that,
sd	Well, I was just going to correct myself.
sd	Because they would have bloomed pretty early.
b	Yeah.
bk	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yep.
sd	Well then it is not a Dutch iris then.
sv	Well, I am not so sure that Texans know what they have got.
qy	Did you just move down here?
sd	Because I have got, I have probably got, do, do, do, I do not know how many square feet it is, a big circular driveway.
sd	and it looks quite formal.
qy	You want blue?
b	Uh huh.
bk	Okay.
sd	And it will send out a flower spike.
b	Yep.
b	Yep.
b	Huh uh.
b	Uh huh.
^2	Salvia.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I will tell you another plant that is purply .
sd	i , it, it is kind of a purply blue red.
sv	It is really a pretty plant.
ny	yeah,
sd^m	Purple Buddy.
sd	G o m p h r e n a.
sd	And they make, about a foot high plant.
ny	Yeah,
sd	and I'm out of cash
sd	So, I'm going to go back and do some consulting work.
aa	Yeah.
sd	Either savings or investment, one of the two,
sv	And as far as the rest of it's concerned, we don't have any kind of, what I would call extravagant expenses, you know,
sd	and the rest of it, you know, we pile into the house.
sd	but, we're still making the payments on them.
aa	Right,
b	Yeah.
sd	And where I live, it's pretty scary, because Texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that and you screw up, you don't get it finished,
sd	the bank can eat the contractor.
aa	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sd	You know. They can take your car and your clothes and your, anything
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, you know, we're not ones to budget much, you know .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	The land is paid for cash,
sd	Well, it's fraught with other problems .
ny	Yeah,
sd	systems consulting. Computerization for construction firms.
ny	Yeah.
b	Right.
bh	really?
bh	Are you really?
sd	I just got that a few days ago.
fe	gees,
sd	This guy's place burned down,
sd	Well, some of it wasn't worth anything, you know.
sd	You know, a lot of the, diskettes were just totally unusable.
aa	Well, yeah
sd	But I did get out of there with, Vermont Views, which is a huge,
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, I'm certainly in favor of AIDS research,
b	Uh huh.
qr^d	That's in the world, or in America?
bh	really?
qw	Whose figure is that?
bk	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ng	I think they should, actually, although perhaps not an incredible amount more than what they're doing,
sd	 well, I am sorry that he has the virus.
h	I don't know,
ng	well, not really, though I mean, I think he's probably doing the right thing for a man in his position,
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	yeah,
ny	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
ny	yeah,
b	yeah,
sv	Wonderful touch tone telephone there.
^h	have, I have a wide variety of hobbies,
b	yeah,
sd	and then I'll sit up and read just to refresh, you know, to keep active on it,
qo	How about yourself?
ba	that's great.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I bet that would be, rather interesting.
h	well I hate to,
sv(^q)	one of it's great slogans is if you're not serving the customer, you better be serving someone who is.
sv	so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is
sd	every now and then I'm loaned a tape I can stick in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable, talking about, better outlooks on things and the philosophy of Pat Hagerty and these kind of, mind stimulating philosophy type. Which all, you know, betters yourself.
b	Uh huh.
qw^d	Like what for example.
b	Sure.
sv	So those are self improvements.
sd	our supervisor, subtly bought all of us a book called WHAT EVERY SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW. By a man named Doctor Bittel, B I T T E L
sd	If he casually just walked into it and, put down a Stephen King book and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested.
b	Yeah,
sd	I have a hard time finishing books.
b	Uh huh.
aa	exactly right.
sv	but, that's just kind of part of it.
aa	this is true.
fc	Have a good day.
fc	Bye bye .
bh	Is it?
sv	A little disappointing the last few years.
sv	You know I really don't.
sv	you know, with that guy from Pittsburgh getting all that money, twenty seven or twenty nine million or whatever it was, I just don't think that they're going to be able to sign Ruben Sierra
aa	I do, too.
sv	It's just going to effect on the team, you know.
sv	We just can't seem to, you know,
sd	it's just too disappointing.
sd	I was a Pete Incaviglia fan
sd	but, of course, I understand baseball decisions are all just,
sd	They say as long as they draw up two million fans that Greave and Valentine will be there.
sv	and that's the name of the game, too.
sv	now, it's just it's frightening.
sd	You and I should be so lucky you know, to go out and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat or something like that.
aa	Yeah,
sd	but, I realize the difference,
aa	I know.
sd	But, one thing I don't understand is why a group, you know, headed up by George Bush would buy the Texas Rangers and not really get behind them
sd	but, you know, in the past half a dozen years, all we've had is the, the soccer team.
sd	I know.
aa	I know.
sd	I've been one,
sd	I mean I follow them
sd	I love Nolan Ryan.
aa	I do, too.
aa	It will.
b	Right .
b	Yeah,
sd	and they give him all kinds of money
sv	I think it's, a good idea.
sd	And, right now I see a lot of kids who get out of school, have no idea what they want to do.
sv	And there's a lot of things out there that we could do, for our own country,
"	let alone other countries,
sv	and I think that we've got the people power to do it,
sd	And there's a lot of housing,
sd	I know in the area that I live in, that's run down and beat up,
sd	and it's just, you know, sitting there wasting away.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	A lot of it has to do from too much T V,
sv	and, you know, there's, there's a heck of a lot of difference between, you know, the intake that you get from T V and movies, and what you hear in school, and then what reality is.
sd	I remember, I've worked since I was,
sd	like, you know, when I actually started working full time, I got married shortly after getting out of high school.
sv	Because, life, and the reality of working for a living, and trying to make ends meet, is just so overwhelming to someone, if they aren't prepared for it.
aa	That's true.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
aa	Uh huh,
sd	my parents are in their late sixties now,
sd	And, it's really hard on them,
sv	And, you know, there's a nice warm feeling,
sd	I mean, I was a Boy Scout
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Exactly.
b	Uh huh
b	Yeah.
b	Yes.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	That's exactly what they were trying to get them to do.
sd	both.
b	Yeah,
sd	they have another program in Maryland that's called Adopt A Highway.
br	What,
fp	I'm doing fine.
b	Yeah.
br	What is that?
sv	Well, we've got a pretty good situation, my wife and I, since our property is already paid for.
sd	You know, they give you an opportunity to either transfer into an on going project.
ny	Yeah.
br	What?
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah
sd	Well, I could see where that would be important.
nn	No.
sd	I don't know what it's about .
b	okay.
bf	Pretax insurance?
b^m	Yeah.
br	Um?
sv	it's probably what the first guy who did it, called it.
b	Yeah.
sd	I'll tell you what we could do.
sd	We could prohibit people from being hired that are historically going to cost the company money. You know, do a little bit better research on who gets hired
aap	Well, not only just health insurance, I mean for the whole benefit of the company.
b	Okay.
sv	Well, frankly, I think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid.
br	What?
b	Oh.
sd	I know.
sd	Well, there's two schools of thought on that.
sd	I got about eight years of education ahead of me before I can do that
sd	Then you have tenure.
sd	Well, you know, in a situation like that, I don't know if that's good or bad.
sd	And I've also had tenured professors that were the best things on two legs.
sd	Well, they really can't fire you without cause,
sd	You know, and I could see a point protecting someone's position,
sd^m	In some places that don't.
sd	But, you know, you get specialized education now, for instance, take computer science.
sd	You know, I went to college late on in life
sv*	I mean, my agree is absolutely worthless. /* listen; agree is probably degree
sd	Industrial Marketing.
sd	Well, actually I'm selling computer software.
sd	Well We've, we've, we've already got that.
b	yeah.
ng	Well, not really.
sv	You know, and that is something that I think needs to be expanded on, specially in the large market place. You know, the major corporation, because so often, you know, you get a guy who's got eight or nine or ten people working for him in separate areas so to speak.
sd	You know, it's hard for me to, you know, especially since I'm in marketing sales, you know,
b	Yeah.
na	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's great,
sv	Nothing wrong with that,
bf	That was a big savings.
ba	Well, that's great.
b	I see,
sd	We're having an architect friend of mine design a house for us
sd	and he's charging us about a buck a square foot to design it
sd	But, I have heard that your approach is right,
sd	you can even just sub it out to concrete and those kind of things
sd	everyone I talk to, I file in my little book and do other things with it .
b	Sure,
sv	If your happy with it, that's all that counts.
sv	That's all,
sv	that's, an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell, I guess.
fc	Nice talking with you, too.
fc	Bye.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I mean I include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments, you know, everything.
sv	And it tends to work out pretty well that way.
sd	That way I know how much pocket change I'm going to have left at the end of the month or at the end of the paycheck anyway.
sd	So that works okay for me.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qy^d	so you know what I'm saying,
na	sometimes it can be.
na^m	Sometimes it can be.
sd	But I do try to build in a little extra money each month to be able to do that type of thing
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's tough.
sd	My roommate only gets paid once a month
b	Right.
sd	There's always one or two stragglers that usually they were,
sd	but I would pay all of them at one sitting
sd	and it worked okay for me.
h	I don't know.
ny^e	yeah, it's really bad.
sd	But, it's going pretty well
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bf	That'll cover your gifts come Christmas time.
ba	That'll be good,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
ba	Well, that's a good way to a little extra money.
sd	Well, this is another way that I'm making a little extra money
ny	Yeah.
sd	I had not, done
ny	Yeah,
sd	I was about to call to see if I could get on with somebody,
sv	so that was great.
b	Yeah.
sd	the last movie I saw was REGARDING HENRY.
sv	It's really good.
ny	Yeah,
sd	it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sv	But it was silly.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
ng	I haven't seen that yet.
b	Right.
br	 Such as .
b	Uh huh.
b	really.
qy^d	They're really good?
nn	Huh uh,
b	Uh huh.
qr	I mean, is it, like mystery, or suspense
b	really.
b	Right.
bk	Right.
nn	no,
h	but, I don't know,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
fc	Uh huh.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	Generally, I get most of my news from, the radio.
sd	also, since my wife likes to watch T V, sometimes, just being there you know, I have to watch the news late at night with T V.
qo	How about you?
b	Uh huh
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
b	Sure.
na	Sure.
fp	Yes.
bd	Okay .
b	Right.
sd	And, you know, also late at night, you know, I don't like watching the news late at night
sd	but, you know, I wish I had, more news on things like, that I consider long range. Things like science and medicine
sd	I guess I'm more into science and science fiction
sd	and, you know, a lot of the news isn't that interesting to me.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Me, too.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	No .
b	Uh huh.
fc	Okay.
fc	Nice talking to you.
ny	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
fc	Take it easy.
fc	Bye bye .
sd	you know, we even lived there for a while when my husband was in the Navy.
sd	In fact the first year we were married, he had been there two years when we got married
sv	 it was very nice,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I'm sure.
sd	Roberto died while we were there as a matter of fact.
b	Yeah.
sv	It's like anywhere else.
sd	And, I can understand the frustration you must have gone through, going to the school,
aa	No,
sd	I had gone to a very, , conservative, college
sd	They weren't like any of the Mexican American or black people I had gone to school with
b	Yeah.
bh	really.
ba	my.
b	Yeah.
sd	I'm not, so much against their making, it a state.
sd	But I would want a very, very clear majority,
sv	And well, the, a, a few can make it miserable for everybody else.
sv	that my give you a clue.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	Same as any other part of the world,
b	really.
sv	they have the best of both worlds.
sd	but they don't have to pay all the taxes and so forth that we do.
sd	being that it's an island economy,
sd	So, so you know, I would just as soon,
b	Right.
ny	Yeah,
b	yes,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Part of that though has been, I think, selected by them, in that whereas they want the benefits of, of what the continentals can offer,
sv	they, they want to maintain that, culture of theirs, which I understand.
sv	and so often when you bring in the advantages, the resources and so forth, there is a trade.
sd	Most of the people that i , that I know about who really, would, favor statehood, have pretty much assimilated into the continental states already.
sd	Or they have family here and this way they can go back and forth
sv	That's the way the pendulum seems to be swinging, right now.
nn	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
^h	There really were three major, camps,
sd	and there were those who, were very friendly, very open, any, anything we can do for you,
sv	and, it was interesting,
sd	I can't think of the term
sd	And with banners and a parade of vehicles with their colors of the, of a particular party.
sv	So they were very, very, passionate, about their beliefs
sv	but it, it kind of broke down that you couldn't really see,
b	I see,
sd	Well I have enjoyed it.
fc	Uh huh.
fc	Bye bye.
qw	what is,
b	Oh.
ba	that's wonderful.
qr	what kind of fondue, the cheese dip or,
b	Right.
ba	that sounds good.
sv	That's always a good thing.
aa	definitely.
aa	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
aa	Right,
b	Yep.
sv	I think it would be a lot of work
sv	you have to cut each thing or, you know, use the melon baller and stuff
b	yeah
b	Right.
qy	is that good?
qy^g	I bet it doesn't mix well, does it?
ba	well, that's good
sd	of course, they had to be, grown in greenhouses and stuff and in ,
bh	is that right?
b	Uh huh.
nd	Well,
aa	Okay,
bh	Is that right?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think I know what you're talk ,

sd	I have some .
sd	I just want to,
b	Right.
bf	Cooking chocolate.
sv	That's really interesting,
qw	Well, how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own?
bh	Is that right?
bf	It would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	So you put the milk in the cornstarch?
qy^d	And then put that back in the saucepan?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	do you put it in the refrigerator then
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Actually I'm in Plano, too .
sd	I say Dallas area when I'm talking to people elsewhere.
b	Yeah.
qy	They actually pay you money for that?
sd	Brookshires up in Allen, you bring you know, they, the plastic bags back or the paper bags, you put them in the receptacles there,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
sv	but I think that's the way we need to go.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
ny	yeah,
sv	it's not bad,
nn	No,
sd	I don't scrub them or anything,
ad	throw the lids and everything out,
aa	Yes
na	those also.
sd	and then, of course, cans, coke cans, whatever.
sd	But, I haven't been down to the recycling center yet to find out exactly what they need or what they take, and all that,
b	Uh huh.
sv	yeah, it's not a big deal.
sd(^q)	when I went back to the store, and I said, Hey, I understand you all are taking these bags back, you know, what do you do with them.
sd(^q)	And they said, Well, people come in and put anything in the receptacles.
b	Yeah,
aa	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	I work for the University of New Hampshire,
sd	overall I'm satisfied with it.
nn	No,
sd	so the benefits,
sd	We get fifteen days a year sick time,
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I think, the health care, of course, is an important, and has to be the single most important benefit
sd	and, the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing, you know,
sd	I'm a little disturbed about that,
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental, depending,
sd	and, it covers the bulk of the dental expenses.
ny	yes,
sv	I think the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody, and the retirement plan.
sd	for the operating staff it's it's, you know, based on how long they've worked there.
sd	That determines how much, vacation time they get.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd	College programs belong to this T I A A, C R E F retirement fund.
na	Right,
sd	Well, I have gone to girls camp a few times, as you know, a chaperon or a leader, whatever
sd	and, I enjoy camping.
sd	we went camping at, Lake Bonham, which is pretty close here.
sd	and it got really cold at night,
sd	we take little nature hikes
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	We used to live in Utah
sd	and, of course, there's lots of mountains around there to camp in, and streams and stuff.
ng	I'm not acquainted with any, you know,
sv	there's a Tyler State Park that's, really a nice camping area,
sv	The Rocky Mountains are so much, bigger than anything that they've they've got down here that,
nn	No,
sv	they're not bad.
ny	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
b	I see.
b	Yeah.
sd	It just gets so hot in the summer you can hardly,
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
aa	definitely.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
qh	Do they wind up with more red tape, and more problems then?
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah.
^g	Well, you know ?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
ba	it's unbelievable how much you go through.
sv	it was just strange.
sv	well, that should help.
b	Yeah
ba	I see .
b	Okay,
na	Okay,
sd	I think we rented PRETTY WOMAN a couple months ago.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	COCOON?
b	Okay.
b	okay.
sd	I think I know who you are talking about though.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^h	I'm trying to think,
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	and I guess, more than anything, that is why we don't go.
sv	Plus, by the time you get a baby sitter, and then pay to go to the movies it just gets pretty expensive.
nn	No,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
br	Robert De Niro?
sd	I think you said Peter.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah .
sd	Well, you know, I think I read about that too.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	you haven't,
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sv	And, I thought that was really good.
sd	It was the one where he was a defense,
sd	And there was a murder of one of the women that was in the D A 's office.
sd	And then he ended up being accused of it.
b	Yeah,
aa	I was never into those movies, either.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
qw	What was the last one?
b	okay,
qy^d	Now I understand that, the real estate market out there has really gone crazy, up and down, up and down.
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
qy	Do you live in the high rise?
bk	Uh huh.
b	okay.
bk	okay.
ba	that's nice.
bk	Oh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah,
sd	The past, year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern Virginia.
sd	It just never happened before.
b	Yeah,
sd	and we have a three bedroom house.
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	They put pools and garages on, but, no basements .
sv	Maybe it's all the sand.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	it's just, you go down four inches
sd	And so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast .
sd	It's just solid sandstone.
nn	No,
b	Yeah,
ny	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	But, that's the same way out here
sd	and anything instead the highway, the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive.
sd	So, you know, I, I, I could never afford a house inside the beltway.
b	Yeah,
sv	not too much of northern Virginia is like that anymore.
nn	No,
ny	yeah,
nn	no.
sd	my folks, had an apartment for a while when we were kids
sd	and that's all I ever knew growing up,
sd	so. I stayed in a townhouse for, two years and then, saved up enough money to get a,
fp	Hi.
sv	But we are not living in that world.
b	Uh huh,
aa	yeah,
b	Uh huh .
ad	You know, let the world train them what to do .
sd	And I really would be at a loss to raise and train a girl.
aa	sure.
aa	sure.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
sd(^q)	I did very much the same thing until my boys got into high school and said Mom, please do not be involved.
sd	Then I went back to work.
b	Yeah.
b	Sure.
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
sv	Well, you know, there's a lot of things that have happened, actually,
sd	women at one time did very heavy physical labor and, were expected to maintain a household.
sv	Then as times changed, as it is today, we do not do a lot of physical labor, even in housekeeping, and homemaking,
sv	there's not a lot of physical labor, because, there are,
aa	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
sv	or we really do develop some health problems.
sd	So, in that, in that respect I am not so sure that the hard work of years past was not better for us than we are willing to admit.
aa	absolutely true
sv	but specifically the woman's role, in society has changed.
sd	And, you know, medical reports tell us that women are developing diseases now that used to be predominately male diseases.
sd	Heart disease was characteristic of men,
sd	now there's almost equally predominant in women.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Right,
sd	I do not know what the healing process would be or what was causing the problem,
sd(^q)	But, I do know that in raising my boys, I really did meet a lot of pressures saying, you know, you need to get them into music lessons,
^q	you need to get them into this,
sd	otherwise, I will guard their ability to have quiet time.
sd	I refused to cram their lives full.
sv	And that's the way it is with a woman too.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Of course.
sd	And I guarded my children's rights for that
sv	They are sacrificing their time with themselves.
sv	You are finding out who you are.
sv	Well, I think,
sv	Well, in the first place it's not your homework,
sd	And I was always very careful to be there only when they came to me and asked me for help,
sd	I helped them with exactly what they asked for
sv	That's a part of the problem that women have always had
aa	That's right.
sv	That way husbands are crippled,
sv	they are intellectual cripples,
sv	and so are children.
sv	They do not know how to think for themselves and be responsible, for themselves.
sd	I do not know why God made women brilliant .
aa	Yes,
sv	and that's never changed.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	That's right.
sv	You know I think that's one of the things that we have today that is very useful,
sd	we are not talking about strikes or things
sd	because, the mediator is an unbiased bystander who,
b	Okay,
sv	it's, course country
sd	Well, in Oklahoma we say Garth Brooks .
b	Right.
sd	so he's a home boy .
b	Uh huh.
sd	My son is, twenty eight,
sd	I can't say he's real crazy about elevator music, as he calls it.
sd	Well, my teenagers are all gone.
sd	You know, I teach
sv	and I find that the classical music is very good for the kids too, it doesn't disturb them and yet it's, it stimulates them,
sd	Well, it's nine through twelve
sd	Well, it's, business technology.
ba	boy,
b	yeah,
qy	do you play any instruments?
sv	Ooh, you took on a,
sd	well, my son played the sax and drums, my daughter the piano, organ and French horn.
b	okay.
b	Yes,
ba	that's wonderful,
sd	I have totally a tin ear
sd	and I love music.
sd	you know, and I love to listen to it, love to sing, and my kids, when I was little and, they were little
ng	Never.
qo	If you were, what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers?
sv	I think the major thing they need to correct is how long it takes something to get to jury, and to get to trial.
sd	And I don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or what,
sv	Hence is possible error as you can see in all the IRONSIDES, T V shows.
nn	No,
aa	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
no	I don't know.
sd	and they went by each one, saying guilty or innocent, guilty or innocent.
sd	And they took it more as just like a majority.
aa	Exactly,
sv	But, Rather interesting.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	What about in international trials.
sv	I think that would be kind of interesting.
sv	I guess the problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts like, you know, the old day with the rack.
sd(^q)	they're going to say, Okay, you're guilty and you have to pay Kuwait four million dollars.
sd	Nobody.
sv	But I think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of, you know, people from different countries, in as international law also.
b	Uh huh.
qy^h	is that the crime
b	Uh huh.
sv	but, I guess there should be some flexibility because every situation may be unique, that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum, things of that nature.
aa	Yeah,
sv	And I guess you're eligible after twenty seven for parole, even though you're in for life.
b	Yeah,
aa	No.
b	Yeah,
qh	But, who knows.
aa	I agree,
aa	Sure,
sv	since the state is paying for them, they should get some kind of work out of them.
aa	Exactly.
sd	Trading their lives for cigarettes those kinds of things.
fc	I think so.
fc	Nice talking to you also.
fc	Have a wonderful Easter.
fc	Bye.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
no	well, it was really my ex who did the, the cooking back when we first started
sd	you dumped everything in together
b	Oh.
ba	Well that's great.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, cooking was our secondary interest,
h	I mean.
sd	Well really just commune with nature.
sd	We started out,
sd(^q)	So my ex decided, we're going to try camping
nd	Well, ye ,
sd	But, there's really no time of the year that you can't go.
ny	Yes,
sd	Well, it just depends on where you go,
o@	where abouts? Uh huh.
aa	yes,
sd	I'm a New Yorker myself.
sd	A little town called Tuckaho, over by White Plains.
sd	Well that I wouldn't know
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I outgrew, sleeping bags and, tents,
sd	Well I live in mine.
ny	Yes.
ny	well, yes
aa	Yeah
ny	Ye ,
aa	Yeah.
aa	yes,
sd	Jack.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Are you, from Dallas too, Beth.
ba	Oh!
sd	Well that's where I am,
b	Uh huh.
fc	Nice talking to you too, Beth.
fc	Bye.
b	Uh huh.
sd	one girl went in state and has graduated,
sd	and I have, two out of state, both in Missouri,
^2	if they're content there,
sv	if it's a halfway decent school they should be happy naturally,
sd	and if they can get, two out of,
sv	and so there's plenty of scholarships out there,
^h	Well, they,
sd	and so he was pretty much looking for a Jesuit university,
sd	that was limited to five or six different places
sd	and, so I didn't have that much to do,
sd	and I, you know, helped them get there as far as traveling with them to look at different places.
sd	We did do that,
sv	Some people don't do it,
b	Right.
sd	my daughter has been in Missouri for a second year,
sd	so, you know, she's already twenty one.
sd	It'll save me a lot of money because I'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition
sd	but again, that's her decision
sd	but I have so many students in my classes that have dropped out and come back,
b	Right.
aa	I think so.
sd	Ended up going to where I used to go,
br	Pardon?
sd	It's Southwest Missouri State University
sd	and, it was twenty five hundred when I went there forty years ago,
sd	I teach in a school about eight thousand,
sv	but it's much better than twenty one thousand.
sd	and then, those rating,
sv	I don't put that much stock in them,
sv	probably fine just to compare.
b	Right.
nn	No,
sv	and I probably rebelled against it.
b	Right.
sd	and I have recently, gotten out of debt and everything
sd	I just, spent whatever came in and, never knew what came in and what went out. But, about like the government runs.
sv	So, I think it is probably better to have some sort of a, at least a record
sd	and, I mean, of course, he is from the depression,
sv	but, I think it would be smart if somebody would keep, some sort of a plan that works for them.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I could not believe he did that,
sv	but, to have looked back into the twenties, thirties and forties, it would have been fantastic, to see that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
aa	I know.
aa	I know,
sd	And I paid, between four and five dollars, in nineteen sixty.
sv	And that's really crazy,
sd	But, of course, it's just what the market will bear.
bf	If people will pay two hundred then why charge ten.
aa	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	The other one may be very careful,
sd	and she may marry somebody
sv	You should have one in the, in the house.
sd	And I think,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	if it had not been for my wife, I would have probably been in debtor's prison, if we had one.
bk	Oh.
aa	yeah.
sd	My wife is still in school getting her doctorate,
sd	and I have got,
aa	I know.
sd	So we were both in the same,
b	Yeah.
bf	That is the best one.
b	Yeah,
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Well, if I had your address, I would send you,
sd	and I can take some real great tours to Europe.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
sd	In the Quorum.
ny	Yeah.
b	All right,
qy^d	K U E N,
ba	Well good,
sd	well I know Zack Miller real well.
ba	Well wonderful,
b	Okay.
fc	Bye bye.
ny	yeah
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
bk	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
sv	I guess there's more women in, what would be classified as a man's job .
sd	I am a drafter.
sd	I am in a man's job .
sd	But we have got more women in it now.
sd	There's a lot of us in it.
aa	Uh huh,
sd	And I want to scratch it out and put drafter .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh,
aa	definitely,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.

qy	Do you?
ba	wonderful.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah.
aa^r	Yeah.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
nn	No,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	oh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	There's some men out there that are more feminine than most women .
b	Yeah,
aa	I do too.
sd	I personally would not want to go
b	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Good.
b	Yeah .
sd	I am at work right now.
sd	I put my work number,
sd	Usually, I am not there,
sd^t	but I probably talked to seven or eight people.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I personally have not made any calls yet, myself,
sd	But I enjoy receiving them.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
fc	Okay.
fc	Well, thanks for calling.
bd	Uh huh.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	Well, I try to be as well,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	you're in New York,
sd	It's called Lawry's, like Lawry's seasoning salt
sv	and it is absolutely wonderful.
sd	And, we were there a few months ago,
ba	is it, okay.
sd	It's the best I have ever had.
b	Yeah
sd	I think Italian and Mexican food are probably my favorites.
sd	But, I'm not into sushi or any of that kind of stuff.
b	Uh huh.
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
^2	fresh seafood down there,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
sv	But it sure is good,
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and, we sure go through a lot of that .
sd	But I like it hot,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
b	yeah,
^2	and the price. And the price. Make you want to come back.
sd^m	Recently,
ny	Yeah.
ng	Well, it wasn't really.
sd	And it was, just to, have some fellowship with her.
nn	No.
sv	And that was real nice.
nn	No,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
ba	well, that's nice.
sd	Well, my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity,
sd	And, they've been to the Guadalupe River,
sd	It's a whole new,
b	Sure.
ba	that's neat.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, you learn a lot of, skills too,
sv	and I think it really penetrates in your memory, you know, what to do, because you really have a great interest in it. Because it's something you weren't forced to do ,
sv	so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning.
sv	And you're more receptive.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's exciting.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh,
^2	Do your own thing.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's wonderful.
ba	I'll say .
sd	Well, I lived across the street almost from Canada .
sv	So that, that's a nice place.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yes,
qy^d	Well, you've been quite a few places there .
ba	Once you think about it,
ba	that's great.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
bk	okay .
b	uh huh.
bf	They kind of guided you.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, good.
sv	I guess that's why we need to plan for retirement, so when we do have the free time, we'll have the means to, pursue our dreams.
b	Yeah.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I understand that.
fc	You do the same.
ft	Thank you.
fc	Bye bye.
b	Right.
sd	I am very much for capital punishment.
sd	My Dad retired from the federal prison of bureaus.
sd	And I've been raised around prison prisons all my life.
sv	And I believe if you don't have a punishment befitting the crime, there's not any deterrent .
aa	That's right.
bf	Especially not a federal prison.
sd	Well, see the states prisons were under a mandate to,
sd(^q)	And finally our governor at the time who is not in office now came in and said, okay, where we draw the line is no sex offenders will be let loose. Under early bail, you know or early, get out.
sd	the death penalty is not given often.
sv	maybe well, it should be given, you know, I won't say sparingly,
b	Right.
sv	But then they're also entitled to drag it through the courts for years and years and years on appeals.
sv	So somehow, you know, it doesn't really balance out too much.
sv	And it seems even though, you know, that they got ,
^q	You know, I'm tired of fighting it.
sd	Then the system just keeps on.
sv	And at that point you know I really think there needs to be maybe a shorter appeal process.
sd	Well, part of that is the overcrowding of the court system.
sv	it doesn't help them any at all
sd	and, of course, your court system when you get into the appeals,
sv	We've gotten into a very litigious, type of life.
sv	I just feel like their crime and punishment
br	What?
aa	Well, yes.
sd	The war that just went on.
sv(^q)	And then, the United States has this attitude by saying, you know, thank you for keeping us our freedom and stuff like that.
sv	And it wasn't our freedom that you were saving.
sd	Kuwait wants to take Iraq out of the whole system, by leaving them independent.
sd(^q)	And so, when Iraq, you know, saw this, they said let's take over the country, which is a good idea,
sd(^q)	Then the United States says, okay, our oil prices are going to go up.
sd	well the main government in Moscow goes in there
sv	But these countries here, which, you know, are, you know, like in NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR,
bk	Okay,
sv	Now the problem is that nobody's going to invade anybody else's boundaries.
b	Right,
sd	But all the other countries, you can fight about.
sv	And so the thing is that you're wasting so much money to send, you know,
sv	And you know, it was basically all based on oil because nobody
sv	You know, and, that's something that has been, you know, very,
sd	I got to shoot somebody that's got the same family that I do. You know, the same relationships that I do.
sd	And just because I was born here I've got to shoot them down.
sd	but at least it was over quick
sv	Now the only problem is the aftermath, that you're having so many deaths in the border with, Turkey.
sd(^q)	Well, there's something that the U S did right which is say, say, you know, okay,
^q	And, now, indirectly let's try to overthrow him, you know.
sd	And they're not going to do that directly.
^q	You know, you can seek asylum here,
^q	and you can go there,
sv	Well the thing is that first of all they go , they have to get him.
sv	and there's no way that you can get them, unless it's by force.
sd	You know. And then you can put him on trial.
aa	No,
sd	You know, like if you were going to put on trial you get to live the rest of your life, but where.
sv	You know, and so, the thing is that once you've done something wrong, which is natio , you know, internationally recognized, then you're going to try to get out of it
sd	And you know like he sent planes over to shoot the people down tha , that were on their way to Turkey.
sd	He had a couple of them bombarded.
b	Huh uh.
aa	Yeah.
sv	we just put our goals in different, you know, levels is
sd	and we need it desperately.
sd	But the other countries, you know, that have oil but not as big, you know, like they say, you know, like when the prices went up then they went down.
sd	When they took that big dip it was because they discovered another big oil well somewhere in Saudi Arabia, or something.
sv	Well, it, its an advantage.
sv(^q)	You know, it's like you're saying, okay, I can bring my prices up to a dollar fifty a gallon and I'm not going to bring them back down to, you know, ninety nine cents.
qh	Why,
sd	You know, I went down forty cents,
sv	but I went up ten cents.
b^m	Yeah.
br	Ninety eight?
ba	God.
b	Yeah.
qy	I mean, have you ever checked, like, the most money makers in nineteen, ninety.
sd	and that was just because of the last quarter.
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean and what other companies went up four hundred and some percent.
sv	And that's practically impossible to do now a days, for a company to, to shoot up in that way.
sv	And, it's just that, you know, people take advantage of that.
sd	You know, but still if you realize that, one barrel has {D like, how much was it, like, } forty gallons,
sd	it's got forty gallons
sd	and it was selling like at twenty five or something.
sd	So you're making, you know, fifteen dollars profit, easily.
sv	I mean, and, the expenses, you know, of the war, you know, it's like who's gaining on this.
b	Okay,
sd	because, see like for example, I don't know if the British government owns Shell.
sv	But the thing is like the U S government got nothing out of it. Because, well, you know, it's like the other independent companies, the gas stations, you know, they did.
sd	And, then the taxes go up
sv	But, you know, they're just some things that might not be worth it.
qh	You know, and first of all how many people had to die before the war, you know,
sv	sure, you know, like to a couple people that died there, their families don't feel it was necessary to do that.
aa	Yeah,
b	well.
b	Yeah,
fc	Bye bye.
b	okay.
na	I guess so.
^h	dear that's a hard one.
qy^g	Well, it's because of oil isn't it?
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah.
b	yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
na	Certainly,
sd	and we won.
aa	sure.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.

aa	Sure.
nn	no.
b^r	For doing nothing,
b	Uh huh.
b	Ah.
sd	well I understand and can sympathize with that because I also enjoy driving performance automobiles.
sd	and I suspect if I were to be able to get another car where object was,
qy	a three twenty eight G T S?
qh	You just go hunting?
bf	Go out and lust after it.
qy	So have you had the opportunity to drive a Ferrari?
b	Yeah,
sv	Could sleep in the back of the 'vette.
sv	I find that the Corvettes are becoming really nice cars.
ny	Yeah.
sv	It's not like driving a Winnebago or something.
sd	Nice.
qy	Isn't that a practical van.
b	Yeah.
bf	Well, so it was a completely new experience for you.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
bf	So you won't get,
ba	Whoops.
b	Yeah.
^2	With the Bluebonnets out,
sd	I've got about four maybe.
^h	I'm you know, I'm in the age group you get out of college,
ng	I don't think I ever tried.
nd	well,
b	Yeah,
sd	It's your risk,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^2	the extended loan payment for your car.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Well, it's, it's business,
b	Yeah,
sd	And so they've already shifted the risk.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
br	now what's ten percent, we can deduct,
sd	I didn't know that.
qy^d	I didn't think you could,
sd	I've never itemized yet.
h	So maybe that's. Schedule A or,
b	Yeah.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Hell, I took a five year note out on my car right when I got out of college,
sv	Well, you think you're starting out well, until you start paying all those bills. apartment rent,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	you know, they're convenient, you know,
b	Yeah,
sd	and now I'm out here in Phoenix.
sd	none of these grocery stores take any credit cards,
sv	So, that was interesting, cause I always, you know,
sd	you didn't have to worry about carrying that much unless I knew I,
ny	Yeah,
sd	That's mostly locally,
b	Yeah.
fc	All righty.
fc	All righty.
ny	Yes,
sd	he'd come in there as a stray.
sd	he's a Pomeranian and Sheltie cross.
sd	well, he was very well trained when we got him.
aa	No,
sv	And, if they were local people, they would have been able to find him.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
ba	I think so.
b	Uh huh
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, I guess, in one sense we felt that, it's nice to have a dog even though there are, you know, complications come with it.
sd	And then with our children,
aa	Yeah,
aa	Well, that's the idea.
sd	And, from that aspect, I'm short on the discipline, because I don't, enforce that the kids look after the dog
sv	but I think it, it, you know,
b	Yeah.
ng	Actually no,
sd	might say we live right in the middle of a residential area.
h	but again,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	and the larger they are, the more room they need to exercise.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think it would be a great idea.
sv	Seems like there's so many kids that don't have any since of, you know, what they want to be or do
b	Huh uh.
b	really.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
h	but, I don't know.
sd	I didn't know.
b	Yeah,
sd	I sent off for stuff on it,
sd	You actually got paid too, while in the Peace Corps,
sv	but I guess, you could put some money aside while you were there, your expenses and,
ny	Yeah,
b	Really .
b	Yeah.
^2	Public hanging.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	Might not go if it was voluntary,
b	Yeah.
h	I don't know.
ad	Have a vacation in Iraq for a year .
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, it seems like it would develop pride, you know, in people, if, it's in their own country.
h	I don't know.
sd	Like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and ,
b	Yeah,
b	Huh uh.
b^r	Huh uh.
b	Yeah,
sv	they could send all the people over to, you know, one particular part of town or one particular project, that somebody had paid somebody to, you know, get supported,
b	Yeah.
b^m	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	She started some type of, national organization for youth to volunteer to tutor other kids to read and, you know, do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards, you know, helpful things,
sd	But they didn't have anything positive the kids could be doing, helping, you know,
sd	so they were trying to start that out,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	I see.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	And, there is men and also women,
sd	and then they, you know, go and actually live in that country for the,

b	yeah .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	but, you know, that it is incredible, you know.
b	Yeah.

bk	Okay.
co^t	You want to punch the button and go?
ny	Yip .
qy	Well, are you going to buy a car soon?
qw	And what are you going to buy?
qy	Well, have you been listening to Iacocca's arguments that Chrysler products are the only ones that all have air bags?
qy	Does that make a difference to you?
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
qy	did you see the,
qy	Did that scare you a little bit? With the lady being thrown out and run over.
sd	that a little more than scared me,
nn	no,
sd	the problem is I'm really into cars,
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah,
sd	they were forced to go,
sd	We have a van, that, just has seat belts in the back doesn't have a shoulder harness
^h	I have an Arrow Star van,
sd	we like it,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	did you, did you go to Florida in a van?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qw	what kind was it?
sv	what was remarkable, this van, even with, the,
sd	actually I grew up in Alabama,
sd	you know, it's been four years ago,
sd	But it has a big engine,
sd	And that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates.
sv	Well, you know, the big vans are all, real nice,
b	yeah.
b	All right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	you'd be surprised if you drive one of the, the mini vans,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
ny	Yeah.
sv	Well you can, you can, install those mirrors,
sv	and they're really nice,
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, they have got, some of the newer ones you know, with the aerodynamic features,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Ford now announced I think in ninety two, they're going to put, air bags in their vans.
sv	and I think, I believe safety,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	It would be that would do to our insurance rates, you know, if, if the insurance companies says we're not going to pay, you know, a claim, if the car doesn't have, air bags.
sv	that wouldn't be fair
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
sv	I think we've probably spent a reasonable amount of time.
fc	It was good talking to you,
fc	Okay.
qw	What do you do?
bk	Okay,
ba	that's good.
sv	that was wild .
sd	But I exercised real good for a couple of years.
br^m	what's my motivation?
sd	A friend of mine, always pushing me.
sd	I just wanted to look good,
aa	Yeah,
sd	I don't think women look good with muscles.
sd^r	Up to a point,
sv	It's just some of those women that come up there looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger's sister just doesn't get it.
sd	I guess it's a task 'cause I can't make myself do it lately.
b	Yeah.
sv	You don't want to lose yourself.
qw	Well how old are you?
bk	Okay,
sd	We all are,
sv	It's not hard to stay,
sd	I mean she was standing just as straight and tall
sd	she didn't have that at all.
sd	so she may be keeping that on purpose,
b	Uh huh .
sv	Well smoking ages you quick,
sd	it puts those little wrinkles around your lips.
^2	You get winded.
sd	I smoke a pack a day
sd	I can't quit smoking,
sd	I can't quit smoking.
aa	Yeah.

^2	Exercise.
sd	Well that's what my friend did.
ad	you can take those,
sd^m	Steroids,
sd	I was trying to say hemorrhoids, ,
aa	Yeah,
sd	I could just see hair start growing out of my upper lip or something.
bh	Really.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah .
b	yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	but I, I like jogging,
sv	If it's hot, you can't do that.
qy^g	But you can't ride your bike at all in the rain, can you.
sd	You slide.
b	Uh huh.
fc	Anyway, it's been nice talking to you.
ft	Thank you,
fc	All right,
b	Right.
sd	Right now I'm in college
sd	and so my budget comes from my dad's help.
sd	He helps me out a lot
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
ba	That sounds good.
b	Right.
ba	Well, that's good.
ba	Well, good.
sv	With two kids, that could be hard.
ba	Four!
ba	my goodness.
ba	my goodne ,
sd	It's just me and my sister.
sd	And my parents divorced three years ago
sd	and my sister had gotten through college,
sd	and then, before the divorce she had saved for my college.
sd	But, when we had the divorce, she just didn't get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house.
sd	So now my dad's paying for all of my college of .
sd	And financial aid and scholarships.
sd	I'm a music major,
sd	I'm a sophomore.
na	Right,
na	it sure is.
sd	and I don't spend over that .
aa	sure,
nn	no,
sd	I don't plan on being a starving artist .
sd	That's why I'm in college .
na	Right .
sv	That's usually because they're not real educated.
sd	The starving ones.
sv	There's enough out there that if you're educated enough, then you can make money.
b	Right.
ba	Well, good,
fe	boy .
b	Yeah
sd	or co dependency, or, you know, fifty thousand things like John Bradshaw's books on, THE FAMILY and HOMECOMING and INNER CHILD, and so
sd	I read usually that kind of stuff.
sd	in my spare time with a two and a half and a three and a half year old , I read .
b	Yeah.
sv	You know, but, gosh it's getting pathetic now .
b	Yeah.
sv	Later you're, probably looking for your kids
b	Yeah.
br	You do?
qw	What kind of books?
ba	 my goodness.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
br	No?
sv	That sounds so familiar.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	 that sounds interesting.
sv	I thought that was going to be some ,
ba	my goodness.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
^2	Then you were important .
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, that's interesting.
ba	Gosh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	But, he's got quite a collection of those.
ba	Hey,
b	You know, really.
b	yeah.
sv	but there's a surprising number that are still around that don't have those,
h	but, I'm trying to think of what else I've got.
sd	so I'm trying to get more familiarized with that because I refer clients and different groups
^h	I have a love affair with John Bradshaw.
sd	And then the third one that he came out with is now called HOMECOMING .
sv	 he's just great.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
sd	But, I definitely have gotten a lot out of his lately .
sv	And she's got some fabulous workbooks out and a whole series of tapes and, a workbook called BREAKING FREE, and just some real, helpful, practical things for co dependency.
sd	So that's been another one that I've thought was real helpful. But, other than that, my reading centers on PADDINGTON BEAR, and WINNIE THE POOH, and , DOCTOR SEUSS .
sd	But, I really have enjoyed exploring children's literature because there's so much more, new things out that, you know,
aa	I know.
sv	and they go through them so fast, you know.
sd	So I really have been going to the library and getting my ten books out
sv	So, that has been fun to do that {D you, know, } go through the children's literature, and, ,
b	Uh huh.
ba	wonderful.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qw	how, is recycling done in your community?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Oh.
sv	So it's nice to have, you know, one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	so I guess that's one option.
sd	I guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too.
qy	have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods, they have this little number now that tells what kind of plastic it is?
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	So I guess that makes it easy to recycle
b	Right.
qw	Where does your friend go to to recycle?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	I guess that's how it gets passed on. You know, when one person, you hear from another person
sv	and then and then you pass it on.
sv	It seems to be catching on, slowly but surely, I guess .
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, when you start early, I guess,
o	Yes.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Well, as I look at our trial systems,
sv	I think he should.
sv	and I think that it's important to have a jury, but I think the way that they go through so much time to get it a fair one.
qo	How do you feel about that?
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sv	And that would give them, experience in the courtroom,
sv	and it could count as some aspect or hours going into their major.
b	Right.
sd	I have a girlfriend that just went through a three year trial,
sd	And this expensive, big company that owned these motorcycles, railroaded this into three years worth of trials for this lady
sd	and they were following him home in the car. Saw the whole thing happen.
na	That's right.
sd	And they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials, this and that and the other.
sd	Until finally they won and, said that it was the drunk driver's fault
sd@	and she would have to sue him. * needs slash unit Which I would think it would be some his fault,
sv	but I just felt like justice wasn't served because they had the money, the big lawyers, and she didn't,
b	Right.
b	Right.
sv	And I don't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge didn't have the final say.
ng	not very often.
aa	Right.
ny	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
b	Right.
b	yeah.
sv	Which is what they want.
sd(^q)	I think a lot of people go in debt because they think, you know, I can just charge it,
sv	they, make the mistake of, pushing all their cards .
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	so after that I decided, well, I'm not going to use them at all, and just try to pay cash for everything
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	But now, it's punch money, because
na	right.
b	Yeah.
fc	Yeah.
fc	Bye.
^h	Well, I was just trying to think.
sd	And we subscribe to C N N
sd	And we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current, especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here.
sd	We have little ones.
sv	and we think that's kind of informative to teach them, how to handle things in situations.
qw	What do you watch?

bk	Okay.
ba	no.

bk	I see.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I mean, they are really in a crisis.
sd	And a lot of them they put out on parole
sv	I think that could be true too.
sv	I think the whole parole thing, you know, if somebody is convicted of second degree murder or something gets fifteen years, well, they are out in six or seven. You know, outbound on the streets again .
sv	And to me that's really scary.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^m	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
aa	Right,

b	Yeah.
b	th , Oh , yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	And, she said that, that, you know, he used to always keep his guns locked up and everything like that
aa	Right.

sd	They add it on to tires and gasoline, cigarettes, liquor.
sv	it's attacking just certain people.
sv	Even with the gasoline tax.
b	No.
qo	What are your feelings on it?
aa	Yeah.
aa	No,
sv	So, I mean, you can't believe what you hear.
b	Oh.
aa	I agree
sv	They're still people starving people here / * They're > There're
aa	Absolutely.
sv	so many billions of dollars here and there and everything

aa	Exactly.
sv	Prices went sky high.
bf	by the time you get through with the, the penalties.
aa	I agree.
sv	the, typical bureaucratic, I guess. that's one of my pet peeves.
sv	Very simple.
sv	I mean, you think about it now,
aa	It sure is.
sd	Well, I remember,
sv	But, government is ridiculous.
ad	Just think of the money they could save.
qh	Why not get the work out of the people.
sv	And, well, anyway that would, of course, eventually come back to taxes.
aa	very true.
sv	And then they tell you to, well, invest it in, is it I R A s or something
sv	and the tax is a lot less.
sv	But in the mean time you've got your money tide up in a relatively low interest bearing investment.
sv	me I'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it.
qy	Well, you, well, do you need some help spending yours?
bk	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
co	let me ask you something.
qy^d	You did?
sd	everybody I've talked to has received one
fc	well, anyway Ellen, it was nice talking to you.
fc	And, until next time.

sd	You know, that's what I really.

sd	and I assumed you know, it was from the switchboard.
b	Yeah
sd	and, you know, the policeman's associations.
sd	I used to do that.

b	Yeah,
ba	That's good,
sd	Well, normally I like to go out fishing in a boat, rather than like bank fishing, just like to try and catch anything that's swimming, because I've had such problems with trying to catch any type of fish, that, I just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing.

sd	So they found a place nearby that they put her in last year.
ny	yeah,
ny	Well, yeah,
sd	And she got kind of fearful of being on her own.
sd	and she didn't eat.
sd	Well, she was almost ridiculous.
bh	really?
sd	Well she didn't want to cook for herself anymore.
^q	that's too much trouble.
b	Yeah.
sd	Although they've got, Meals On Wheels, Which I understand is a really good, you know, way to handle that so that at least they eat.
nn	No,
sd	she was ambulatory
sd	But, I remember from her checking around, she ended up staying at the Arkansas House I think out in Arlington, something like that.
sd	And, you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that share a, bathroom. All of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items .
sd	They're always saying that somebody's going to,
sd	but, at least they all seem to have, you know, people that monitor their, medication intake and dining facilities, you know, go to the dining room and eat some good meals.
sd	I know when my friend's mother in law first went in, I mean, very antisocial.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	it seems like the women just out live their husbands, but, very reluctantly,
sv	they don't get out of the house,
sv	But it's so lonely,
sd(^q)	because I think, what do you have there?
sd	it's walls
qh	Don't you want to be close to me? . I mean, you know be with other people.
sd	I just don't understand why they, so much want to just stay in that building.
sd	And there's no family there,
b	Yeah.
sd	That's from the child's standpoint.
^q	What does that house got attraction?
sd	I know they're really proud of independence.
qw	Well, when she got home, who took care of her?
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	So we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here.
sv	And they really don't have an excess of catchers
sd	They're not the highest paying ball team around.
sd	But you know, I would, I would gladly take the salary of most of the guys, I'll tell you.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I'll have to admit I kind of went more to see the other team a lot of times than I did the Rangers,
sv	But, I think they're doing better.
b	Yeah,
sv	I think it's more fun to play than it is to watch.
b	Yeah.
aa	of course,
sd	and he pitched yeah, five full innings.
o	no big deal, you know,
sv	He's something else,
sv	They could do very well,

b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	no.
b	 Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, you know, I have noticed too that, when I started not the exercise but the walking program, that I did tone up, you know, like all over,
sd	but it didn't get the upper part of my body,
sd	so, what I do, is I bowl.
sv	so, I really loved it,
sd	and I still bowl at least once a week now, on a league, on a,
sd	but I've noticed that what I do is that I have my towel that sits on the floor, so that every time I get up to bowl, I have to bend over to pick up my towel
sd	I'm always explaining to people, I do little things like that, like, you know, take the stairs instead of the elevator,
sv	and, I do silly things like that versus a regular program that you would have.
aa	It sure does.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's true.
aa	No,
sd	and then I would do them like two times a day,
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
^2	that's enough.
b	yes.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
aa	It does,

aa	There you go,
fc	Well, it was nice talking to you.
fc	Yeah,
fc	Bye bye.
qy	Do you work for T I?
bk	Oh.
bk	okay.
sd	It used to just be for new employees.
sd	They, randomly select employee numbers
sd	So, we're familiar with it.
b	Well, yeah,
nn	No,
na	Right.
sv	Well, what they be testing for are the ones that would have like, you know, barbiturates or codeine things like that in them.
aa	Right,
aa	Right,
sd	you probably put down, you know, you had Drixoral or Contact if you would remember that you did it.
nn	No.
sv	But if they had a controlled substance, maybe they would ask you then to show that you had that prescription in your name.
sd	and they test them too even if you are not a real, T I er.
sd	And he had taken some kind of, you know,
sd	Well, I keep trying to get away from them,
qo	What about you?
b	Uh huh.
b	, okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.

b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
br	Service charge you mean?
bf	Yearly fee,
sd	you get that stuff in the mail all the time.
sd	What I really hate in the mail is like for the credit cards that I do have still, that they send you these things that look like checks,
sd	and they say, hey, you know, two thousand dollars, you know, free to you kind of thing, you know,
sd	I can't believe they have the nerve to do that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	But we're not into that.
sv	Well, we're geared to that.
sd(^q)	people go, well, I'll just go put it on credit and they'll pay it off.
sv	People aren't tuned in to like saving for it and then buying it,
nn	, no,
ny	Yeah,
sv	That's, a lot of money that you went to buy this item.
sv	And then you never feel like you've got anything to put into savings or anything,
fp	Yes,
sd	Well, just go ahead and talk,
ny	Yeah.
ng	I don't think so.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes,
ny	Uh huh.
b	Good.
na	That's better.
ba	that's really good.
b	Yeah.
sd	I don't do any of that.
no	Well, he's giving me an estimate.
sv	And for ten dollars a week, I don't see any reason for me to be doing it.
o@	No, for my yard. * needs slash unit Yeah,
sd	he is.
b^m	Yeah,
sv	It's like next to nothing.
sd	But if there's five weeks, I still pay forty.
sd	Well, he won't pull weeds.
sd	he won't cut them is what he won't do. Because he said with the rocks that it's too dangerous for him to take the trimmer over the rocks
sv	and he's right.
sv	That's true.
nn	No.
sd	I started to pull the weeds in the rocks out front
sd	and all of a sudden I came cross this big clump of weeds
sd	and I threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there
sd	I would rather a snake,
sd	I just left the whole thing.
sd	I haven't gone back over there.
ny	yeah,
no	I don't know.
sd^r	I don't know,
sv	and I thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather.
sv	They looked real pretty until about a week before Christmas,
sv	So, I don't think any of it comes back
sv	maybe these,
ny	Yeah.
bh	Really?
ba	Well, that's good.
sv	they're like indestructible.
sv	We'll see.
sd	But that's because we didn't hit one for a long time.
sv	I hope not .
b	Yeah,
sd	where was the person last night was from far away.
sd	And we get each other down the street.
b	Yeah,
sd	I can't remember,
sd	And I don't remember what the place was last night,
sd	but I'm not sure
sd	But mostly they're from the area.
aa	Not for me.
sd	You know, not not for me because all I have is rocks and weeds.
sd	I know.
sd	I know,
no	I don't know,
no	I don't know.
sd	I know.
qo	So, how's the baby, do you think ?
qw	How's the,
ad	Let's talk about the baby.
ad	Let's talk about the Middle East situation.
sd	Now it's all over with, you know.
sd^m	I don't know
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
aa	No,
b	Right.
sv	I think it's such a shame that the Iraqis had to just go destroy everything.
qh	I mean, what good is that?
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
^2	The, The deal with the supporting the Kurds.
b	Right,
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
bf	Maybe supply some arms or something.
b	Yeah,
sv	and Saddam Hussein miscalculated all along, thinking that he wouldn't commit U S lives and forces and monies just to liberate a little country.
sv	And, then he underestimated his ability to wage a war with us.
sv	And that was a horrible miscalculation.
sd	Not any more .
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sv	and I think the people were smart enough to realize that,
sv	Someone is going to assassinate him, you know.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
sd	And you just can't do it and get away with it, you know, hoping that you know,
sv	because it's a world thing
ny	yeah.
bf	had no teeth.
b	Right.
sd	I guess, I feel sorry for just the average, you know, Iraqi, who has had to go through all of this and the suffering. I'm sure with no water, No electricity, no sanitation,
sv	living conditions must be terrible.
sv	and it's not getting any better,
sd	You know, except for a few medical supplies they are allowing through now and then powdered milk, I guess, for babies and things
sd(^q)	and the Kuwaitis said, We don't want to have to repay Israel for all the bombing that we did that was in there, you know.
sv	But that's only fair.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	It's going to be really tough for them to swallow,
sv(^q)	And we don't want, you know, to be stabilized to the point where Iran will say, Now is our chance, you know, to go in and wipe them out
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sv	Not quite as radical a stance, more moderates are in power now.
b	Yeah.
sv	And yet so many of the citizens are the Lebanese. Who were hoping this would evolve into a war against Israel. And trying to connect with Israel all that time
sv	and there really was no connection at all.
sd(^q)	but boy those Lebanese in Jordan, they were saying you know, this whole war is Israel's fault because Israel told the United States to attack Iran
b	Right,
sv	They just hate,
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Well, I, we're going to compare notes.
sd	I often desire to exercise, often believe I should and rarely do.
qw	what, what sort of regiment do you have?
b	Yes.
b^r	Yes.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yes.

b	Yes.
b^r	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I, whenever I do it, I feel good. I mean good that I have done, good because it seems right and good because it has good effects.
sd	but it's this maintaining a regular habit that I just can't seem to do.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yep.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b^r	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qw	what, what, what's on, what's this mat, I mean,
qy	Is it like the sort of thing you take on a camping trip and sleep on it.
qy^d	I mean, it's that kind of like half inch of foam or something.
b^m	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yes,
qy	Did you get to vote at the last one?
b	uh huh,
b	Right,
b	Right.
sv	and also they're fed up with the system,
b	Right.
aa	Right.
b	I know it .
h	So I don't know,
ny	Yeah,
sv	You know, we get this lackadaisical attitude,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
^q	You know, I like what he says,
qy^g	And, I think that's sort of what happened with Louisiana because, the guy did get elected, correct?
sd	That's what I thought.
sv	, but you know, they can always fool us, you know.
b	yeah.
sd	What we do, usually, is, vote, absenteeism
sd	and, I know, here, you know, you don't have to have any reason,
sd	and the polls are open, what was it, a couple of weeks,
sd	And so we've got plenty of time to go, because down here in Houston, the lines are long.
sd	Well, I recommend it, because you just walk right on in, and there's usually not anybody in line
sd	and, you know, that vote's just as good as, you know, the one on election day.
b	Uh huh,
b	yeah,
sd	you know, the views, and, you know, everybody gets to vote on, you know, well, should he be for this and on and on and on,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	But, if it, gets down between two, then I'll vote for the party because I know, you know, something about the other guy
sv	or, you know, they're both just as bad,
sv	But it gets to the point where,
b	Right,
sd	I don't agree with how the media handles elections.
sd	you know, I'm tired of hearing about the polls, you know, you know,
sv	it's just ridiculous.
aa	Uh huh,
b^m	Yeah,
aa	They really do.
aa	yes,
aa	No,
fc	All right.
fc	Bye bye.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Great.

aa	No.
qw	How often do you meet?
b	yes,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
sv	And, we were a little bit too frequent I think.
sd	I don't remember if we were once a month
sv	It's too rich.
sd	And, so, we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day.
sd	and then one of the couples, moved
b	yeah,
sd	so that's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese.
sd	well, I take that back.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	wow.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	sure I do too.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	And I did a cop out on to it
sd	and I have to make hors d'oeuvres
sd	so, I'm buying the little tiny rolls and so on.
^2	Those people that try to do everything.
ba	Ugh .
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
ba	they do.
sv	or if you do buy it, it's extremely expensive.
sd	And I've never been there before. And found that there's, individual vendors
sd	and the foods are wonderful.
sd	And it's like thirteen fifty for a whole strawberry cheesecake. which is really not such a bad price.
sd	but I was very tempted because it looked wonderful,
sd	but those are homemade.
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	We like hot food too,
b	Right.
sd	I thought, I thought, that there was a slight difference in accent.
b	Right.
qy	do you have a favorite hors d'oeuvre recipe that's easy
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b^m	All week.
sd	and, you know, we're eating it for a week and a half,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
b	Right.
sd	I have a great recipe for sour cream chicken enchiladas
sv	it's really good,
sd	and, every time I've served it, everybody just loves it.
sd	So that's one of my favorite things to make.
qo	What about you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Ooh,
b^m	Is done,
b	Yeah,
sd	I've got a great recipe for cheese cake.
qy^d	I don't know if you get SOUTHERN LIVING,
sd	they have one,
sd	and, you know, every month they've got all different kinds of recipes,
sd	but inside the cheese cake, recipe you put, lemon peel and orange peel
sd	so sometimes I'll do that overnight, and then put the topping on the next day,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	No ,
b	Right.
aa	It does,
b	Right .
na	sometimes,
sd	I've been to, you know, some wine tastings up in Napa Valley
sd	you know, and I learned a little bit about them then,
b	yeah,
bk	okay,
sd	and then you get to eat everything afterwards,
sv	and it sounds like it's a lot of fun.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
fp	Hello.
fp	Hello,
sd	well I'm glad you found me.
ny	Yes.
aa	Okay.
aa	I think they are, too.
sd	But, I would love to just take some scissors and cut them in half.
sv	I think sometimes when you look at the interest that you're paying on them, that's what gets to be the really scary part, you know, if you think, when it comes around to income tax time, and you look at how much money you paid out just in interest all year,
aa@	That's right.* needs slash unit note punctuation Yeah,
sv(^q)	and it's just easier to say, you know, just put that on my credit card.
sv	and then it seems like takes forever to pay that off.
ba	Wow.
aa	It sure is.
sd	We haven't done it lately.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	no.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And, if you could stick to that, you know, we'd get rid of a lot of indigestion and everything else.
ba	dear.
b	Uh huh.
sv	You know, one thing you might do with, in a situation like that, though, it's just like keep,
b	Uh huh.
sd	You know, I have quite a collection myself
sd	but I don't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either
ba	I believe that.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah
aa	You know. Yeah.
b	Yeah .
aa	Yeah,
aa	No
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	See in California they, In California they make you register when you buy ammunition.
sd	You have to sign a, you know,
sv	now rifles aren't too bad,
b	Uh huh.
ba	Gee.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	No.
sv	You know, I think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit, course,
aa	Yeah,
sv	It would definitely be gun control .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
ar	They're not, you know,
sd	well I did in the service but you know, not on the street
aa	No,
sd	I don't,
sd	I have a good time with them
b	Yeah.
aa	Probably.
aa	No,
b	Yeah.
sd	You know I've taken time to teach them
sd	so he started with the B B gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows
b	Uh huh.
b	All right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	All right.
sd	You know, I don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away,
aa	Yeah,
fc	All right,
fc	Bye bye .
nn	No,
sv	that's pretty average to me .
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	that's how I camp too.
sv	the rest of that is really not the same.
sd	As a matter of fact, my, you know, the majority of the amount of camping I've done has been really roughing it.
ny	Yes,
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	the kids love it.
sv	I mean, they just love it.
aa	Exactly.
sv	really is a, is a good family thing, to do.
b^m	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Good planning .
aa	Exactly.
aa	You're right.
bh^m	No?
t1	well, actually, you know what I would love?
sv	That doesn't go along with camping,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And I would play on the beach area too.
sd	That's what I would do.
b^m	Yeah.
sv	I'm just sitting here listening to your accent and thinking what a good time the computer is going to have with that.
na	You're pretty Texan.
sd	I've only lived here about six years.
sv	So, i , if I have one, it must be very, very slight.
sv	The Yankees can hear it.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Oh.
ba	Well, good for you.
qy^d	I'm wondering, I'm really not that not familiar.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It takes a lot more planning.
b	Uh huh.
nn	No,
ba	that sounds, That sounds great.
qy	Have you ever camped out of state?
ad	You know, where you should try, sometime is Colorado.
sv	It is beautiful.
na	Absolutely beautiful.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
ad	See, you need to go there.
sd	It's, you know, it's, it's high canyon
sd	And, in the early fall time,
sd	I can't remember what type of trees they are,
sd	and it's just brilliant.
aa	Yes,
sv	I know you would.
sd	I was too .
b	Yeah.
sd	well we did, you know,
sv	It's not camping.
aa	Right,
b	Right.
nn	No,
ft	thank you.
sd	I think I haven't been able to do it,
sd	And I'm a little bit fearful of trying that just women.
qy	You know?
sd	I hope,
aa	Yes,
sd	and that was great.
sd	and, you know, I stayed in a nice place.
b	You know.
sv	I'm just a chicken.
sd	I haven't quite adjusted, you know?
ng	So, well it's, It was a good plan but I haven't yet .
sd	I got into sales,
sd	And it's fun
ny	So, yeah,
sd	Eleven and fourteen.
b	Yeah.
co	Well, excuse me just second.
t3	Honey, I'll be wi ,
nd	Well, I'm going to listen.
b	Yeah
sd	I haven't made any.
sd	I think I've had about four.
b	yeah.
sd	That's four each.
sd	and it's like virtually anything.
sd	And it's been real interesting, the different personalities . That I run across.
aa	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
fc	Well, thank you.
fc	You have a good time camping,
fc	All right.
fc^m	Bye bye.
sd	Well, I don't know, I'm thinking about from one to ten what my no would be.
sv	But, I believe, I think the N R A has gone overboard the wrong way. You know,
sv	they're sitting there on number ten,
sv	Because there has got to be some kind of background check to see, that the people who are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose, you know, if you're going to hunt with it, or if you're going to do sport shooting you can wait a week.
sv	It's not a big deal for them to go.
sv	any of that kind of stuff.
sv	If the gun shop owner does it,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
sv	that's the kind of people,
sv	and the people who want it, it's not that big a deal, like I say, to wait.
aa	Yeah,
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
ba	Gosh,
sv	Too many people have too much access.
sv	and, I think, the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is, there should be some law against the types of gu ,
sv(^q)	basically it says here buy me and go rob a seven eleven
aa	yes
sv	Or your child accidently.
sv	If your child is old enough,
sv	that's the truth.
sv	You can't ,
sv	Because there's been kids that age who have killed people.
sd	And, you know, you know, there was a law I think it's in Oregon, where they've now made all toy guns,
b	You know like, yeah,
sd	My kid didn't care.
sd	He picks up a stick and goes bang.
sd	It doesn't make any difference to him.
b	Yeah .
aa	Yeah,
sv	You know, so that they're not very distinguishable from a real gun.
sv	That's kind of ,
h	I don't know.
sv	I think that's a lot of it too, is that people need to teach their kids, what to do and what not to do.
sd	Because my Dad started letting me shoot like a little air B B gun, when I was probably five or six years old.
^q	this is how you hold
^q	and you don't ever touch it unless I'm here,
sd	then they went to the Texas Parks and Recreation, I guess,
sd	I think it started in about nineteen seventy.
sd	if you want to go deer hunting
sd	or you can't get a deer license.
sd	and it, it's basic stuff,
^q	and then you crawl over it, and shoot yourself.
sv	And, those things happen.
sd	it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
sd	I took the clip out, or whatever
b	Oh.
b	yeah.
^2	Don't even think about it,
b	Yeah,
sv	not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared about.
sv	if it's just one more piece of something,
b	Yeah.
sd	and then the shells are in another part
sd(^q)	And, I was like, I live in a nice neighborhood,
sd	and then I've got it so far,
sd	and it's in a case,
sd	but, I don't want to take the chance
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
aa	I know,
sd(^q)	It was like, you come after me, you're going to get it. you know,
sd	and now there's so many other things, where are the kids, what are they doing, you know, where is this person coming in from,
sv	and then, you know, how can you even afford to think about what you're going to do because you don't know where your kids are, at the same time.
b	Ugh.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Unfortunately,
fc	Yeah,
fc	we're in pretty good agreement actually on it.
fc	it would be even more interesting you to be some of these people who are at the other end of the spectrum.
fc	Me too.
fc	Well, it's been nice talking to you.
fc^m	Bye bye. .
b	yes.
sd	Well, I was from Illinois originally,
sd	And we had some wonderful, wonderful years there under Roger Staubach .
sd	We expected it to continue forever.
ng	I think two.
sd	I know they lost, yeah, to Washington and Philadelphia.
aa	Yeah,
sd(^q)	People running up saying, what's the score, what's the score?
na	That's right
sd	I had forgotten
b	Yeah.
sv	That's exactly where both of the wives came from I think.
sv	it's easier to join them than fight them.
sv	And if you want to see them, you might just as well enjoy football.
sd(^q)	And I used to tease my husband sometimes and say, my gosh did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited about, these games.
sv	Well, it takes a little brainwashing first.
b	Yeah.
qy	Are you, transit usually?
sv	Well, it will take you a little while
aa	I know.
sv	But, Dan Reeves is a pretty neat guy anyway.
aa	Yeah,
sd	he was one of our boys.
sd	So we never cheer against Denver unless they're playing the Cowboys.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^m	Johnny Elway.
sv	Well, there is so much about it to like.
aa	You know it's so exciting.
sd	And when the Cowboys won the Superbowl here, of course, they put together some real cute songs,
b	Uh huh.
qw^t	How should they do it?
sd	Well, I'm all for it.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sv	I think they you know, start, just go all the way on new products introduced or whatever, you know, start your packaging, go to liters instead of quarts,
na	They do,
sv	But if they started putting it in liters, of oil, and you know, liters of gasoline, people are going to learn to think in metric.
ba	It figures.
b	Right.
ba	that's the problem.
aa	Right.
sd	but by the time I was in fifth or sixth grade anyway.
sv	I would expect people with any kind of buying power you know, under the age of thirty or so, to have some idea what it is, anyway.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, thing is, it's a global market place these days,
^2	Something.
h	I don't, you know,
na	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
sd	And it got to, you know,
nn	No.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	It's getting warm, right.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Is about twice as much, what it works out to.
sd	One point eight times as many points.
sv	so. I think as long as people have a choice, they're going to stick with the American way.
sv	And until we have to learn to think that way, we won't.
ny	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	Right.
ba	that would be a mess.
aa	Right.
sv	Because you're never going to get to one system if you still got a mix.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv(^q)	Every road sign you come to, is like, well I don't know it that far.
aa	Yeah,
sv	At that time, anyway, that was still when things were,
sv	You know, now cars, they have both.
b	Yeah.
qy^h	What am I afraid of?
sd	I don't know if I'm really afraid of spending too much.
sv	and you know, everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I have two little ones.
ny	Yeah.
sd	four and two and half.
aa	Yes.
nn	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	You're right.
b	Yeah.
sv	Your defeating the purpose.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
aa	Yes.
b	Yeah.
sv	And, then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah
fc	you too.
fc	Bye bye.
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
ba	no .
qw	How much was the alternator?
qy	did he hook up the wiring wrong?
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
sd	Well I had a weird,
sd	this little sensing device costed like sixty bucks .
sd	and I haven't had too many problems with my car,
sd	and then, you know just basic maintenance and oil changes
sv	so after buying the filter and all the oil, you're looking at ten bucks at least, or somewhere in there and, and then to go to the trouble, that I figured it's easier spending eighteen bucks at Jiffy Lube.
sd	as far as any maintenance on my car, I shy away from the oil changes,
qw	How did you put that many miles on it, in, four or five years?
qy	a hundred and forty mile trip?
bf	thirty five miles each way.
b^m	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Okay.
qw^h	I was going to ask you, you know, as far as how we're getting compensated for what we're doing right now,
qw^d	and, I just wondering how I go about getting the cash .
bk	okay.
aa	Okay.
aa	Okay,
sd	And, I've done it maybe twelve times.
sd	Well I don't know if I've done it quite that much,
b	Uh huh.
b	well.
b	Yeah,
sd	the body was in good condition
sd	you know, after about thr , couple of months after I was out of college I finally splurged and bought my car
aa	Yeah,
sv	And they last a long time.
sv	It almost costs so much to fix anything or do anything with it,
b	Okay.
qy^h	you found that out tonight?
^h	I haven't even heard that,
sd	But, there are some others out there that I don't believe deserve the money they're getting.
aa	yeah.
ny	Yeah,
^h	But I think, let's see,
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Threw it away .
ba	gosh.
no	I played softball.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
na	Every once in a while I like to go on the nights when there's not very many people out there.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
aa	It is.
b	Yeah,
sd	that's in, Texas stadium where the football players, play
sd	and they're never going to let liquor in there.
aa	I know,
sd	But, that new stadium's going to be real nice,
sd	And it's going to go to the highest bidder .
b	Oh.
sd	God . I stay away from them.
ba	I bet you do.
bh	you are?
qw	what's he teach?
b	Uh huh.
bh	you do?
qy	Is that a tough system to be in?
qy	Real hard?
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	That's typical bureaucracy though.
h	I don't know,
b	Yeah,
sv	but the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes.
qh	You don't even know who to payoff, .
b	Yeah,
qy^d	No communication whatsoever.
b	Yeah.
aa	I know.
qy^d	And you never see it.
ba	That's got to be frustrating.
qw	How long you taught in Dallas schools?
sv	that's about, ten too many.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
ba	well, that's not bad.
qy	But hasn't it changed a lot over the years?
ny	Yeah.
qy^d	Or working in the system.
ba	God .
ba	How funny.
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
qw^t	So, how long are we suppose to talk for?
bh	you can?
sd	I haven't ever talked that long.
b	Uh huh .
qy	He lives in Cleveland?
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah.
na	yours is my second one.
qy	did she, did you all not talk about the topic at all?
bk	Oh.
sd	the one I talked about the other night was good,
sd	Me, too, because we go all the time,
sd	So, that was real good to talk about that.
ad	You've got to go see that.
b	Yeah,
sd	I did, too.
b	Yeah.
qw	And, how old are your kids?
ad	You probably don't want to take them to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
ba	I bet they do.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	yeah,
sv	well heck, that's a lot cheaper then, taking them out to the show.
sv	Especially if you get them for a couple of nights you don't have to watch them all in one time.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's true.
aa	That's true.
sd	It was okay,
ng	Not very much,
sd	I don't have the patience to read .
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
bh	really?
qw	Who is the author?
bk	Oh .
b^m	Shoeless Joe.
bk	Okay.
b	Right.
sd	I didn't,
na	I think so .
qw	What is it that you are, you know, particularly upset about?
b	Uh huh.
bf	So you're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of, real estate or other taxes
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	Right.
sv	it means that you've got to be informed
b	Right.
aa	Right.
sd	Well I'm glad that you added that one.
aa	Right.
b	Oh .
sd	after our last summer's vacation I am antibeach.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, we were out visiting one of our kids in Maryland,
sd	And, the waves were huge.
sd	and, I was standing in water not more than, barely above my ankles
sv	and, you know when the waves go in the waves go out they kind of all of a sudden you're in sand above your ankles.
sd	And I was standing there talking to my daughter
sd	So I'm never going to another beach again, ever.
sd	Well, I love to go and play around.
sd	that's my biggest gripe about living here.
sd	And I basically, don't want to go to a hot place on vacation .
b	Oh.
sd	This is just someplace I've always wanted to go
sd	and someday I hope we can afford to just take a humdinger of a vacation up there.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and we've been talking about going there next summer .
sd	It's been a long time.
sd	we usually go up to Wisconsin at least once a year because this is where my husband and I are both from.
sd	And my mother and his mother live up there feeling lost and alone because we moved down here .
sd	And, we've got one of our kids lives out on the east coast
aa	Well, I know
sd	I want to go someplace different up there.
sv(^q)	my idea I guess of the ideal vacation would be to begin with, money be no object. You know, so just absolutely, you know, first class fly where I want to, rent a car if I want to. you know, just really the nicest hotels and stuff like that and and not worry if somebody says, well, let's take this little side trip, you know, and not have to sit there and figure out, you know, again we fit that in there or not.
sd	And, that's what I, you know, that's what I would like to do.
sv	To me why somebody would want to ride around on a boat for a few days is mind boggling.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh .
h	But, I don't know
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
sd(^q)	and our standard excuse for not going someplace like that is, you know, gee, Holly would starve to death if you know, we took her into the country
sv	so . So, but I would like if, you know it was anywhere in the world to go, I guess, even though it's hot,
sd	I would like to go to Africa.
qw	Well, how much do you like lawn and garden work?
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but I still take care of the, you know, flower beds and things like that.
sd	and I was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me,
sd	so the hibi , hibiscus plants no longer exist .
sd	And I really feel bad about it,
sd	So, they're all gone at this point.
sd	and, Texas is just so hot in the summer and so dry,
sd	And so with that, why, our lawns do stay, you know, pretty nice all summer, if you water.
sd	But in the winter, we have Bermuda grass
sd	and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack
sv	and I just think it's ugly .
aa	Uh huh,
aa	Yeah.
sd	but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer.
sd	They have to water an incredible amount.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes,
ny	Yes,
h	I don't know.
br	What?
nn	No,
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh .
sd	You know, a kit.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
aa	I'll bet.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	That you dial in on the side.
b	Uh huh.
qw	How strong is it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	Big solid pieces of oak are just tough.
nd	Well, that was, you know, with a circular saw.
ba	Like, my gosh.
qh	Is this going to be fun ?
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I like, classical, and, sort of, popular rock type music.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yep.
b	Yep,
b	Oh.
^h	Yeah.
sd	It's mostly just the tunes.
aa	Yeah,
ba	I know,
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Yes?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yes.
sd	now, you don't have to wait till the hour mark.
sd	and, you get the latest news and everything.
b	So, yeah.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yep.
sd	I like to listen to tapes, of music or, or, stuff on a long trip.
sv	And, now you can even get books on tape,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ba	So, that's a lot of fun
aa	Yep.
aa	Yeah,
b	Right.
fc	Yep.
fc	All right.
fc	Thank you.
nd	Well, right now the place where I'm living, the yard was basically neglected for about the last twenty five years,
na	f , for three years.
sd	Killing lots of fire ants.
sd	Because it was like, you couldn't even stand still out there.
qy^c	Is this better?
sd	It was like you'd go out in the yard to water something, you'd just be standing still.
sd	And the ants would start crawling up your legs.
sd	Dursban Two.
sd	A chemical called Dursban Two,
sd	it's a crystal.
no	not bad.
sv	but that's, to be expected.
ng	as far as I can tell it hasn't killed anything it wasn't supposed to.
qy	you said you had problems with fleas last year in the yard?
sv	I found one thing that, it's kind of a weird thing to say to put out on the lawn,
sd	Powdered sulphur.
sd	you don't have to put a whole lot out,
sd	and it's real fine, like flour
sd	and you just go out, and do the entire yard,
sd	and I mean, you don't have to put clumps of it,
na	I love it.
^h	this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at. Sitting on about a two acre lot now,
na	the back half is my garden.
sd	in Missouri City.
sd	southwest side of Houston.
sd	Southwest Houston.
fc	no,
fc	Okay,
ny	Yes,
ny	Yeah.
sd	but in the winter it gets pretty cold.
b	yeah,
qo	how about yourself?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes,
sv	but it's like low impact aerobics, just with weights.
o	Okay,
ny	yes,
sv	that's the in thing.
sv	At first it was just regular aerobics,
sd	they call it a low impact aerobics,
sd	And from when I've done it, it does give you a real good workout.
sv	they seem to think that it won't,
ny	Yeah,
sd	But, I've kind of taken care of that.
sd	and, wearing that I haven't had any problems in the past year or so.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I mean, it would only take three or four days
qw	so how successful is your exercise video?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	So it's a good workout.
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, I do, real rough type camping.
ny	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
aa^r	They really are.
qo	How about you?
b	Uh huh.
ba	how great.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
aa	Well, that's true,
sd	I guess the last real, camping trip I took has been a couple years ago.
sd	I went to California up to the Sequoias.
ny	Yeah,
ny	Uh huh.
sv	But, that is God's country,
b^m	Yeah.
nn	no,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^m	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b^m	Yeah.
aa	Yeah ,
sd	And, course, the Sequoias and the Redwoods , and you get up into Bryce Canyon and Yellowstone
b	Yeah,
sd	Course, I guess I'm partial to big tree country.
sd	I don't know why I got stuck down here in Texas now .
nn	No ,
sd^e^r	Not around here .
aa	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
sd	And I was actually on the road a little more than three weeks.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Yep.
ny	Yeah,
ny	Uh huh,
sd	And then we went up the Big Sur Highway all the way up to San Francisco. and then cut across through the wine country. And then went down to, Sequoia National Park.
ny	yeah.
qy^t	so you pressed one?
bk	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Okay.
qw	like what?
b	Yeah,
sd	I have never read a lot of Faulkner.
ba	cool .
sd	I'm Doug,
nd	well, a bunch of stuff, I guess, fair number of novels, but mostly shorter ones.
qy	Right?
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
sd	But they were still very heavy and philosophical, also very funny.
sd	and, I read a lot of non fiction books, too.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Now what's that?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
bk	sh , .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It's all about how to have out of body experiences and all that.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	did you like it?
bk	Uh huh.
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
sd	you laugh.
qy^d	You've been through the fun part .
sd	I have a four and a half and a three.
sv	I'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way it's done now and then.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qw	What was the age difference between the youngest and the oldest?
qy	So they were all real close?
ba	That's tough.
qy	Did you both work? Your wife too?
ba	well, qualify that.
sd	well both my husband and I work
sd	Maybe thirty minutes max.
sd	And well he spends a lot of time with them while I'm cooking
aa	Well, I've accepted that too .
aa	That's true.
aa	Well, that's true
sd	If my husband golfs, you know, he'll do it during nap time, things like that where they're not really missing the presence, you know.
sd	and we do a lot of family things together.
sv	Well, I decided that, you know, you need that once in awhile. That you, you need to plan the quality time
b	Yeah.
b	Sure.
b^m	Yeah.
sd(^q)	My daughter's like, Mommy can I help you with the laundry?
aa	Absolutely.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Oh.
b	Yeah.
bf	So they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a head that week
b	Oh.
ba	I imagine.
ba	that's wonderful.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
ba	Now that's good.
qy^g	Whatever was voted on,
ba	Well I think that's great.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	I think that's true.
sd	And we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done you know.
sv	So I do think it's right that they're harder on themselves, you know.
qw	why is that?
no	well I don't know.
b	Uh huh,
qo	Well what about, required drug testing, as a, condition of employment?
sd	I, have worked at Texas Instruments.
sd	And, they instituted a Drug testing policy where they randomly would test, employees
sd	and actually, to tell you the truth, I really did not think much about it.
sv	And, also, this is against the law for the government to do this kind of big brother activity
sv	So what that means is, to me, that really it's the government that's requiring this,
qh	Well, what about this, AIDS epidemic now?
sv	and and, of course, the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesn't,
qo	So what about that as an invasion of privacy?
b	So really,
sv	Well, it's supposed to have been.
ar	No,
^2	A growing part.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Maybe chop their weenies off.
ny	yes
sv	I think that, we simply must start accepting everybody in the world.
sv	there just is not going to be room for all of us.
sd	I am one of the unemployed right now.
sv	And I know that there are a lot of foreigners, here, you know, doing my line of work.
sd	And, of course, I'm not perfectly happy about not having a job.
qo	So, how do you feel?
b	Right .
b	Okay
sv	And I think probably it's pretty important right there.
sv	Actually, actually I feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here.
sv	And it would have nothing to do with political situations.
ba	my gosh.
sv	Well, I mean and the two of them together.
sv	But there's some differences in the immigrants, that we're getting now.
aa	I think, probably a great deal of what you say is true about the legals.
sv	But, the majority of the illegal immigration we're getting now, they do not come here to blend into America.
sv	We send a lot of money to Mexico.
sd	I feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently.
sd	In that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than, by evidence that's presented.
sd	I was thinking primarily criminal cases.
ny	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	, too often I think they are not
sd	and, when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have you know that is a matter of concern to me too.
sv	I think that, in such cases, they are not really looking for unbiased people, but rather for biased.
sd	now I happen to know several judges
sd	but the other two I feel, would give either you know, the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law.
sd	And I guess that's what I am concerned with.
b	Uh huh.
aa	This is very true.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah
sv	but one individual got twenty five years
aa	Isn't that the truth ?
sd	goodness, my mind has gone blank it's, Othello.
sv	But, it's taken me a long time to understand that, lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice you know, as, as novices tend to think that, attorneys care about justice.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And they are very effective too.
sd	I have been involved, just slightly in a case where I know the person is guilty
sd	but, his attorneys gotten him off.
sd	the city has dropped their charges against him because the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge.
b	All right.
sd	My, mother was divorced in nineteen, fifty seven, when I was seven years old.
sd	And, I was the first one, of anyone that anyone had ever known, to have a divorce.
sv	Of course, now fifty percent divorces in the United States,
sd	And, they all felt that there was never an issue that my father was the cause of the reason for the split up, even though he had impregnated another woman and forced the divorce.
sd	it was always my mother's fault, she was not, sufficient, you know, she just was not good enough.
b	yeah
sv	so, {D you know, that's so changing,
sd	I was first generation going to college in my family.
sd	first, my mother had always had a quote career, but always a career as in a secretarial position.
sd	She was a secretary the jud , to, a circuit court judge, federal judge.
sd	And it was a lifetime appointment for her as well as for him.
sd	She made over thirty thousand, a year.
aa	Well, yeah,
ny	Yeah.
sd	hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back, you know.
sd	so I went to college and now since have completed two masters degrees
aa	Absolutely.
sd	Challenges that have to do with my sex.
sd	for instance, well, you know, I am just not taken as seriously, you know, at professions, as many of the men who are doing the same job I do.
sd	And, the choir members treat me differently because I am a woman, they expect me to be more motherly,
sd	So I am pretty ob , pretty cons , I mean, I am pretty aware of what goes on in the church.
sd	well I am done talking.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Indeed.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change, why they can not bend. I mean, why they can not just accept, you know, competent women,
aa	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	They, in their own peer relationships, they do not treat themselves equal,
sd	I think probably is as enlightened as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life time.
sd	those are the only issues we ever fight about.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
b	Right .
b	Right.
^2	Sunday.
sd	, I know here in Dallas that they have just instituted in the last couple of years, a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections.
nn	No .
b	really.
qy	To absentee vote specifically?
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
sv	But I do not think it is difficult enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first place, , or, who are not just motivated who really believe that they, their voice is heard.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really ?
sd	I don't understand that.
ar	Well, he did refute it.
sd	Well see, I, I didn't believe anybody would believe that either.
qh	Well, then how can a democracy work then?
qh	how can it work?
b	Right .
b	Right.
bh	What?
qo	Well, how about the reverse of that?
sd	, I don't care how easy it is for them,
na	Right.
aa	Yeah.
qw	Well, then why did he say that during his campaign?
sv	it was totally irr ...
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qo	what about voters in the other countries that you were talking about?
bh	You do not think so ?
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh .
b	Right.
bh	really?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh .
b	Oh .
b	I see,
sv	were disqualified .
b	Yeah .
aa	Well ... Right,
sd	And at one point they took another vote on it,
sv	Well, with the minorities and we are saying we have lower voter turnout.
sd	Well, I haven't either,
sd	I mean, I have a friend who, if she likes something, isn't sure what size somebody might need, will buy it in every color and size and, you know, take everything back again .
sd	you know, it's a game to her,
sd	and I also, you know, usually have checked over things, you know, if it's like an appliance or something to make sure, it has the features in it that I want.
sd	Now we've had one lately, a Dustbuster Plus that we bought,
sd	and we've had it for a while,
sv	but, I think a lot of goods are made not to last real long
b	Yeah.
aa	Well, that's true,
b	Uh huh.
b	Well, yeah,
sv	you, I think there can be a lemon in anything but, I think more often than not,
sv	you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time,
sd	I mean, we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law which is extremely difficult to do.
sd	We never could get it declared a lemon,
sd	you know, and, we went round and round with the manufacturer and everything,
ny	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa^m	I think technology is better,
sv	I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better you know,
sv	everything is so automated,
sv	and I think that certainly makes a difference back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and, you know, had some pride in it.
aa	Well, yeah,
b	Yeah,
sd	I understand that it's being proposed as a requirement, for, young people to go into public service.
b	Yeah,
sv	I think maybe a year would be, the longest.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Right.
b	Right.
aa	That's right .
aa	No,
sv	But, you know, if, a lot of people flat can't afford to.
b	You know,
sv	and most kids these days have gotten themselves into, financial situations, where they have to be working all the time.
sv	So, it's a really tough question.
b	Yeah,
sv	and, if you put them in public service right out of high school, then that postpones their college, for a year
sv	and that would upset a lot of people too, because they just want to get on,
b	Yeah.
sv	but I think it can't be something that's mandatory.
sv	it has to be something that's voluntary. You know, which is pretty much the way it is now.
aa	Yeah,
sv	and you've a choice of where you want to go.
sv	and handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it.
aa	Yeah,
sv	But, they would have to be supported in some way,
b	Right.
aa	Right,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	much, it would take up more time than anything
sv	They wouldn't have to spend money advertising and things like that.
sv	You go to school
sv	and you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something,
sv	and, I think, that they could get some results from that, because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded,
sv	but they don't know where to go to, to do anything.
aa	Yeah,
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I don't either .
aa	Yeah,
fc	Sure,
fc	you too.
fc	Bye.
qo	So what do you guys having up there?
ar	Well, no,
sd	We did an air show out at, Boone Greene, no out at, Andrews,
ny	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bh	Really?
sd	But, we have all these,
sd	and we had all this rain,
sd	and you know, the average, first frost is like the fifteenth of November here
sd	but usually it's not until later .
b	Yeah.
qy	is it, is it flooding anywhere?
sd	we're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here, which will be, you know, a little bit more typical, autumn weather. But really it's strange.
sv(^q)	you know, the poor trees, said what ,
b	Yeah,
sd	and, I was up there last weekend,
qy^g	So you all actually had some color,
qy^d	It kind of crept in
b	Yeah,
ba	Gorgeous.
ba	Beautiful.
b	Yeah.
sv	like the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy.
sv	Well, I think they're having a lot of trouble right now.
sd	Well, I had one that was needed to be able to be moved along at a pace a little faster than he was going to be able to be moved in public school,
sd	he's loved it.
ny	Yeah,
sd	overall on campus about twelve hundred, but in the upper four grades, about four hundred and something
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sd	and he was just ahead at an early age
sd	and even in the fourth grade where they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program.
sv	You're just getting started.
aa	Yeah,
sv	We wouldn't have thought of crossing a teacher when we were in school.
sv	Wouldn't have thought of it
aa	Yeah,
sv	and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands.
sv	Well, the world changes,
sv	I mean they're exposed to a whole lot more things.
sv	And I just don't think that this doesn't always get emphasized anymore,
aa	Yeah,
sd	And when it was skirts, it was like, get down on the floor
sd	and it's no more than so many inches above the knee .
sd	Because it was mini skirt time back there at one time.
aa	Yeah,
nn	No,
qy	FIVE?
qy	only five?
ar	Well, no,
sd	I just saw the latest one.
sd	It was fantastic.
b	Yeah,
nn	No,
ny	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I think it's a hundred years.
ny	Uh huh.
nn	No,
na	excellent, excellent special effects.
qh	Well, you know why?
sd	William Shatner wrote it.
sd	And even worse, he directed it.
aa	yeah,
aa	Yeah,
na	I think so .
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
nn	No .
qy^d	Not in a crowd like that.
sd	It was like, want an autograph, want to stand in line for about four hours.
sd	It was a pretty crowded place.
b	yeah,
sd	And nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship .
ny	Uh huh
aa	Uh huh,
sd	saw THE ADDAMS FAMILY last week.
sd	It was pretty good.
ny	yeah,
ny	yes,
sd	And he runs around a lot.
sd	you know, just finger hopping.
nn	No,
ng	Not really.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well I certainly hope so.
na	Almost a hundred percent.
sv	don't need a closet .
b^m	cathedral ceilings.
sd	Well I hadn't thought about it in that sense, of the high roofs.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sv	If it's the kind of river I'm thinking of, better than, than us, you know .
ba	Well that's nice.
sd	So you're just as likely to wake up and discover you're in two inches of water.
no	it's a third of an acre.
aa	That's true.
sv	and while there are some advantages to that, there's less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things.
aa	Entirely.
aa	from that aspect, you're right.
aa	No,
sd	so moving up thirty five, I stopped when I got to Denton.
qy	you all both work downtown?
sv	well, this is a wonderful thing that you're doing here still helping them out.
bk	Oh.
ng	I do tole painting.
ny	Uh huh,
ny	Uh huh.
bk	Oh.
aa	It does,
ng	mostly I have just given them away as gifts.
sd	I've done, perpetual calendars and cookie jar lids and, on and on, you know, just things like that,
sd	I just work at Stop and Shop out there in Ogden
nn	No,
sd	So, I have five children of my own,
aa	they keep me busy
ny	Yes,
sd	I brush it on,
b	Yeah.
b	uh huh.
bh	Do you?
qy^g	well that 'ud probably give you a smoother finish, wouldn't it?
bk	Oh.
qo	Now what type of woodworking do you do?
bh	 do you?
b	Oh.
qy^g	but it's hard to finish it,
ba	well, that is interesting.
ny	Uh huh.
bf	Boy, it sounds like you're really into it.
b	Yeah,
b	Oh.
aa	Yeah,
qy	Well, have you sold any of your furniture
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bf	so yours is mostly just a hobby, too, then.
b	Oh.
ba	Well, that is interesting.
ny	Uh huh,
ny	Yeah .
fc	Yeah.
fc	so I think you'll enjoy doing it.
fc	It's fun.
fc	you know, there's a shop in Roy that I really love.
fc	Uh huh.
fc	I don't right off.
fc	Ben Franklin,
aa	Okay.
sd	So we don't have a big yard.
sd	and it's, I guess what they call a story and a half.
sd	So, it's got real high ceilings on half the house
aa	It's, pretty nice.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Exactly what happened to them.
ba	that's nice.
bh	really.
qy	Are you doing it yourself?
ba	Wow.
ba	that's nice.
b	I see.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's great.
bh	is that so?
ba	Well that sounds kind of dumb.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right .
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	Wow.
b	Oh.
ba	God.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	Wow.
sd	She loves lots of windows.
bk	I see.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	But, you know, I see these magazines where, you know, dig your own deck.
sd	I kind of wish I had them, those size property and, one with a grade on it so I can build a real nice deck.
sv	I don't see any problem with testing for random drugs.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
nd	well I'm a graduate student right now at Carnegie Mellon.
sd	And I just came from Saint Paul. interviewing with Three M.
sd	And, they have a policy for, testing.
sv	And I guess the only drawback I can see to drug testing is in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some, sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
b	Right.
sd	electrical engineering.
ba	wow .
qy	They test you, before you start or before you even interview
b	Uh huh.
bk	Oh.
b	Oh .
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
nn	no.
sd^e	I'm just about to finish my Master's in May and, just interviewing with companies right now.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
qy	do they test you right now, at work too?
bk	Okay.
bk	Oh .
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
ng	never .
aa	Yeah.
^h	Well, I tell you,
qw	And actually, that one, the, the taxes on gasoline don't bug me as much as, what are we, eight and a quarter percent sales tax?
sv	And every time you go to buy anything now,
sv	I got you, because people that, don't make very much money wind up spending it all.
b	Yeah,
qo	what do you think of that new luxury car tax, anything over ten or thirty thousand dollars?
aa	sure.
nn	No,
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
aa	Sure.
qo	Well, what about the taxes on cigarettes?
b	Right.
aa	Right,
sd	But, somebody was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what we're paying, it's not that we mind paying taxes, it's that we're paying too much for a lousy government.
sd	And I, I tend to agree with that .
sd	I'm not really into what they're doing per se,
sv	and I think there's just too many levels of bureaucracy.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	Right,
sv	I mean, right now we're getting taxed probably around thirty five percent, or more.
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sv	So. I mean, they're hitting us up,
b	Right.
b	Right,
nd	Well, I do it all .
ny	yes.
b	Yeah.
sd	It's a long skinny one
b	I see.
aa	Right.
sv	And especially when the weather's not too hot or, not raining or whatever,
sd	but, sometimes I, I said, I sometimes I wish I had more space you know.
sd	I grow a lot of things, a lot of food.
sd	And sometimes I want to plant something, there's not enough room to plant. Some of those things like, you know, the things that vine like, cucumbers, or, squash or something, like that. Plant one of those
sv	and it takes up your whole space .
b	Yeah.
aa	Right.
^2	The basics.
b	Right.
sd	I got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago.
sd	The first one, they started them indoors this time.
b	Yeah.
sv	But, sure is a heck of a lot of work.
sv	Because you got to, watch them every day, and keep them watered
sd	and I don't think I'll do it again .
b	yeah.
sd	and the kids want to swing,
sd	and I push them on swing.
sd	And I mow my own lawn.
sd	And I don't have a sprinkler system.
b	Oh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	and she moves it around ever other day.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	But, they want too much money.
b	Yeah.
aa	Right.
b	Right
sv	and all of a sudden you've got to do something else.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, if you, enjoy it too, you know, you can get out in the morning before it gets hot and, and do it and stuff, when you only have to,
b	Right.
sv	When the days start getting a little longer, you know, I can start doing it in the evening after work.
sd	when they rollback an hour.
no	I don't know.
sd	I really don't know.
sv	And, I think it's coming up here soon.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	One year I didn't put anything on
sd	Next year I was planting some broccoli and some of those, they're called cabbage, cabbage loppers, or whatever.
sd	They were just covered with them,
sd	I didn't go out there for about three days, you know, and I went out there one day and the plant was nothing left but a stem,
sd	they devoured it that quickly.
sv	And, they, have you, a good appetite .
sd	I picked off like twenty of them
aa	yeah.
sd	And I've been watching them every day
b	Right.
sv	Well, the good stuff.
aa	Right.
sd	And, I had sandy loam hauled in.
sd	On my driveway, I guess, that's what they do
sv	But, you know, you can improve your own soil there
sv	but the Texas soil isn't the greatest, gardening soil.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Small enough,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	And it weighs twenty pounds or, something like that.
sd	My neighbor across the street has one.
sd	I see him out there,
sd	and I guess it has a thatcher attachment to it.
aa	Yeah.
sd	I have a friend who has one
sd	and it's a fairly large one to, heave it up into the back of the van, bring it home and, check it back and just grab it, you know, if I, just go to my garage and grab it.
ba	That would be nice.
b	Uh huh.
qw	What have you got growing right now?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Okay,
qo	what kind of onions do you grow?
sv	they are the best.
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
b	Yeah.
sv	and, we really missed them when they were gone, because the ones from the grocery store just can't, compare.
sd	She made these onion rings that were so good,
sv	and, and, you don't realize how many dishes you put onions in, that it's an ingredient,
sd	and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better.
b	Right.
sd	And some we do green
aa	yeah.
sd	you're making me hungry here.
b	Oh.
b	Yellow peppers,
b	Yeah.
^h	Just let me see what I got,
sd	and I planted potatoes too.
b	the potato,
sv	they do.
sd	Some beet, potatoes
sd	and I've got some tomatoes still growing, in containers,
sd	I got to wait for a place to, to free up.
sd	our kids love pickles
sd	We've got some good, Hybrid Burpee pickler cucumbers
sd	and we're going to try to see if we can pickle our own
aa	I know it.
aa	I guess.
sd	An experiment.
sd	I'd like to you know, just try something new, every year that, I haven't tried before
bh	Do you.
qw	How old is she?
qy^d	I guess you have not reached the stage where you need to, promote a college or anything,
sd	I've got one that's seven and one that's three,
qy	So, is there, are you planning to, like, encourage your children to go to a particular school?
qy^d	That you are going to let them make.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	So did you commute everyday then
bk	okay.
bk	okay,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b^m	Yeah.
sv	And, you know, I guess, you know, when you have to do it that way, it makes your choices a lot easier
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
aa	Exactly.
qw	where is that at?
bk	I see.
qy	Did you work somewhere else,
bk	I see.
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see.
b	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I didn't know that.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	really.
aa	Yeah
sv	Well you know I think Richardson is probably you know one of the places that would definitely
ba	Well, that sounds great, Ellen.
bk	okay.
b	okay,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	Southern California's still pretty large.
b	I see.
sd	years ago there was a big dispute on my dad's side
sd	but, anyway, my mother's side we had our first real reunion that I've ever gone to last summer
qy	Well, have have you, do you have an interest in genealogy?
qy^d	Not a passion,
sd	My grandmother's, sister who would be somewhere in West Virginia.
sv	I'm quite a bit, I'm probably a lot older than you are.
no	I don't know.
na	actually I've, I've been in them but, just visiting
sd	And she's lived with us for like five years.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qy	To put her in a rest home?
nd	well, see it's more my grandma that feels that way.
sd	She says that when her husband died that my uncle had said that he would never put her in a rest home.
sd	and my mom has to take care of her pretty much
qw	When he retired?
b	Yeah,
sd	So that, that works out good.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	You think?
sv	They're seen as senile .
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm twenty.
ny	Yeah,
aa	All right.
sd	so, I've been very guilty about not making the effort to take things where they belong.
sd	Well, we've been here since January,
sv	so, I guess we're old timers compared to some people.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Well, where do you do that,
sd	but I didn't know where to take them.
bk	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
sv	Well, yeah they, they're a lot of bulk, anyway
b^r	yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b^m	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
aa	Right,
^2	Thinking about it, anyway .
b	Yeah,
qy^g	You can't chat all day, .
fc	Okay.
fc	Okay.
fc	Bye bye.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
^h	Well, I'm a drafter,
sd	And that's pretty much the norm for me.
sd(^q)	They ask me, you know, what are you doing in a dress
^q	Ran out of jeans .
nn	No.
nn^m	No,
nn	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I have to go to a business meeting once a month with him,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	middle of the road.
aa	Uh huh,
sd	And you know they have the no shorts deal,
sv	But, You know, I guess that's one of the things you got to put up with when you don't have a dress code.
sv	Supposedly and backless things
sd	but, I've seen those, too,
b	yeah.
na^m	Lisa.
qy	Are you the Expressway sites?
bk	okay.
ft^m	Thank you.
fc	Uh huh,
sd	I just read for escape.
b	Yes.
sd	Well, just, I just finished one last night. A great book.
sd	Strange book. Beautifully written.
sd^r	Just beautifully written.
ny	Yeah,
sd	So, he considered himself to be, you know, a true Vietnam soldier.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I have never been able to make it through any of Michener's work.
qy	are you a Civil War buff at all?
sd	Because I finished one,
sd	and the novel didn't do that much for me.
sd	So, I then read, was it BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM,
sd	I think it was BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM.
sd	It's kind of like a historical compendium, of the Civil War,
sd	and it's not a story of the Civil War,
sd	And it's fascinating because I had always, you know, been raised on this, you know, Proclamation with the Civil War.
na^m	There was a lot more to it than that.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qh	Well, you know what else really surprised me, now
b	yeah,
sd	My husband is always, you know, talked about Texas being a, rebel state.
sd	And, my God, all this Civil War pride.
sv	They might as well have not even been there.
sv	You know, they weren't a state
aa	I'll bet they did.
qh	Well, you know, why they actually held them off?
ad	Now, you didn't hear me say that.
b	Yeah.
ba	Boy,
sv	I mean, my god, they fought and won the whole thing.
b	Oh.
ba	That's a beautiful state.
sv	and besides, you know, if corn didn't grow there, it didn't matter.
sd	Iowa and Nebraska.
b	Yep.
qh	or, God knows what.
sv	Well then, she's going to come out well rounded.
sd	But outside of those kind of things, you know, the other thing that I've really gotten into reading,
sd	Well, I've gone to the point where my husband travels, I get out like, you know, two or three books.
sd	And I'm trying to think of, Isaac Asimov, ROBOT series.
sd	I mean, I think I've read all four of them
sd	In the last six weeks he's been on the road a lot.
sd	You know, I think I read HAWAII, when I was about ten years old
sv	Which is about the developmental level that, you know, you need to be at to read those things,
sd	And I got about like a hundred pages through it and realized I had like a thousand more,
b	Yeah.
aa	No.
qy	Is that a big, thick book?
qw	what the hell for?
bk	okay.
h	I don't know.
sd	I don't know if I'd call it science fiction or fantasy.
sd	Well, I loved that novel.
sd	And I read the whole damn book while I was home hauling out, you know, like ten gallon buckets of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and, reading about these guys wearing their little free man still suits
sd	and, I think that's probably my favorite of any piece of science fiction that I've ever read.
na	And the movie was awful.
ny	yes,
no	I don't know,
ny	Yeah,
sd	I was real disappointed in that.
aa	That's true.
bk	Oh.
sd	Well, see I am debating whether or not I want to go see the movie after having read the book.
sd	I mean the book is chilling.
sd	Just chilling.
sd	Then I won't tell you.
sd	It's just that if you're ever really want to just be scared out of your wits,
na^m	That's the one.
ny	Yes,
nn	No,
b^m	yeah,
sv	Well, of course, you know, it's one of the last few things in the world you'd ever want to do, you know. Unless it's just, you know, really, you know, and, you know, for their own good.
sd	I'd be very very careful you know, checking them out.
sd	And, I was fortunate in that
sd	So, I was very comfortable, you know, in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it.
sd	We were not really happy with, nursing home that we finally had.
sd	Fortunately, she only had to stay a few weeks
qh	You know, is there something else we could have done, you know, in checking out all the places that, might be available.
b	Oh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh
b	Right.
ba	I can imagine.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's great.
aa	That's right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And, it's usually not a very smooth, smooth thing.
sd	I was lucky too that I only have one brother.
sd	And, fortunately, we agreed, you know, on exactly, you know, what we thought should be done.
sd	We were lucky in one respect in that after she had her stroke she wasn't you know, really much aware of what was going on.
sd	That nursing home life would not have been, you know, anything of her choosing,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	Yes.
sv	I think that great strides are being made nowadays in caring for the elderly, you know, in a, in a whole lot of areas.
sv	Just people are, of course, populations getting older.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yes,
b	Yes.
b	Yes,
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
aa	I think your right.
fc	Yeah.
fc	Take care.
fc	Bye bye.
b	Right.
sv	and if you try to get it outside of your corporation, you're going to pay an arm and a leg.
b	Right.
qy	do you also get dental?
aa	I know.
sd	Now my husband is with, Northwest Airlines
sd	And I don't know how people that don't have it can afford it.
sv	Or maybe they don't .
aa	That's right .
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I do too.
sv	I think it's just a crying shame, for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks.
sv	She isn't recovered .
b	Uh huh.
aa	sure.
sv	Well, I think they're com , they've come a long way. at least some companies. Some of them, my girlfriend, in particular, that works for a rental car agency
sv	and, as manager they have a very, very poor leave policy
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	One of the benefits we get, of course, is travel .
sd	It's wonderful .
sv	The only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere
aa	That's right.
sv	Well, it's kind of a broad subject,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Texas.
sd	Well , I work for school district
sd	Richardson.
b	Oh.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	And it's not going to get any better.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think living in Richardson, we're kind of spoiled because I think we come closer to getting our money's worth as far as the city is concerned, I think than probably any city in the country.
bh	Is that incredible?
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
na	Well, yeah, I think the teachers did,
sd	my pay doesn't change.
ny	Yes.
ny	Yes,
ba	my,
ny	Yes,
b	Yeah.
sd	Very little. Because they're grown.
sd^r	They're grown and gone.
ny	Yeah
ny	yes,
aa	Yeah,
sd	Because I came with a split family
ny	Yeah
qh	and you know what?
sd	Sometimes that's okay.
b	You know, right,
b	Yeah.
na	of the six, we've got four around here.
sd	you know, well, we're talking like north Texas.
sd	And then, one is in Montpe , Mont , Montpelier Montpelier, Vermont
sd	and the other one is in Everett, Washington.
sd	Well, that's, the, my little pair. And my second marriage.
ny	Yeah,
sd	And, Well, they wanted to go,
sd	and the, the, third daughter fell in love with, Vermont.
aa	Yeah,
nn	No.
^h	Well, let's see,
sd	I wish to God he would go back.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
ba	my,
sv	but, we are seasoned minds.
aa	Yes,
b	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sv	And we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and in the middle altogether.
aa	At seven,
aa	Yes,
aa	Yeah,
sd^t	And so forgot what the second question,
sv	Well, the trends in the families were to spread apart, do your own thing.
sd	But I have seen lately, yes, I am seeing, I'm seeing a change that, whoops, government can't do it,
sv	schools are not able to
sv	and between a person's religion, their faith in their maker you know, whether you're Christian or Jewish or whatever,
sv	those are the two that, that have the wherewithal
sv	So when another group of, people step in, try to do it, they're tromping on our territory, so to speak,
sd	I firmly believe that,
qy^d	Well, considering you moved here from California, I guess, the rain for the past few weeks has been different than what you have down there.
sv	Especially the last few years.
qy^g	it's kind of been a drought out there hasn't it,
sd	Yet .
sd	Generally if we're going to get them, it's not going to happen, prior to January one.
sd	You may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting in December,
sd	Then by March things are getting warm again,
sd	It's been eighty degrees on Christmas day here before.
sd	Lots of times.
aa	No,
sv	and it's really pretty.
sd	I'm a scoutmaster
ny	yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	But, it's definitely different.
qy^g	And then, I guess you've been through a couple of summers here, too, right?
aa	it is.
sv	and California for the most part.
qy	Were you northern California?
b	Central.
qy^g@	So that was, Dry, but pretty even climate, wasn't it? Year round, fairly, Not wide fluctuations.
sv	Hundred , when you have a hundred here, everybody's dying .
b	Oh.
qw	What types of, What type, what type of business takes you to those climates
bk	Oh.
bf	Not so much still trying to translate old texts as just trying to translate modern versions into other languages.
b	Oh.
bf	So you're with the home office now .
sv	Well, I think, all in all there are a lot worse climates than Dallas,
sv	and things do happen severely a few times a year,
b	Yeah,
sd	and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time, I like that. Particularly if I'm going to be outdoors and doing, outdoor activity, hiking and things.
ba	And that's nicer.
ny	Yeah,
sd	Think we're going in just a couple of weeks out to east Texas,
sv	the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the really severe storms that occasionally come through out here on the plains.
sv	There's not much between us and the North Pole .
sv	I think we definitely need more of it, definitely.
aa	yeah,
aa	Exactly.
aa^r	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
sv	well, but that's why they should have started doing stuff before.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
nn	No,
sd	Like, San Francisco has a real, strong AIDS support group and all that kind of stuff
sv	and, I think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level, you know, rather than just in the places you know, where it's predominated so far, because you know it's bound to spread .
aa	Right .
sv	Especially with the ultra conservatives move our political system sort of seems to be taking.
b	Yeah
^h	God,
sv	and it's really not necessary, until the, disease reaches its final stage, you know, becomes really infectious
sv	and, I think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people you know, try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that you know, they don't, they don't have to be just completely cut off from the community
h	and, I don't know,
h	I don't know.
bh	they did?
b	Uh huh.
ng	Not quite,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	that's good.
bk	Okay.
sd	and they'd just sort it out for you .
sd	It was really pretty good if you're lazy like I am,
b	okay,
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	It can,
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
aa^m	Yeah,
sv	it's like well you know, if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink, you know, like a couple of twelve packs, maybe, over the weekend it's going to be hard pressed to put all your recyclables in that one place, you know.
sv	So it's kind of a pain in the butt.
h	But, I don't know.
sv	Make it a little more convenient.
b	Yeah.
qy	you can actually rent those?
bk	Okay.
sd	up here the city provides them.
b	okay .
qw	So where exactly are you in terms of, like, Sarasota?
bk	okay.
qy	And Sarasota is on the west coast?
bk	Okay.
b	Yeah,
na	occasionally.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	that might be a lot to do with it.
bk^m	Minnesota,
sd	Problems with our educational system, a lot of it's due to money.
sd	And they're trying to spend money where we don't have it
aa	Well it is.
b	Right.
sv	Cause if you can't pay the right people, you know, they're not, not going to get the people that can do a good job.
aa	Right.
sv	And then when the kids get to school, they try to take away a lot of things that they can do to discipline the kids.
aa	Exactly.
sv	Lose their job and big lawsuit and all that.
sv	I feel that's got a lot to do with it.
b	Really.
sd	And a lot of his problems had to do with money mostly.
sv	And, unfortunately, there's not many places to get that money.
sv	Then if you don't have qualified teachers in the different ,
sv	Where maybe a physics professor,
b	Right.
aa	Exactly.
sd	And the other schools were built back in maybe the fifties or early sixties
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
bf	So you haven't really, dealt with that in a sense.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ng	mine are both out of school.
sd	And, you know, I've, in hindsight, seen some things that I wished that, you know, I had done something about that was, you know, within my power or, you know, wish that in some ways we, as parents, had more control over what's happening up there, you know, type thing.
sd	well, just over the years there were situations that, came up that I didn't think were fair or handled correctly
sv	they bring things home
b	Yeah.
sv	That's pretty interesting because just, just because you know a subject matter doesn't mean you can teach it.
aa	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yes.
ba	wow .
ba	That's encouraging.
b	Yeah.
ba	Well, you know, that's an idea.
qy^d	you're kidding.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's interesting.
ar	Nope.
sd	She gave him an F on that paper.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sv	That's interesting that the military saw that and did something about it.
sv	You would have expected them to be the last ones to .
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I can see why if you've got little ones just coming along.
b	Yeah.
bd	That's okay.
sd	another one from a different state besides Texas.
b	Right.
ny	yes
sd	and I brought a lot of family together then.
sd	It went pretty good.
sd	I used to, you know.
sd	Usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday,
sd	She has like seven sisters I think.
sd	They show up and all their kids.
sd	so it's a pretty big reunion,
sd	probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone, you know, could eat comfortably and everything,
sd	I guess probably the most helpful thing was that, for the rent, we rented like a rescue squad building or something like that.
sd	And, everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for like soft drinks
sd	And each person in the family, you know, brought a dish, or something.
na	It was kind of pot luck.
sd	You know, everybody brought their specialties, I guess you would say.
ny	Yeah.
sd	she's eighty six.
na	she looks probably like she's in her early sixties
sd	and if she didn't have arthritis, she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact .
b^m	yeah.
sv	also one thing that's helpful,
sd	but all my family lives like in the same county
ad	But it's just kind of like get on the telephone
sv	and everybody just shows up.
sv	I would say you're spread out, then.
sd	my immediate family, you know, my parents and my brothers and sisters, I guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever,
sd	But since they've moved back to Carolina's, we still are the only ones do not live in in Yantsen County.
sd	I live in Raleigh,
sd	So I mean, we're spread out,
sd	Nobody moves away except us .
ny	Yeah,
sd(^q)	Just like this town is too small for me,
fp^m	Hi .
br	Pardon me.
ny	yes,
sd	we take the kids to the park,
nn	No,
aa	Yeah,
sd	So they can have time with him
na	Right,
sd	and, we just do all kinds of fun things like that
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	So, you make more fun than, you know.
sd	they think that's a lot of fun.
sd	but during the day, you know, it's all devoted to our kids
b	Yeah,
ny	Yes,
b	Uh huh,
sd	I'm not sure which one we went into,
b	Uh huh,
aa	Yeah,
sd	That's on Plano Road,
sd	And that's a lot of fun.
sd	They have tours going through there
sd	you know, whenever we take them to Showbiz
sd	and it's a indoor fun park
sd	And parents get in free
^2	The petting farm,
b	Yeah,
sd	the kids just had a wonderful time there,
sd	You can have birthday parties there
ny	Yeah,
sd	So they had a lot of fun.
b	Yeah.
fc	Yeah,
fc^m	Well it was good talking to you.
fc	no problem.
fc^m	Bye bye.
ny	Yes.
sv	That's a rather broad topic .
b	Yeah.
sd	we live in Plano.
qw	and where you are?
b	Uh huh.
qy	do you have children in school?
b	Yeah.
sd	my oldest is his first year in high school
sd	they're coming down on the principal,
sd	Well , I don't either,
sd	And, I mean, it just scared me to death
aa	Maybe so.
b	Yeah.
ba	no.
sd	I just can't imagine that.
b	Right.
aa	Right,
aa	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, maybe this thing , with the child at school, maybe that will make people think a bit more and, you know, take some steps to correct it.
no	I don't know.
sd	it was a student age person,
sv	The public school systems, well everybody's has known they've needed renovation for years, but never really had a clear direction on which way to go with it.
sv	The first direction that or I wish, I would love to see them go with.
sv	You've got some kids that'll pick up on it in the first three minutes you're talking about it,
sv	The educators need to be a little bit more open minded as well as innovative in dealing with, the various students to get the maximum potential out of the person.
b^m	Out of each child.
sv	Some kids are going to be great with mechanical stuff.
sv	Instead of pushing the scales too far either direction, I mean it's great to be well rounded and be exposed to all this stuff.
qh	But why not hit the points the kid's really interested in?
sv	They need exposure to every subject.
sv	Everything I learned about ancient Rome has not helped me anywhere in, my adult life.
qw	what type of history class is it that you're having to take?
sv	Well, the early ones they could actually combine two, levels of it, the one from seventeen hundred til say, the end of the Civil War.
sv	Combine that into one. And then from eighteen sixty five to present,
sv	but even then they're skimming over,
sv	You know, I mean, if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter, I mean, they make all these people out to be,
qh	if the isolation concept really works that good, why are our prisons overcrowded?
sd	the as a part of the revamping of the entire education system on that lev , the public school system I want to see changed too.
sv	Well, then the extreme came in,
sv	so we now isolate them.
b	Okay,
sv	Let's put him into a situation where, okay, you crossed the line, you broke the rule, you're going to have to pay for it.
sv	But, it's going to tax you physically.
sv	I mean, in , instead have them pick up around the school yard, have them weed a flower bed somewhere on the school yar . Do something to beautify the school property.
sv	the kid's having to give up his, quote, play time to pay his debt for what he did wrong.
sv	I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself.
na	I, m , most wholeheartedly agree.
sv	I mean, there's a point of over kill,
sv	Need that shock effect, where they equate the shock of being spanked with the actions they did to get spanked.
sd	we spend a lot of time outdoors jogging, bicycling, going to the park, some time watching V C R movies generally cheap things .
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
no	Most of our vacations are to go and see Grandma and Grandpa.
sd	We get an occasional one or two day thing
sd	but most of them are going and seeing Grandma and Grandpa.
sd	In Arizona.
ny	Yes.
nd	we don't go very often for holidays.
sd	They range from twenty four to five.
na	That's right.
sd	I think the hardest thing for us is to find you know, leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together with the age span that we have, you know,
sd	like the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing
sd	but the young kids don't understand it
sd	and so they get real frustrated when we try to do that,
b	Yeah.
sv	I think it's improving, actually.
sd	We had an interesting experience the other day.
sd	and we just kind of keep them at home
sd	and our next door neighbor,
sd(^q)	and she said, no, Sunday's our family day
^q	and we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them.
sv	And I think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now.
sv	I think it's gone to one extreme where the families were just running all different direction
sv	and I think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think a lot of people are panicked, how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing they've got to start doing something.
sv	Utah's a lot better than Texas.
ng	Very few.
na	definitely.
^2	Average.
sd	Never been back, since then,
sd	so we get up occasionally.
qw	where in Dallas?
no	I don't have any idea.
sv	Must be a little town.
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you want to go first?
ad	Well, you go ahead.
b	Oh,
b	yeah.
ba	it sounds fantastic.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Is it cayenne pepper, you mean?
ny	Yes.
b^m	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
qw	And how much shrimp would you use?
b^m	Two pounds,
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Okay.
b	yeah.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^m	Uh huh.
b	Okay,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	And are you cooking the whole head at one time?
bk	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
sv	And it's not much work.
aa	Yeah,
qy^d	I bet it tastes good too.
b	yeah.
qw	Now, how many could you serve?
bk	Yeah.
ba	that's good.
sv	So it's hard,
sd	And, they're big on finger food here, too. You know, chicken wings and, ribs, and that kind of stuff. barbecue and, cooking out in the yard, you know, when it's nice. Barbecue outside, chicken and that kind of stuff.
nn	no,
ba	of course.
b	Yeah.
bh	Really?
b^m	It's similar.
bh	it does?
bk^m	it looks more like a crab.
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh .
qw	and where did you say you were from?
b^m	Louisiana.
sd	I love, blackened, you know, the fish and the chicken and that kind of stuff.
sd	We have a few places up here that do that.
sd	And if ever I see it on the menu, I always get it.
sv	It is so good .
qw	Now how do they do the blackened?
qy	But, do you have to have a certain skillet, or something?
bh	No?
ng	I did have.
qy	does it have to get extremely hot?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	 I see.
b	I see.
b	Oh.
bh	really?
bk	Oh.
qy	Is that what you're saying?
b^m	uh huh.
sv	And, that is so good. Delicious.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
aa	It is.
sd	I, in fact I was in Texas for a little while.
sd	And I liked, the barbecues and the Mexican food.
sd	I have a passion for all that type of different tastes.
sd	That's why I enjoy going to restaurants and you know, trying different things.
no	I would love to.
bh	Really?
b	Uh huh.
bh	Is that right?
b	Uh huh.
qy	Now, where do you go when you go there? right on Basin Street and those places?
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	I see.
ba	that's nice.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
sd	I'm trying to think what they call their soup.
ny	Yeah,
b^m	Gumbo,
b	right.
qy	is, is that with seafood?
bh	you can?
ba	That looks good too.
sv	And it looks delicious.
sd	See we do, a thing, we call it a sea bake.
aa	I think I agree with that.
sd	so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion
aa	Exactly.
sd	Commercial, solicitations primarily.
b	Yeah.
sv	And I think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control
sd	and, that then ends up being the most common example for me.
sd	I guess I'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this one that you raised.
sd	And I don't think I would have thought about that.
sv	to surmise. It is there.
sv	Well, I guess, although, well, that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is, because, if that's the case of a tree falling in the forest
sv	and I'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because I have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded.
sv	 if your defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something you don't know about it, well, then I guess one could assume one was invaded
sd	but I don't feel invaded by it.
sd	I don't, have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things,
sd	I'm not sure why.
sd	the other side of that might be if someone found out something or surmised something that weren't true then I would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense.
aa	right,
qy	did you hear about this Lotus data base that was being put together?
sd	That would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because I would find that there be, a good possibly that their facts were fantasy.
sd	And then I would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information that I would rather they didn't
sv	But then if it turns out to generate incorrect things, that's even worse
aa	Right.
aa	Right.
aa	Right.
b	Right.
aa	Uh huh.
sv	so, maybe that is a little bit of what privacy is.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's interesting.
sd	but no concept for wanting to be private.
b	Okay.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
aa	that is true.
b	Yes.
b	Yes.
ba	That's interesting.
bk	Okay.
sd	and, I thank God every day that I have the resources that we have tapped into.
na	He's in elementary school.
sd	And he's not severely learning disabled.
sd	I mean, you know, he just, He's being helped.
sd	he was in resource from second grade till fourth grade in math,
sd	and they recently released him from, resource, which I was thrilled,
sd	I really was.
sd	It is something new,
sd	It's wonderful.
ny	Yes,
sd	it's interesting, because I'm convinced I have the same learning disability, or had, that was ignored.
aa	That's right.
sd	Well, you know, it's funny.
sd(^q)	and I would say to the teacher, you know, it's amazing.
sd(^q)	And I kept saying to the teacher, something is wrong here.
sd(^q)	And the teacher kept saying, he has a May birthday.
sd	these teachers as far as I'm concerned are absolute saints, because in second grade, it was about the second week of school, I went up there,
sd	Well, I was,
aa	it was
ny	yep,
sd^r	she had already picked it up.
sd	And sure enough, they tested him
sv	and to me that's the same thing.
aa	That's true.
aa^r	That's true.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
aa	Exactly,
aa	that's right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Really,
b	Yeah.
sv	and that was one of the points that I made, is that you're not comparing apples to apples.
sv(^q)	You know, you can't say, you know, I know Steven probably would not be accepted because he has a learning disability into a private school. which is too bad.
sv	But on the other hand, I can't necessarily blame them, you know, they are a private school
sv	and they, can do whatever they want.
aa	that's right,
sv	Perhaps they are, because they're,
aa	You're right.
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	Yeah.
b	Right,
sd	I was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they said that, you know, these children, they had to be the best,
qh	Well, is that good?
b	Sure,
sd	And so that's why I said, their childhood is extremely different from mine.
sd	We certainly didn't carpool and run the way I do.
aa	No.
b	Uh huh.
bh	 really?
sd	I spent three years,
ny	Uh huh.
sd	I taught in Utah,
b	Uh huh.
sv	You sound pretty young for a university professor .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ad	Well you can tell me a little bit more about it because I don't think we did that in Utah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
b	yeah.
^h	Well, I haven't taught in Iowa,
ny	Yeah
sd	but a lot of schools had a lot of transient, families and a lot of families who were on the poorer side
aa	Yeah,
sd	As well as hot lunch
sv	Well, it looks like it's just about as volatile as it usually is.
qo	What do you think, Mark?
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	you know, we kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet overall tend to support them.
sd	But, I think one of the most interesting things to me recently was, you know, during the war, in, Kuwait was, the fact that they did not retaliate, for the, scud missiles that were, launched there.
sv	That just seemed to me to be a phenomenal, demonstration of restraint,
b	I see.
qy	you don't think they got the codes from the U S already?
bk	I see.
aa	That's true.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	No.
aa	No,
sv	Even at this point.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
sd	We were there for ten days.
b^m	Yeah,
b	Morocco.
ba	No kidding.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Was it hot?
bh	Really?
b	Uh huh.
sd	but I was very young
sd	So I don't remember
sd	and that was when I was a baby
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Really.
sd	but they were so destitute
sd	you know, it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	really.
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Well you lived in France,
qy^d	so you've been all through Europe.
b	No.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
qy^g	Lots of wildlife
b	Uh huh.
qw	Now when was that, when were you there?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	diving.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Is it really?
b^m	Yeah,
bh	No?
sd	I remember food .
b	Uh huh.
b	Really.
bh	Really?
ba	wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	You're kidding!
b	Uh huh.
qy	All for a thousand dollars?
ba	Wow!
qy^g	I guess I relate it to Japan where things are very expensive, aren't they?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
bh	really.
b	Uh huh.
sd	there was a crime here in McKinney, a rather heinous murder.
sd	There was no remorse shown by, at least one of the perpetrators.
sd	And yet, for whatever reason, his crime was not considered a capital crime.
sv	and quite honestly I feel very strongly that the, man has no redeeming social values
sd	So, it really bothers me that there's not a way of getting him out of the way forever.
ba	that's right .
bh	Did you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes
fa	thank you, I'm sorry, I just got home from work
sv	that, not all of them are being convicted of it, that, the, they're not even being charged with that appropr ,
sv(^q)	but the same God that can work that miracle also established the laws that said, for certain kinds of sin, certain kinds of, breaking of the law, there would be a capital punishment.
sv	Right then it was, almost immediate.
sv	As soon as the trial was over, then it was stoning.
sv	We don't have a speedy trial,
ba	That's correct.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I tend to agree on that, very strongly.
sv	Plus all the judicial system is overloaded with, all kinds of, problems, and crimes and so forth and then all of the, civil things that clog the courts,
sv	and having sat on both, criminal and a civil, jury, some of what goes through our courts is a total waste of time.
sv	Because we're suit happy.
sv	but back to the capital situation, sounds like you and I have a lot of, of, common ground at least as far as capital punishment is concerned.
sd	I would like to see some kind of reform, or some kind of streamlining so that, if a person is, convicted, and sentenced to death, that automatic appeal which goes in could be more quickly dealt with.
sv	and go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way, because it doesn't do the criminal or the victim's family, r , any of us, the taxpayer any good to have him sitting around for months and years.
sv	him could be a her.
ba	That's sad.
ny	Yeah.
sv	However, certain very liberal minded groups who do not, subscribe to the same ethical system that you and I do, such as the, civil liberties unions and so forth, will lobby against that and hold that out as long as they have breath. Which is most unfortunate because we all lose out, when people go so far out to the extreme, on either side.
sv	Because too often, they're can be extremism that hurts from any direction, regardless of whatever you're arguing or concerned about.
b	Yeah.
ng	Well, we don't right now,
sd	but, right now we don't have anything.
qo	What about you?
sd	it seems like, we've always been at a place where we'd have to go away for the summer or something
sd	we were thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house.
sd	someplace where there, you know,
qo	and, What about you all?
ba	no.
bh	Is that right?
qy	But you like pets and things?
b	yeah .
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
sd	we like pets,
sd	we've got some children
sd	from fourteen down to seven.
qo^d^c	You sound like you've got some small ones in the background.
bh	Is that right?
ba	great.
ba	Congratulations.
qw	Where are you from?
ny	Uh huh.
bk	Okay.
sd	I've been to Charleston.
ny	Yes,
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
b	I guess so.
ba	Gosh.
qy	Hills, or what?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
b	yes.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Okay.
qw	what are you studying there at Heidelberg ?
b	yeah.
ba	Well, great.
b^m	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
bh	did you?
sv	Well, you've got some experience behind you in the work force.
b^m	Yeah.
bk	okay,
qy^d	Hope it's a good program there.
qy^d^r	Hope it's a good program there.
b	Yeah,
aa	Well, yes,
b^m	Yeah .
ba	Good.
qw	Well, I was wondering what, if you all were to get a pet, like if you were to move into an apartment
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	A hamster.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	we've, taken how much we have, you know, write down how much we have coming in each month
sd	it takes some dedication to do it,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right,
t3	You've got paper under your table.
b	Uh huh.
^2	To be out of that.
sd	We try to stay out of debt .
^h	it's long term.
sd	So, we don't have any long term, you know, in stocks, or anything like that right now,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right,
b	Yeah
nn	No,
fc^m	Nice talking to you too.
fc^m	Bye, bye.
na	constantly.
sd	It seems everything I do is computer related.
sd	And if it goes down, then we're stuck all day.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I have an, I B M P S two, model thirty.
sd	It's kind of getting too slow for me,
sd	And I use my personal computer constantly,
sd	I also use my P C to emulate a mainframe terminal for our I B M mainframe and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine.
sd	So all I have on my desk is my P C,
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah .
aa	Yeah.
sd	And there's three of us E D P auditors
sd	so I ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing
sd	I don't have one at home,
b	Yeah.
sd	we've got a couple of portable lap top P C's at the office that I end up bringing one of them home a lot, to do work.
sd	If I had a machine already installed at home I would probably work just about every night .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	And it's not fast enough for a new four eighty six chip,
sd	But I'm determined to brake mine
sd	Well, that's what I do.
sd	And we had about ten people sharing this printer
sd(^q)	So the first thing when I started working at this bank, is, I said, well, now first of all we need to all be able to share this P C without getting up.
sd	but we can share the printer
sd	And we can send mail messages to each other, which is good enough,
sd	it's what we need.
sd	And then I talked them into buying a H P Laser Jet.
sd	And that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it.
aa	Yeah.
sd	and I can use either the Pro Printer
sd	So if I just need something real quick, I don't feel like getting up and going and getting what I printed,
b	Yeah.
sv	They have gotten really cheap.
sd	but the quality is almost laser quality.
sd	And I think it's called the desk jet
bh	really.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	You use the sneak , system.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	Until they got off the machine.
sd	I was amazed when I came to work,
sd	well, it's part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in Texas.
sd	Any way, I work in a big prestigious place.
sd	And I couldn't believe when I walked in the door on my first day and here's the audit department of this huge holding company, sharing a H P Rugged Writer .
aa	Yeah,
sd	It's just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the senior vice president, over audits, is cheap.
sd	And it's real hard to pry money out of him to do these things,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b^m	Okay,
ng	Linda.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I don't read as much as I would like to either.
qo	What do you like to read?
sd	That what I've been reading lately a lot of.
sd	I read all kinds of things for, helping people survive a divorce.
sd	THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED was probably one of my favorites.
bh	You haven't?
b	Okay,
ng	I'm kind of getting that one past me, but a good self help book.
b	Yeah.
ba	that sounds good.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Oh.
sv	I would imagine helping them feel good about themselves
qy^d	that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that.
ba	I'm sure,
^2	just joy reading.
sd	And I just realized I had never read it growing up.
sd	And it was good.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I know.
sd	Just like, I want to read that and I write it down.
sd	So do I.
sd	he also wrote PEOPLE OF THE LIE.
b	Yeah.
sd	Someone just recently said something really neat about that.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I can't think of his name.
br	Pardon me
nn	no,
qy	Have you been involved on the Switchboard long?
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Never,
sv	Even if you took speed reading.
^h	So, well, I'm trying to think of what other kind.
qy	Do you like Ken ?
sd	He writes, spy novels, THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE
sd	and, I've really, I really have found his books enjoyable .
ba	that sounds interesting.
sv	You know, it's so easy to get caught up on reading just for your work, or, you know, self improvement,
b	Yeah,
aa	I think so, too.
fc	And, I'll have to check out that book you, told me about.
fc	Okay,
fc	Thank you.
fc	You take care.
fc	Bye bye.
b	Okay,
bk	Uh huh.
bk	Uh huh.
bk	Uh huh.
sd	the only exercise program I'm doing right now is walking.
sd	I've got a nine month old,
sd	I have enjoyed aerobics in the past,
sd	and that's my favorite way to exercise.
b	Oh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	My husband and I use to walk together,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And then you can do it whenever you want I guess.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I guess it depends on the person, depends on how motivated you are.
sd	Because my husband used to work out three days a week at the Texas Instruments gym.
sd	And then I would just go on Saturdays.
sd	So, I guess, like I say, we've been paying these fees and not going,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sd	And I have two friends, that we walk.
sd	So when we go, we do about fifteen miles a week,
sd	but but I enjoy doing it more when I've got other people with me.
sd	You know, I usually do it because I want to, because I know it's good for me, not because, I don't feel obligated to do it.
na	I exercised pretty well up until I was pregnant,
sd	And I had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of painful.
sv	So, it would seem to be real beneficial.
nd	Well I think it made parts of it a lot easier.
bk	okay,
sd	having both of them natural, the first one was natural and going natural the second,
qy	So, do you work with T I?
bk	okay,
sd	I think, that's what the class that meets on Saturday mornings.
aa	That's right.
fc	Okay,
fc	Okay,
fc	Bye bye.
sd	Well, I don't have any strong convictions about it,
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I have nothing to say about this.
b	Uh huh.
bk	okay.
b	okay.
qy^g	And, you were just up there then,
bk	okay.
ba	Well, that's good.
sv	Well, I mean, this is like major long term commitment, like a year or six months,
sv	so you're looking at the Peace Corps or sabbatical maybe,
b	Uh huh.
sd	But that time is minuscule compared to what, they were referring to.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
sv	I think that maybe that's why some people do it is, to see the other cultures you know and some of that.
h	But, to do that, I don't know,
sd	Uh huh. Well, you know, I know American Express,
sd	And they're allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
sv	people don't know what they want to do.
b	Yeah.
sd	I, I don't.
aa	Yeah, or try to make a living.
bf^t	So you had the same one,
sv	well. Well, you'll get it over with here .
qw^t	How many times have you talked?
b	Yeah.
sd^t	I've done maybe four or five.
nd^t	Well, she just sent me the information out.
qw^t	What other topics have you had?
ba	Great,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	So that's a good deal for me.
sd	That's the way I use them,
sd	I try to make sure I don't get in debt.
^h	let's see,
b	Yeah.
sd^t	so that one was all right.
qy^d	And you've probably never gardened in your life .
b	Yeah,
sd	We take several at home.
na	I presume that I do.
sd	I suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth, because I do get things from ski associations and things, during the year.
ng	not so much that, I, more likely to see those at a ski show or something,
sd	Some fashions are always in there too.
ng	Probably not.
sd	We haven't been there before.
sd	Kind of away from the crowd is why we chose that one.
sd	It's supposedly low lift lines.
sd	But I haven't skied Utah yet,
sd	I'd like to go to Sundance and Park City and some of those.
sd	I understand Deer Valley is nice, too.
qo	Well, how about you,
bk	okay.
ba	Well, that's good.
sd	I mean, I read it,
sd	but then eventually there'll be a school project or something where my son will need to refer back through forty eight back issues to find you know, France or something or whatever it is he's looking for.
sd	I used to take SMITHSONIAN too,
sd	I liked that magazine
sd	but I was, just found myself not ever getting around to reading it.
sv	You get so many coming in,
sd	SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN comes to our house, too, I forgot,
sd	but but I do read it, too.
sd	And he takes GAMES MAGAZINE GAME MAGAZINE, which has puzzles and things that he likes to solve, you know, crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that
sd	he likes to try that,
b	yeah,
sd	Mine is a senior in high school,
qy^d	You're just sort of beginning to think about first grade.
bk	okay,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^m	What advice.
aa	Yes.
aa	Yes,
qy	You think so ?
^h	let's see,
sv	if it's something different than the one they're used to, I guess,
aa	That's right.
sv	and, like I said, if they was willing to work, in the summers and also maybe then the parents could pay a third
b	okay.
o^c	Yes,
b	No.
b	No,
qw	So, who's your, favorite team?
bh	The Dallas Cowgirls,
sv	Well, they did have a fairly decent year finally this year.
sv	At least they're coming around.
sv	Well I mean, you know, I think, once Jimmy Johnson gets his system established, they'll do all right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm a Viking fan.
sv	And they haven't been doing too hot,
nn	No,
sd	I've never been over impressed with him.
qw	Well, who's the running,
b^m	Emmett Smith.
b	Yeah.
no	I'm not sure.
qw	Who else is,
sd	I can't even think of the guy's name, either, the coach of the Vikings.
sd	Jerry Burns.
sd	he was going to keep him as the coach somehow,
nd	Well, they started out really bad,
sd	So they were in a shot to make the play offs
ny	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	And the Cardinals were kind of like the Cowb ,
ad	don't made any excuses for him .
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
no	I don't know .
sd	But, well I got my thirty day notice yesterday.
sd	I'm done, where I work.
sv	So, anyway, I guess we can't talk much more about that,
sd	I've always ran out of time ever since I've done this.
sd(^q)	They always say you've talked your ten minute limit.
sv	Make sure we get our cash flow.
nd	actually, when I was younger, I was a Cardinal fan, too.
qh	Remember Jim Hart?
sd	I don't know who else I've ever.
ny	Yes,
aa	Yeah,
sv	there's no question about that,
qy^d	Again.
qw	What are they going up to, thirty bucks or something?
qy^d	So now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year.
ba	That's interesting,
sv	my own feelings about, capital punishment is I think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony.
sv	Mandatory, I mean, summary execution, on the steps, that day.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation.
sv	But, I do know that almost all people usually die before that point.
sv	They just get too old.
sd	as far as capital punishment, on it's own merits, I have the trouble with the way it's applied.
sv	Kill you. They will kill you.
sv	And if you're black and you kill a black guy, you know, it's, you know, two hundred hours of community service.
sv	Well, it's a social disease that we have called one upsmanship, you know.
sv	We're the majority,
sv	And you're the minority
sd	But the population of blacks in the military was about twenty two percent.
sv	You know, but that's another issue altogether.
sv	As far as capital punishment, I think that, ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment.
sd	that goes back to when, America was a colony of England.
sd(^q)	In England, you went to court, you were assumed guilty until proven innocent and once they found you guilty, you know, judge said, he's guilty, kill him.
sd(^q)	And he'll say, you know, hey, that guy did it, you know, not me.
sd	or he'll have somebody lie for him.
sv	but they do that,
sd	And the judicial mishap in this event would be, hey, you got the wrong guy.
sd	they convicted him of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit.
sd	He was too far away when it happened.
^q	Big lips, flat nose, yep, that was him.
b^m	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Well, there's no question it does make a difference.
sv	Because people have to vote in different areas
aa	Absolutely.
sv	and they are doing that in a number of schools. However, probably not enough of them, country wide.
sv	How to say no to it and what have you.
sv	So it's now, to the forefront
sv	and we also don't make the issues perhaps in language that people fully understand them.
b	Uh huh.
na	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	To complain about it, right?
b^m	Right.
aa	That's right.
aa	That's right.
b	Yes.
aa	Yeah.
sv	and then it's too late to try to change them around at that point.
sv	But, everything should be started on the lower levels
sv	And perhaps it's because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive to run, that only the most wealthy can do so.
sv	And they're not always the best person for the job.
sv	But they have the money to be able to do it.
aa	Sure.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
b	Right.
aa	That's right.
sv	Now some people object during primaries, having to declare a party, whether Republican or Democrat
sv	and you do that in the primary.
sv	and I don't know that, a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason.
sv	And it's going to take these young
sv	you know, it's going to take a whole generation of my feeling, before that's going to be accomplished .
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, just the opportunity to try the voting machines,
b	Right.
b	Yes.
ba	Good.
b	Yeah.
aa	Sure it is.
b	Yeah.
bk	Oh.
sd	there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here, although the only thing I guess I wind up recycling religiously is, aluminum cans.
sd	But, we've got a couple of different places,
ny	Yeah .
nd	Well, actually, you have to put them in there unsmashed.
sd	And, when you do that it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot.
aa	Sure.
b	Okay.
sd^t	Well, I heard it that time .
nn	no,
b	okay.
b	Okay,
aa	Yeah,
sd	So when we get like, a twelve pack, then that's like twelve cents back.
ny	Yeah .
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, shoot, maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed, Pepsi cans and whatever up there .
sd	I, I tell you what really works, at least down here is, if there is even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it, you know what I mean, then people tend to do it.
sv	In other words, taking care of the environment is all well and good
sv	but if it's going to cost you to take care of the environment, they're not quite as, likely to do it as if you get something back for it. You know.
sv	so, you know, if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings, anything that they can pass on to the consumer, you know, it kind of reminds me of using an A T M card, you know, to get money or doing your banking.
sv	You know, if it's free, people will use it,
b	You know.
sd	And, all that, because there was,
sd	Now they're starting to recycle that stuff.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	Well, I mean I don't think that guns should be outlawed
ny	Yeah,
sv	But, it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun, especially if you have the money to pay for it.
b	Yeah.
sd	I didn't know that.
sd	That's where I would probably be .
sd	Well, I mean, I mean I don't really know how they can really enforce the laws any better
sv	because I mean I do think that some people need them like, for protection and stuff
sd	and I can understand them wanting to have them,
bh	It has?
b	Yeah.
qy	Well, is the crime that bad there in Atlanta?
b	Yeah
sd	I don't know if Dallas is in the top three
qy	but. Do you own a gun?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's true.
b	Yeah.
sd	and, my Dad gave me a gun
sd	but I never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it
sd	so I finally ended up giving it back to him.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
sd	and I just didn't want the responsibility.
ny	Yeah,
sd	I would be scared selling guns to people.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^r	Do you have a car?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I have a Pontiac Six Thousand.
aa	Yeah.
nn	huh uh.
sd	eighty seven.
aa	more than likely.
aa	That was it, probably.
sv	and you can hardly find one, you know.
sd	and I know he will tell me the truth.
sd	I just pay for the parts
aa	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
ny	Yeah.
^2	Boring.
bh	You think so?
sd	I bought a stationary bike,
sd	And I haven't figured how to get that soft,
sd	And I love it.
sd	I just love it.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I like to be able to sweat, have my hair a mess.  feel that, okay fine, if my bathing suit slips a little bit I don't have to be conscious of it being a little bit too low.
sd	And my bathing suit's just one piece,
sv	And it's just, I don't know, it's, it's a total free relaxation.
ny	yeah.
ny	yeah.
sd	It pushes you because you're pushing against the water in itself.
sd	So it is like double strenuous.
sd	So you're doing it yourself.
nn	Huh uh.
nn	Huh uh.
sd	Well, a lot of people wear those little, terry cloth with rubber soles on the bottom. Especially around the pool.
ny	Yeah.
sv	no big deal one way or the other.
sd	But, I never think about it until after you go there for about a week, your toes, you start getting blisters anyway.
sd	I try to make it at least three times a week.
sd	For a while I was doing it every day. Just, going, five days a week.
sd	When I was working up at, The Summit, here in Plano, I'd leave there,
sd	and I'd be at the swimming pool by four o'clock. actually about four thirty because they start at five to six,
sd	Because no matter what I did or how I did it, I invariably got myself wet.
sd	But the water only comes up basically anywhere from your waist to your, chest, I'd say.
sd	So I mean, it's your choice where you want to go,
bd	That's okay.
ng	I have a, I have a bad back,
sd	It's like I can walk,
aa	it will bother me.
nd	Well, what pushed me that way though, basically was the fact that when I went in there, is wasn't for the water aerobics.
sd(^q)	And, she said, Hey, go for the swimming pool.
sd	I said, okay, because I'm not a swimmer.
sd	I like water.
sd	But I found that this worked really well.
sd	I dropped, I'd say almost twenty pounds. Just by watching what I ate.
sd	And they fix you up with a diet, which worked real good.
qw	What?
nn	no,
sd	See when this one down here opened up, I joined as a V I P.
ny	yeah.
sd	I just went and took the, because they were offering it as an opening benefit,
sd	Like I said, I like it.
sd	And I love it.
co	let me reword that,
sd	I knew I was pushing too far.
sd	But usually, when I go into the hot tub before I go swimming, or when I come out, I'm totally relaxed when I go home.
aa	It's fun.
sd	And I've enjoyed that, watching how well I can walk up and down stairs.
sv	But most of the others to me are very dull.
sd	I get bored very easily.
sd	With the stepper, you are conscious of what you are doing because you're basically watching each step as it gets harder and down.
sd	it would depend upon which one you want.
sv	Because it all depends, you know, for everyone their own what they want to do.
aa	so I can sit there and read and listen to music, like what you said,
qy	Do you have any pets?
b^m	Two cats.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	I'm a dog person.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	But not cats.
b	Uh huh.
sv	The thing I don't like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek, of the dogs, and constantly .
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
^2	Limited.
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	and what we used to do was just put, newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter
sd	Then I would do it, you know, everyday or two days so I would clean that pan very, very rarely,
sd	and so it wasn't so bad.
sd	it just never started smelling,
sd	, all of her animals that she ever had were adopted.
aa	I that true,
sd	It was her ex boyfriend and, you know, just was not mature enough to keep the dog, didn't realize how much work it was
sd	And she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals
nn	No,
na	right, ,
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's, yeah, really true.
sd	and, you know, they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that.
sd	and, I killed that one within a very short amount of time.
b	Right.
sd	My brother had fish when I was a kid
sd	and one of the fish was missing
sd	it was not gross,
sd	Trying to remember we had a dog for a while,
sd	but because of that we didn't have very many pets afterwards
aa	like you say, they're not the most exciting pet to have.
sd	Well, a friend of mine had, an eel,
^h	I forget what type of fish it was,
b	Yeah,
sd	I could see having, maybe some of the tropical fish, that are really, really pretty
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sv	I mean, I guess that's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house, and your things destroyed the mice.
^h	Let's see ,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah ,
sd	And they had misclassed the sex of back there
sd	and then she grew to be, you know,
sd	I don't know how much,
b	Yeah
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sv	Actually it was more fun than you would think. Yeah, starting from the beginning
sd	And so it's almost impossible to,
sd	I mean, people do,
aa	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
^h	Right,
sd	they have, the bags behind them
sd	but, gosh, I can't even walk by Central Park yeah when summertime,
sv	well, it's not that long ago.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
sd	That's what I've heard too.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
aa	I know it.
bh	really?
ba	Well good for you.
sd	But, I still haven't done it yet.
aa	That's true
aa	I don't think so either.
qy	Do you keep your kids, active in sports or anything
bk	okay.
bk	Okay.
aa	No.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
^h	Sleep book,
sd	We've got quite a few of DOCTOR SEUSS' books.
bh	really?
b	Well, yeah
sd	And so I've put a lot more emphasis on that, on my kids to try and,
sd	I probably spend an hour or two.
sd	My wife works at night,
sd	They're two and one.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah .
sd	Well, pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard.
sd	Well, we just bought our house, last July,
sd	So, we're in the process of, revitalizing the whole situation.
sd	I live in Dallas.
b	Okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
ny	Yeah,
b	yeah,
sd	and then it's solid rock from then on down,
ny	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
^h	we're just happy that there's trees already there so far,
sv	and it makes for a different challenge,
sd	and, I never really, messed with anything, gardening or anything like that until now,
sd(^q)	and the first thing the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in because he said, I've got a dozen different varieties
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
b	Yeah,
sd	a few different, hybrid tea type varieties.
b	Yeah.
b	Okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	we've got the direct sun in front
nn	No,
sd	we've been pretty lucky on that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's true.
sd	It's, bermuda.
b	Yeah.
b	Okay.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's it .
b	Yeah.
ba	wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
b	okay.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
aa	That really is,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, you know, we're trying to decide what to, what to put on one side of the house and things like that,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
fp	I'm great .
b	Yeah.
nn	No,
sd	but I do not have one of my own at home.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	It's probably pretty close to what I have, because I have the same kind of thing at work.
qy	Do you use it a lot at home?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I was amazed when I took our taxes to our tax person
sv	And the, software that does the taxes is just incredible.
sd	I expected to go and, you know, drop the stuff off and go back two weeks later.
sd	It was great.
ba	That's wonderful.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home.
aa	Yeah,
sd	Now I know my boss has bought the software, that his checkbook is on on a disk,
sd	and he goes in and types his checks on the screen and then hits print,
sd	and he just whips, out, you know,
sd	and he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes
aa	That's exactly why.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
sv	As he grows up he'll be even more and more too.
ba	That'll be great.
b	Uh huh.
b	Really.
b	Well, yeah,
sd	Well I'm going through right now.
sd	and so I'm up here, you know, nights and weekends you know, working on the P C up here, you know, typing stuff.
no	I don't know.
nn^m	No,
sd	I don't know what they used to do before they,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	 and you had to type all of his papers.
ba	gosh,
sv	cut your time in half at least.
b^m	At least.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
sv	But it's amazing, you know,
aa	Yeah,
^q	Well, we'll try this out and see what it looks like.
b	Yeah,
sv	but, you know, it gets a little out of hand sometimes.
qh	Are they typos?
sd	And there's like one week, she did retypes on ninety percent of what she typed you know,
sv	and you know, it's ridiculous
aa	Well, that's exactly right.
sv	So. Anyway, you know, maybe it'll help in some way,
aa	I do too,
sd	And, like, you have your own little code name, you know,
sd	So, we were each limited to like twenty minutes a day, you know,
aa	it added up big.
sv	I'm sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations, you know.
fc	You too.
fc	Bye.
sd	in the Houston area.
ba	that's great.
sd	we are too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's great.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
aa	it does.
sv	And so, you know, you could also apply the magazines toward that.
aa	Yes.
aa	I know it.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
ba	that's great.
b	Right,
sd	because, you know, I've talked to many people
aa	Yeah,
sd	But now, you know, I don't mind as long as things are getting recycled, you know, that we don't get reimbursed.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
na	I know the one that we use, has, recycling for the bags.
sd	and they're promoting the cloth bags. You know, the reusable cloth bags.
ba	that's great.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I understand,
sd	And he'll go pick them up because he just can't stand that.
sd	we have all our piles of recyclables also.
sd	I remember at Christmas the only thing that I'm,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Well, that sounds like you all really have a great system worked out there.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	but, something does need to be done about the Styrofoam that,
aa	yeah,
aa	No.
aa	Right.
sv	and I think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know like our cafeteria here uses a lot of Styrofoam
ba	Well, that's good.
sv	they should last awhile .
sv	I believe we are.
sv	And so it will be good, in the long run.
fc	Well, I enjoyed it.
sd	Normally I listen to C N N or HEADLINE NEWS about an, hour a day,
aa	That's true,
sd	On the whole, I'm pleased when I have an opportunity to hear just the facts.
sd	I think I'm fed up with trite.
sv	I, we're certainly in agreement there.
sv	Radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need to get done.
sd	I don't know which that answer is.
sd	Well, I used to watch SIXTY MINUTES until they did two programs, , that I knew both the people and the incidences,
sd	and I knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint, that was, in my estimate, nowhere near truth but was much better for ratings.
sd	And it, ever since that time I just don't watch.
qw^d	I don't know how old you are,
sv	Well, Brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold, of Cronkite
sv	and he did a pretty good job.
sv	Well, once they've reported the facts, all they can offer is an opinion anymore.
sd	Well, I almost felt like it was too much.
sd	I spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst,
sv	and I don't need their fill ins, you know .
ny	Yes,
nd	Well, I think, my background is probably what absolutely turned me off with SIXTY MINUTES.
sd	I like U S NEWS and WORLD REPORT.
sd	I believe in giving anything a chance.
sd	but I keep coming back to that one,
sd	It's primarily, a few big stories and then lots of high level reports.
^q	here's what went on in Asia over the past week,
sv	in the interest of efficiency we all have to find ways,
sd	and it's one of those that I can read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that I'm going to spend in there.
sd	And it just seems to fit nicely, so that I can get it read in about three days.
sv	Well, to broaden your horizons, make you think about different things anyway.
sv	Well, anytime that we stop and think it can't hurt.
sd	I'm with you,
nn	No.
ba	Well, it does sound very interesting,
sd	maybe our phone company out here will get around to, offering something like that.
sv	Well, it's not often you get, many women interested in football .
qy^r	Do you follow football very much?
sd	Well we can talk about something else.
b^m	No,
qy^d	Kids are out.
ny	Yeah,
ny	Yeah.
no	I follow the Cowboys
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah,
sd	but I haven't been to any games recently.
ny	Yeah.
sd	it's pretty nice.
ba	That's good.
b^m	yeah,
sd	That's about the extent of it.
b	I see.
bk^m	B Y U,
qw	Leslie, what are you studying?
b^m	Nursing.
sd	My mom's an L V N.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah,
nn	No,
sd	but, she's been working on a late shift.
sd	She works the graveyard shift.
sd	And she really enjoys it.
sd	and she's really enjoying herself.
ba	Well, good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree.
sd	Hope you'll like it.
qy	Do you plan on staying in the Dallas area?
b	uh huh .
b	Yeah,
nn	No,
sd	but I'm originally from San Antonio
sv	So if ever wanted, you know, pursue anything more than your nursing degree, that'd be the place to do it.
ba	great.
fc	Well, like I said, good luck to you.
fc	All right,
fc	Okay.
b^m	Okay,
bk	okay.
sd	Well, I'm also in Dallas.
sd	The reason that I ask is the two conversations I've had, have been out of state.
qy	But, have you always lived here in Dallas
bk	I see.
qy^d	well, you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood.
qy^d	You probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow.
bk	Yeah.
ba	Well, that's good.
sd	Around in Texas
h	But, I don't know,
sd	I live, over in the Lake Highlands area if you're familiar with that.
aa	Okay.
sd	This is pretty well where L B J and Audelia, Skillman cross.
sd	We're just north of, White Rock Lake.
sd	Well, we have some very nice homes here in this area.
aa	Yes,
qo	How about you?
bk	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
aa	Yes,
sv	Well, we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in Dallas.
sv	Not as bad as Houston,
qr	Well, now, do you live in a home, or zero lot home,
bk	Okay.
b	Oh.
qy	Well, was your house in good shape,
bh	it was?
b	I see.
aa	Yes,
sd	where I live is a house that's seventeen years old when I bought it.
sd	And I'm not sure what happened,
sd	I, I found a lot of things,
sd	Well, I collect antique tools, for one thing, well, I'm sort of in an antique business,
sd	And, I'm building a log house at a farm that I have in East Texas, which is a hundred miles from here.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
sd	you know, of course there's still a lot of work to be done,
nn	No,
aa	Yeah,
ng	Well, it's kind of, hilly,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
ny	Yeah,
aa	Yeah.
qw	Wh , at which one?
bk	okay
sd	it's just north of me here.
ba	That's great.
b	Well, yeah,
sv	Pretty good trip.

aa	No, kidding.
qy^g	That's pretty easy substituting isn't it?
b	Ooh.
ba	That's great.
sd	I love tennis too
sd	and I ski,
ba	that's great.
nn	No,
sd	I've skied in Colorado
sd	I've been to Telluride which is on the west side and, Copper,
sd	Copper is kind of my favorite up there. Breckenridge and Keystone.
sd	I guess those are the only places I've skied up there.
sd	Me, too.
ba	gee,
b	Yeah.
ba	I can imagine, my lord.
ba	super.
qo	What about Utah?
b	Yeah,
sd	Always want to go to Canada Canada to Banff or somewhere like that .
ng	not all of them .
sd	my kids are all grown.
sd	But my youngest son is a skier.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right .
na	I think there's some problems,
b	Okay.

bk	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yep.

b	Yeah.
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think that's all right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
nn	No,
b	Right.
sd	and he was always on pretty good terms with them.
sd	my sister just had a baby
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
sv	and aside for that, they're the best and brightest of China
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy^h	See, these are refujees, you mean?
bk	Okay.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yes.
bh	are you really?
qw	Where is it going to be?
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's marvelous.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Uh huh.
sd	we never get them at both of them
aa	it seems like,
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's a neat idea.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah,
sd	And I often feel funny because I'm in a branch that's all but died
sd	I just have one aunt and my family.
sd	and we're kind of off on the sidelines.
sd	So we keep going even though we're not a real big part of it.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's great.
b	Uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
bf	So there's lots to do.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
b	Oh.
sd	and it's just too much for all of them, all of that group to travel.
aa	Right.
sd	and we thought that would be fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That's a heavy burden.
b	No .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
ba	boy.
ba	what fun.
aa	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And, they do it as a labor of love.
sv	So, the officer idea is a good idea.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
fc	Uh huh.
fc	Well, thanks a lot I enjoyed talking to you.
t1	Well, what do we currently have,
sd	Eighty eight.
sv	it's not pretty old.
qy	So, you think their quality control's going down over there, kind of ?
sv	Well, I, I think we're going to see that I think, that the quality that the Japan carmakers had is slipping a little bit, while American carmakers are trying to get their, put together,
sd	I've had no problems with my Subaru,
b	Well, really,
sd	and those things just keep ticking.
sd	I mean, they can rack up a hundred fifty K on them,
sd	and they're still beating on them,
sv	and it's just amazing
sv	but they're still a lot, I think, definitely better than the American carmaker system .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, maybe you need to unload it on somebody el , .
b	Yeah,
b	well.
b	Anyway,
qw^d	I'm not sure I'm real familiar with the body style on that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
bk	okay,
qy	do you have a family?
bk	Okay,
ny	yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	The only gripe I have is performance.
sd	and then I could upgrade now if I wanted to
b	Yeah .
qy^c^r	Hello.
na	Okay.
qw^d^c	Wonder what happened.
sd	it just depends,
sd	and so, anyway but, Anyway my ultimate car though, the one that I really want is, five sixty or so, Mercedes,
sv	maybe someday .
ny	Yeah.
qy^c	Hello.
b	Okay.
sd	I hope it's not my ,
sv	It may be my phone,
sd	at the other one my brother's got a Miata
aa	Yeah,
sd	they came out with a European racing, green, Miata that's a limited edition,
sd	they're only going to make like three or four thousand.
sd	and I'm like, , but, I haven't seen one yet either
sd	so, it's very authentic
b	Yeah.
aa	Uh huh.
bk	okay,
sd	it's going to bump me out.
h	Well, I don't know,
ny	yeah,
sd	but there were, you know, people were buying them for nineteen and twenty,
sd	and, they may have gone down a little bit
ny	yeah.
aa	Yeah,
sd	st , so , they just market them.
b	But, yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	I think they're only around, twenty nine K.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	I've, haven't tried to upgrade myself right now,
sd	I just made my first job hop about eight months ago,
sv	currently, I think they are a little restrictive. particularly for, certain ethnic groups or from certain countries.
b	Uh huh.
sv	so I think, you know, the, embargo we placed on the Russian Jews, although we spent years and years, lobbying for their release and their ability to, immigrate from Russia as soon as that occurred, we simply said that, instead of the, hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country, we cut that by, two thirds.
sd	I do not quite go along with that,
aa	No.
sd	Both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I think in a way, though, I also have, an opposite point of view, which is, although I believe we should, permit, you know, constant immigration into this country primarily for economic reasons, I think we should have, some quotas,
sv	but, I think unrestricted immigration, I think, is not best,
aa	Uh huh.
b	Well, yes.
sv	So I think in some ways we are, becoming a little too egalitarian in that sense,
bk	All right.
fc	I, I have talked long enough.
fc	Thank you.
fc	Good bye.
aa	Yeah,
aa	Right,
sd	Well, course there's a tremendous number of excuse me, refrigerators and freezers, both commercial and residential, utilizing freon twelve,
sd	And that's got me very, you know, highly concerned that, that's going to be quite a while before we can, undo this.
sv	Because as I say, there's a tremen ,
sv	I mean, there, there are people that have a thriving business, that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on automobiles and trucks,
sd	so, that's why I stayed more towar , towards,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	Well, most, most of the time when you see you know, the busses with the diesel those are carbon particles, and carbon dioxide and water vapor,
sd	you know diesel fuel is burned in the diesel engine
sd	Diesel is going to be around, because it doesn't evaporate easily,
no	Probably, once every five years.
ny	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah
qy	And you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	That makes it a lot easier.
sv	because it is always that hard to get everyone together.
b	Yeah,
qo	so, to make one successful, I mean, I mean what do you all do.
qy	Do you all just start planning real far ahead of time?
qy^r	do you all start planning real far ahead of time?
bh	really .
b	Yeah.
qy^d	Eat a lot.
sd	It is a lot harder for us because like I said we are spread out
sd	and so we have to plan anywhere from six, well really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone, can start their, vacation time.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	But, you also manage to make them.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	You can't really get away.
sd	Well, now that we have been talking about it, I am kind of getting home sick now.
sd	Well, my grandfather is the only one that is still around.
sd	And see, my grandmother is the one that use to plan this stuff basically.
sd	So, unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together, it is kind of like.
sd	Originally, I, was born in Missouri.
sd	But, you know, we have relatives scattered out all over Louisiana, Mississippi, here in Texas
sd	but it is harder for everyone to get home.
nd	Well, but the majority of them are like, just like how you said in close quarters.
ny	Yeah.
qo	Well, how do you all communicate? Like to plan it and every thing.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I guess probably the last one I went to I met so many people that I had not seen in probably over ten years.
aa	Yeah.
qy	I mean do you have them every year?
ny	Yeah.
sd	and then when we do, and everyone finally does get together,
fp^m	Hi.
fp	Hi.
ad	Go right ahead.
sd	I'm single,
sd	and it's pretty typical of the other town homes in the area
sd	we have a lot of town homes here as well as single family homes,
sd	and at the time that I bought this one it was just a much better arrangement for me personally.
sd	so it was easier to have a home that didn't exactly that somebody else looks out for the maintenance.
aa	It certainly is.
ad	Well, if you ever get one, be sure the walls are good and thick because if they're not you can hear.
sd	so I bought one that's more like living in a,
aa	It is.
sd	so you don't actually hear anybody next door to you.
ny	Yes,
sd	Well, we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees people who don't want the heat of Florida but don't want the cold of the northeast
sd	so they settle sort of in between.
ny	Yes
sd	as a matter of fact this particular community that I live in is very wooded.
sd	It is nice.
sd	we definitely have a lot of trees here.
ny	Yes
aa	Yes,
b	Right.
fc	It was good to speak with you too.
fc	Thank you,
fc^m	Bye bye.
ny	Yes
sd	And I have a pair of box turtles.
b	Yeah,
b	yeah,
sd	and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room,
nn	No,
b	Oh.
ba	that's interesting.
sv	the water,
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh,
ba	The kind you have sounds very interesting, though.
b	Oh.
b^m	F R I S E.
bk	Okay.
b	Yes,
qy	Do they bark a lot?
b	Uh huh.
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	And how about the, And how about the person in, Houston?
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yes.
sd	we used to show Saint Bernards when I was a little girl.
aa	Yes,
sd	that's where I live,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah,
aa	I, I, agree, you know,
aa	Yeah,
sv	They ought to get it for killing a civilian just as easily as a policeman.
aa	Yeah.
sd(^q)	And one of the questions the other day, this last paper, and I haven't seen the results of it, I'm anxious to, was do you think that, capital punishment ought to apply to drug dealers. Which I thought was a real interesting question .
nn	No,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh .
sv	You know, I think that's what it's going to take, though.
sv	I really do.
sv	it's going to take all of us getting together,
aa	That's right,
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right,
ba	my gosh.
sv	I think you know being convicted is one thing, you know,
aa	Right,
sd	there can be no shadow of a doubt in my mind,
sv	So once, they've gotten the penalty and there is no doubt, do it, you know,
sv	I guess, I mean that sounds cold,
sv	and it's costing us a heck of a lot of money
sv	if the crime was bad enough that they were sentenced to death, then do it, you know,
ng	I didn't notice it,
ba	Gosh,
ba	man.
b	Yeah,
sv	I really beli ,
sv	If they're the kind of people that commit these , excuse me, grotesque crimes and have done it over and over and over again, you don't reform those kind of people.
aa	No,
qh	Well, if you're insane enough that you can go cut twelve people up into little bitty pieces and bury them in your back yard, then can, can you be helped, you know,
h	you know, I don't know,
sd	and I understand you know, that, you know,
nn	No.
nn	No,
b	really.
b	Yeah.
bh	really.
b^m	Yeah.
sd	We've had several here lately
ny	Yes,
sd	I think there's been like six or seven of them, over the last like probably eight or nine months.
ng^m	They don't kill them,
sd	and they're all like, like anywhere from nine to twelve years old, I think is what they've been.
sd	And he's taken them and raped them and then brought them right back and just kind of thrown them out of the car in their front yard.
sd	can you imagine, because it happens in the middle of the night,
bh	You know, can you imagine.
sd	Shoo , you know, I've got one of those in Brian's room.
sd	I never even thought about that.
sd	I hadn't even thought about it .
sv	Well it's really bad that you have to be, you know,
sd	and they were playing in the back yard
sd	And she didn't act like it bothered her at all,
sd	and I looked down both directions of the alley
sd	And you know, my heart was in my throat, you know,
sd	and, Brian was two houses down. You know,
h	I don't know,
sv	Parents around here just let their kids run everywhere,
ba	man, this is too scary, that is just too scary.
sd	You know, I let Brian play here in the back yard
sd	And one of the gates has a padlock on it
sd	you know, like come over, they'd have to come over the fence,
sd	And I still feel a little uneasy about him playing back there.
sd	You know, I mean, if I don't hear him playing, I mean, I get up and come out and look out the window real often, you know,
sv	It's really scary that you have to be that scared about your kids
sv	better safe than sorry.
^2	He could fry.
aa	yes,
b	You know,
sd	and I believe that,
sv	Because these little girls will never be the same.
sv	Never be the same,
sd(^q)	and he said you know if you ever get on a jury, you know, you're not told this, but if you ever get on a jury you can pretty much guess, whatever you sentence them to,
^q	they'll serve a quarter of it,
sv	so, if you want them to stay in prison for fifteen years, don't sentence them to fifteen years, sentence them to a hundred.
sd	You know, because then they'll serve fifteen or twenty, so. Which is really,
h	I don't know,
aa	No,
no	I don't know.
sv	That's the thing,
sv(^q)	and we're going to have to say, if you commit this crime and if we're sure you commit this crime, you are going to be sentenced to death period, period,
sv	and do it, you know.
^q	And if you commit this crime, you will be in prison for the rest of your life.
sv(^q)	We're not going to say we're going to put you there for the rest of your life and let you out in fifteen years,
sd	Well, I was watching a show about this the other night
sd	I usually don't get to hear any of the current events probably until about the ten o'clock news.
sd	I mean, by the time you get off work, go by and pick up the, baby from the baby sitter, it's, you know, after six
b	Uh huh,
b	uh huh.
sd	you know, I'll look over my husband's shoulder and see what's going on.
b	Yeah.
sd	And, it's pretty much headline news.
sv	Which isn't, you know, pretty much what we look for anyway.
sv	But, do you think that the quality of the, you know, the news events that you get are,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	And sometimes I think it too much trying to figure out who's going to get the best headlines. And that they'll run a topic into the ground.
sv	And, You know, they try to play public's opinion. Which I think is awful, because it usually works.
aa	Yes,
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
sv	you know, but we need good schools.
aa	No.
aa	Yeah.
aa	No.
sd	you know, I haven't seen the news in a couple of days.
b	Yes,
b	Yeah.
sv	and he'd have all these people jumping down his back, even though I'd agree with it.
aa	Yeah, it, it did a lot.
ny	Yeah,
sd	They were just north of it. Probably about a hundred fifty miles, hundred miles from the Kuwaiti border.
sd	it was a new situation.
aa	You're right,
na	We got some awful rain, the other morning.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bh	It did?
sd	well. we've just got slight chances of rain.
b	Oh .
b	Right,
sd	And, you walk out on the ground,
b	Yeah .
sd	Well, today I mean, the air was just so sticky, so damp.
ba	Goodness.
fc	Right.
fc	Right.
fc	All right.
sd	And I don't have elderly parents, yet but not that far in the distant future.
qy^d	A concern of yours right now.
qy	are they living independently, right now?
bk	Oh.
qy	Have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that?
ba	that sounds the ultimate.
sv	Well, even at that point, most care can be given in the home.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
^2	Really in need of a nursing home.
b	Right,
aa	Well, it's, you know,
sv	and then, of course, there is always the problem of being able to afford either of those solutions.
sv	And that, I think is what is scary,
b	Oh.
ba	goodness.
b	Oh.
sv	and then they could have done that well at home.
b	Oh.
sv	You hear these stories, all the time.
b	Right.
b	Oh.
b	Right.
ba	Well, good.
aa	yes.
aa	Exactly.
sv	As the situation is so sad because it just takes all the dignity away from, from people who have been independent all their lives.
sd	Like this was a really neat vital woman
sd	And oh I do not know what the answer is,
sv	if you, you know, have family that, you can live with.
aa	Right.
aa^m	Right.
sv	And, hopefully, they would have it so that you could go there anytime.
sv	Because if you could not go there anytime, then that would make you, a little bit su ,
aa	right.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes.
sd	we, it's a house we bought, about two and a half years ago now.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	First house.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qo	So what do you think of owning a home as opposed to renting somebody else's?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	is it a fairly large house?
ba	that's pretty good size.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It's tiny.
na	It's not much bigger.
ny	Yeah,
sd	Just one.
b	Yeah.
sd	I'd rather have more rooms and less space in each one I guess. Rather have lots of rooms and lots of space,
sd	Well, it's pretty typical, I mean, it's a very, very middle class neighborhood.
sd	and, lots of kids and stuff,
qy	is yours also pretty much in conformance with the neighborhood
qrr	or is it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
ba	my gosh.
b	Ooh.
aa	I'm sure, with eight,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	and his house actually ended up being nicer than lots in the neighborhood,
sd	He was a little surprised.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	Kind of depends on when they get in, you know.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, see, my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that, because they moved into a neighborhood and bought a real nice stone house down in South Austin.
sd	and, what the builder apparently plans to do, is they do phase one,
na	somewhat.
sd	but that's the way it goes.
br	What?
sd	State College,
b	Yep.
aa	Right,
b	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	I see.
b	Uh huh.
sd	 well, some of both.
sd	I read the newspapers sometimes
sd	and I watch C N N, that sort of thing occasionally
sd	and I read magazines, and such.
aa	Well, yeah,
sd	so I am interested in what's going on,
ny	and, yeah.
aa	Right,
b	Yep,
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's true.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bh	yeah?
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
b	Yep.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
aa	Right.
aa	Right,
aa	Well, that may be so,
sv	I think that I'm not always satisfied with how dig they deep into the how deep they dig into things and such.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, where I'm from the Atlantic coast conference is a very big conference
nn	No,
b	Right.
sd	So, hopefully we'll have a good year.
qy	Do you like professional basketball?
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, that's an up and coming team, though.
sv	That's somebody you can get behind and, be patient.
aa	Yeah,
sv	But, I think Chicago will probably with the N B A again.
ny	Yeah,
aa	That's true.
aa	That's true,
b	Yeah,
sv	It's a long season.
b	Yeah.
fc^m	Good to talk to you.
fc	Bye bye.
