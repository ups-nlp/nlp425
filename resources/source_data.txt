fp	and I'm calling from Garland, Texas.
co^t	so. anyway, let me press one.
sd	and, it was an experience that I won't do again .
sd	We saw people we hadn't see in a while
sd(^q)	and we're going, my gosh.
b	Yeah.
aa	I think you're right.
b	Yeah.
qw^d	Your family's from where?
ba	no.
b	Uh huh.
ba	those are nice.
sv	And I'm sure they're a lot more organized too, because they've done it before.
ba	That's great.
b	Yeah.
ba	well that's great.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	more people want to come back again.
ba	that's good.
sd	and, it sounds really neat, it really does.
b	Yeah.
sd	and they have a really good for the whole weekend.
qy	so, do you own a P C?
qy^d	But you have one at work.
sd	see I'm doing my, Master's in Computer Science and Computer Engineering.
sd	but I have to use them, like especially during my undergrad.
sv	You know, like it's easier for you to go to and run a program, you know, through the disk, because, the grader can do it at home.
sv	and you have to have so many people sharing the same data, that you can't use personal computers, so you have to use, you know, a main frame.
bk	okay.
qy	But does it have, like, a disk drive?
sd	because, the ones that we use, you know, are like UNIX base systems.
sd	And, so they don't have a disk drive.
sd	the only way that you can do it is through a modem.
sd	And, you know, you just do it that way.
sd	you can't store it anywhere.
bk	okay.
bf	And then you also have to do all your grading on the P C.
bk	okay.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, for us you know, it's like for doing like, you know, like resumes, and, presentations.
sd	We use like for example, a Mackintosh, which is a lot easier for graphics, than you know, the I B M P C's or anything compatible with that.
sd	due to the fact that, well, you know, I haven't tested the P S two yet.
sd	but I don't know if the software is as easily, you know, like you can manage it a lot easier than the old one.
sd	The old one you had to go pick a line, use little arrows to go onto the screen and check where you wanted to start, and where, you know, with the mouse you do it, you know, like, a hundred times faster.
sd	and that's the way it's going to print out.
sd	And, especially if you have a laser printer, it's going to print out the same way as it's on the screen.
sd	And, so, you know, with the I B M what would happen is, since the software that I had was, it was basically, you know, you only see part of the page.
sd	And, so, the whole page you never can actually see it,
sd	and, you know, it's like, every time that you have to do something it's really a pain.
sd	it's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a P C.
sd	You know, like years back when you didn't have that you would have to map out all these numbers.
sd	and get a graph which you weren't sure if it was okay or not, you know.
sd	But, with a new system I can calculate everything so fast, you know, like for spread sheets.
sv	You can see what the trend is over the years.
b	Yeah,
sd	and the other one I had the program running. so if there was ever a mistake, I could easily check, you know,
sd(^q)	I could look at the program and say, this is where I made the error.
sd(^q)	Instead of saying, where did I make the error?
sd	the old ones you had to go out of your program, well load up the program again, in this case.
sd	After you load it up change it, hope that's right, get out of that, run the program, run, uh huh, as long as it took, and then go back and see if that worked or not.
sd	and say it messed up in line fifty four.
sd	and you can see where it messed up, because, you know it's like in the old computers, the ones that, we're using here a couple of years ago, you would always have to have a printout, every time that you ran your program, * end of slash unit? you would need a printout because everything else was erased in the background. / * should have been new slash unit
qy	did, did you learn it in computer science?
qw	And, when was this.
bk	okay.
sd	I know because, all I know is that when I came here in eighty seven, it was the last year to put all your punch cards in.
sd(^q)	and they go, my God, they're still using this.
sd	and, you know , You can get a hard copy of it,
sd	and that's about it.
sd	They said that, if the auto industry would have kept the same trend as the computer industry has ever since, you know, it started, they said that, cars would cost two dollars
sd	and they would run forever.
sd(^q)	it's like, yeah, you know, when your, car runs out of gas just throw it away.
sv	And, that's the way it would be.
sd	an I B M P C in like in nineteen eighty one it would cost you five thousand dollars,
sd	and now you can get it, you know, like for, one thousand dollars, you know, because of the parts basically.
sd(^q)	they're not charging you, you know, over pricing, it because it's like, if we sell it for less, you know, it's like we're losing money, you know.
sd(^q)	It's like we want to sell it to break even at least.
sd	And, I think they stopped producing the I B M P C.
sd	and the, P C Junior was a total failure, to them.
sd(^q)	it's like, sure bring out. N , into the market something that's smaller when nobody uses anything that's smaller than, you know, this, you know.
sd	and, Mackintosh took a lot of the market from a lot of schools.
sv	you can work with it a lot easier.
ad	well, I'll leave you back to your work.
fx	And, have a good lunch.
qo	How about yourself?
aa	True.
b*	Huh uh.
sv	my personal opinion is that the various network news medias were trying to interpret the news to the best of their abilities since they were not very well informed by the military.
sd	Now, I can appreciate that, especially after what happened in Vietnam.
sv	today's, means of communication, a newscaster could very well giveaway a piece of top secret information. And, pat himself on the back for, making a good scoop.
sd	I find T News very enlightening, too.
sd	Of course, with that goes along with the stock price of T I.
sd	Of course, T NEWS is more or less headlines,
sd	I don't think much of their sports coverage.
sd	Only give the scores.
sd	outside of pro football, I'm not too interested in other games, other sports, anyway.
sv	I think they do a pretty good job of selecting the most important items.
b*	Huh uh.
sd	and I know what it takes to get some of those little bits and pieces of news on the air,
sd	One of the fellows got mixed up in a riot that was going on down there,
sd	they left him alone.
aa*	Huh uh.
nn	No.
sd^t	Well I'll be looking for it then.
bh	Is that right?
o@	Well, good. * slash error You, too.
sd	I was thinking about whether or not we should have people, be required to do public service for a year or two.
sv	I mean, you can't make it everybody.
sv	But then you need to make it sure that the rich people can't buy somebody off and maybe send them in their places or get out of it some other way too.
^g	right.
sv	and they all had to pass.
sv	I thought it a good idea too, though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money.
sv	so they could subsist.
b	Yeah.
sv	So what we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country.
sd	I'm just teasing .
sv	and children from their countries came over to ours too, a trade off.
aa	Yeah.
sd	And other than that, I can't think of any other ideas.
bf	with W P A.
b	Yeah.
sd	And we're still using those things too.
sd^r	We're still using those things.
sd	They built lodges before too, like at Caddo Lake.
sd^r	Caddo Lake.
sd	it crosses into both of them.
sd	it's like a swamp.
sd	You know with all the Spanish moss on the trees, it's eerie.
qw	where are you from?
sd^t	I talked to somebody from Ohio the other night.
sd	I can't remember.
sd	Mitch Snider, I don't know who Mitch Snider is.
b	Yeah.
qw^t	What have your other topics been?
sd(^q)^t	It was what meal would you cook for, special dinner .
qh	How far can you go with that one,
^q^t	and what do you think has caused some of the social problems.
^q^t	and what should we do about it?
aa	right.
^2	Because we don't have much coal.
sd	In Virginia.
qw^t	well how did you get into this program.
qy^d	For T I.
b^m	No.
qy^t	So does your company have something to do with T I.
b	Huh,
qy^t	And do you know how long this is supposed to go on.
sd^t	but then it seems like it might be longer than a week.
qw^t	So what do you think we're going to get?
qw^r^t	What do you think we're going to get for this?
qy^d^t	prizes.
qy^t	Do you know anybody that's ever done this?
sd^t	I know T I gets prizes.
sd	I'm not T I.
aa	Huh uh.
sd^t	and she saw this on her computer and thought it might be neat,
sd^t	so she ran off copies of the thing.
sd^t	And I just signed up for it.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And it shouldn't be too good right now anyway, because they've been laying off so many people.
sv^t	so we're footing the bill on our taxes.
fc	bye.
sd	Well I'm going to try to clean up the house after my two children for about an hour see if we can walk around.
fc	Bye.
sd	and so I really don't receive any benefits right now .
sd	and and, right now we have probably some excellent benefits right now.
sd	but we're real happy with them.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and, and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices on who to go with.
sd	and it's worked out really good for us too.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba^r	That's really good.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Worked out really well for us too.
qy	Well is there anything else that you look for
sv	you've put a lot of the main points in.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ad^t	Tell me about your ideas on this, the U S government supporting health insurance and so forth.
qw	Well what is this going to do the insurance companies who are supporting this work now and hopefully are doing, a good job?
aa	Yes.
sv	matter of fact, in some respects their life might depend on it.
sv	But, by the same token some of these charges they make for well, minor endeavors, shall we say on the parts the doctors are really out of line.
sv	and they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it.
sd	My wife and I both have had that recently.
b	Yeah.
sd	See, that bothers me about the government see,
qr	Do you think that that these insurance things should be covered on a State basis or U S government basis?
sd^t	there we go.
qy	So, do you play golf at all?
sd	Actually, I don't.
sd	so I just stopped playing.
sv	that is real good.
bf	so you have been playing,
sd^e	actually, I don't even know if I checked that or not, to be perfectly honest. .
h	I don't know.
sd	I forget which one it was.
sd	It wound up tossing the ball into the trees, virtually every time.
sd	I was slicing, actually.
sd	And, as it turns out, I went and took some lessons for awhile, because I just, would lose so many balls, and, make it a horrible time for everybody.
sd	And I, And I still have this slice ,
sd	I'm a graduate student,
ny	Yes.
sd	As a matter of fact, I don't have time to do much else, except for graduate work.
sd	so I hang around this way,
sd	a bunch of us were pretty avid golfers. Golfers, so we will go out
sd	and we will, we will play, you know.
sd	when I go on vacation, my father and I, play a little bit.
sd	we play a par three, nine hole course.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	But, those are, still not you favorite,
ba	wow, .
sv	You must be very busy.
sd	Miniature golf, there's my game.
sd	Miniature golf, there you go, putt, putt.
sd	I don't recall anymore.
sd	we had the,
sd	We have a very good one called Locust Hill though.
sd	the L P G A comes here every year the Rochester International.
sd	And then we had a P G A, actually, a very big P G A, tour stop here, last year.
sd	but, they say the course is, is, is pretty tough, pretty challenging.
sd	but, it's exceedingly well kept, apparently.
sd	the grounds keepers were absolutely wonderful about, getting things back up again.
sd	actually, when the, when the L P G A came here I guess that was about a week and a half ago, it, it takes over the whole town.
sd	and lots and lots of people take off work, to go to go an watch the, ladies , play.
sd	So, I mean, I think it's absolutely wonderful to see.
b	Yeah,
sd	and you sort of stink, like me,
sv	and you sort of play every now and then.
sd	And, And, and I can not, and I can not hit a golf ball .
sd(^q)	That's because he's probably doing what I do, worrying about, is my head straight, is my arm right, is this correct, am I holding correctly, stuff like that. * slash error Yeah, / * slash error
aa	yeah.
aa	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I have this nasty habit of turning my head at the last second, or, or just keeping my arm wrong.
qy	Is it?
aa	exactly.
sd	It took me a long time to learn to wait until the ball was in the air before I looked up.
^2	driver.
b	Yeah.
bf	Watch where it's going.
bd	it's no big deal.
sd^t	Both.
sd^t	I believe so.
sd^t	I get a random reimbursement every now and then and don't really don't really figure it out, until afterward .
b	really.
sd^t	I have been doing this for awhile, actually.
na	It seems like it's been a while.
sd^t	And I just, get these random checks in the mail every now and then
sd^t	My wife and I both do it, as a matter of fact.
sd^t	and, To be honest, I really have not been accounting,
sd^t	I just sort of figured, well, it's going to work.
sv	an interesting topic.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Boy, you and my husband would have a whole lot in common .
b	Uh huh.
bh	really.
qw	how old is your car?
b	Oh.
b	Right.
qw	So what do the Miatas run?
sv	Well, that's not too bad.
sd	I've never driven one.
br	Huh?
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	And so you've done this?
bk	Okay.
b	Oh .
bh	Really?
sd	Whatever my husband buys .
sd^r	so it just, wasn't me, you know.
sd	And then, I'd want a minivan .
sd	Because I'm with the kids all the time.
b	Yeah.
sd	You pick up I pick up my little one from preschool
sd	and the whole parking lot's full of minivans.
sd	But, you know, I drive a little Subaru.
sd	but I just wanted to hold on to it cause I just really enjoy that.
sd	And, that's really all I needed was for something just to go here and there and back.
b	Uh huh.
b	really.
sd	We went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan. And pulled the little trailer behind.
qy	The pop up trailer?
sv^r	so it's really amazing how much a minivan can do.
sv	they're not.
b	Yeah.
sd	We do a lot of traveling. By car.
sd	But it really didn't cause our kids are still little.
sd	Other than that, it got terrible mileage
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd^t	Here we go.
sd^e	Two years ago I spent some Fourth of July to Labor Day on a jury that was, a change of venue from Columbus, Ohio for aggravated, murder and kidnapping.
sd	it was quite a session that disrupted my whole summer, of course, five days a week,
sd	but it was an absolutely fascinating experience.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	it was the first time in the state of Ohio that, D N A testing was entered as evidence.
sd	the judge was being especially careful that everything was done correctly so there couldn't be a mistrial of any kind.
sd	Actually it was fourteen because we had two alternates.
sd	And the judge was extremely concerned for our welfare, if we were comfortable, and, things of that nature which made us feel good.
sd	but the makeup of the jury, was truly you might say a cross section of a country.
sd	one was a former student of mine a few years before who was out of work.
sd	So, we had quite a cross section of black, white and women and men.
sd	and I thought that that was a failing because, from the standpoint that it was difficult to try to remember everything,
sd	and he was right, there also.
sv,o@	I think it depends upon how the judge handles the case, and if the criminal chooses to have a a three judge panel I should say, I think he can, * Seems that a 2nd slash unit should begin at "and if the criminal . . ." have that rather than trial by jury.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	You're kidding.
sv	and money.
sv	but I also feel, as you said, that the original concept of the jury as it was originally setup, back, a hundred years ago was fine but that it needs to be more refined for today's standard of living and the, level of education of so many people now,
sd	and then he wasn't selected on the jury.
sd	And, you know, some of it just seemed rather extreme.
b	Right.
sv	well, I guess he'd have to be careful with entrapment or some of those things,
sd	I assume you have seen on television recently, as probably the whole country has, the beating of the man in Los Angeles.
sv	and it's just a stroke of luck, that someone was able to get it on tape and then, to listen to the tape recording, at the police station of the whole conversation afterwards.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, we get a few other case, like up at the end of last year where one police officer, it was on a drug raid, was trying to extricate, a confession or information from a drug dealer and did so by placing a hot iron on his bare chest, burned him.
sd	and then last week someone shot and killed the former policeman.
sv	and we just need more discipline country wide.
fc^t	and, good luck on calls.
fc	Bye bye.
qw	What are your favorite T V shows?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	My wife and I both like COMMISH.
sd	around here at least.
sd	I guess it depends on what channel you're getting. You know, what system you're getting it through.
sv	it seems to be kind of halfway between, something like ALL IN THE FAMILY and, HILL STREET BLUES.
sv	it's a good show.
b	Yeah.
sv	he's tender hearted fellow.
sd	I think that's what first drew us to him, the, the relationship between he and his wife kind of looks a lot like ours.
b	 Yeah,
sd	I know we watch COMMISH any chance we get.
sv	it's gotten more and more to where they are so totally against, anything spiritual.
sd	I used to be a real big fan of STAR TREK.
ny	pretty much, yeah.
sd	I always enjoyed the show anyway .
sd	And STAR TREK's in a s , or the, STAR WARS set
qy^d	one of the first STAR WARS movie?
sd	I think I watched it like nineteen times.
sd	Anyway, I was a pretty big fan of that sort of thing.
sd	used to read a lot of science fiction work, too.
sd	but I don't know if you heard them or not, I got a twelve year old, twelve week old baby.
sd	between that and school it's not ,
sd	Between him and school, there's not much time left for watching much T V.
sd	And we're both full time students
b	Yeah.
qr	What are you hoping for, a boy or a girl?
sv,qy^g@	that's, that's the best way, you haven't found out yet or anything, have you? / * Looks like this should be 2 slash units, with their respective labels shown here.
sv^r	That's the best way.
sv	I mean, you know, It's not as much fun.
sd	I'm about half kid at heart anyway.
sv	well, a couple of the, ones Disney's doing aren't too bad
aa	yeah.
sv	the, the worst of the violence in the FLINTSTONES was when somebody gave Fred a poke in the snoot.
sv	But, shoot, I mean, blowing up galaxies and and putting a curse on the whole planet, or, or you know, on you know, everything of this species, you know, just all kinds of crud .
sv	everything's mutations and and killing
sv	and, Gone are the days of those things they use ,
sd	what was it T N, Turner Broadcasting Network used to, do the Saturday morning and Sunday morning cartoons, the old cartoons. They used to put between the first and second feature at the theatre.
sd	Those old little ten minute jobs where, the real ballooned looking art work, you know
fa	I'm sorry,
sd	We take, you know, the DALLAS MORNING NEWS daily, and the Plano paper daily
sd	and, you know, after a month of that you got a ton, of newspapers.
aa	It really does,
sd	I do recycle, newspapers and, glass.
sd	so we don't have, you know, six thousand plastic milk jugs, a month, you know.
b	Yeah.
sd	But you know there is a place you can take those also you know at the same place just put them in a different, container.
sd	the city is going to leave, receptacles at people's home.
aa	It, certainly would
sd	and then the, you know, trash guys will pick it up. Which would really be handy, you know, for people like shut ins, or, people who can't or don't drive, you know,
sd	they can't get to the these centers.
sv	And I'm sure rather than try to, ask someone to take them for them they probably just pitch them, you know?
sv	But I think that's probably a good idea.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	yes.
b	Yeah.
ba	Great .
ba	I bet it was.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's just a matter of education, I think.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
aa	that's right.
sd	I hope it works.
aa^r	absolutely.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
sd	and it's amazing how much stuff just the two of us generate,
sd	you know, I can imagine a family of, you know, four or five.
aa	It really does.
sd	I really hadn't thought about it to tell you the truth.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
sd	you know I'm not personally involved because you know, I don't have any children that wear diapers,
sd	but I'm sure it creates a large amount of, you know, refuse.
aa	That's right.
aa	Absolutely.
aa^r	absolutely.
b	Uh huh.
sd	there is a receptacle, you know, at the centers also for aluminum,
sd	but again we don't generate that much
sd	we don't,
b	Yeah.
sd	ninety nine percent of ours is newspaper and, you know, glass.
sd	Car batteries.
b	Uh huh.
sd	so I don't, don't have that problem.
b	Yeah.
sd*	well we do to as a matter of fact. / * typo too
b	Right.
sd	we have one of those in town.
sd	one of their major fund raisers is, you know, a garage sale.
sd	it's called the Clothes Closet,
sd	that's what it's called here in Plano.
aa	Right.
aa	Uh huh.
sd	And they distribute them to the people, that need them.
b	Yeah.
sd	I can't either ,
sd^r	I really can't either.
fc	well, it was nice talking to you.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	since living in Dallas it's always so hot, in the summertime, I just, wear lots of shorts, because I don't work during the day.
qy	So, do you work?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	so, you know, I just wear you know, my shorts and stuff like that.
sd	I don't go out and spend lots of money on, different, you know, suits and stuff, you know.
sd	so you know, I had more suits and stuff then
sd	Worry about all that kind of stuff .
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bf	moved from, Winter.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, You know, I've got all these clothes that I never wear, because you can't wear them here.
sd	You have so much summer.
sd	And, so then when you know, I finally get a chance to go out with my husband it's like a real chore to find something nice to wear .
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bf	You hate to get rid of it, because you know how much you spent on them.
sd	And it's real hard to get rid of some of that stuff, I know.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
sd	right now my clothes come from Target, you know .
sd	and they're wadded up in a ball.
sd	I'm so glad to meet somebody that their iron board is their permanent fixture in their house.
sd	but my ironing board is part of my decor
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd(^q)	but it's like, I just don't want to do it ,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	, that's an idea.
b	Yeah.
sd	if I know I'm having somebody come over to the house and there's a possibility they might be going back into my room, I will put it away,
sd	but I iron our clothes as we go along,
aa	no.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	You can't iron it all
sd	they can't decide what they want to wear so they, change their minds, you know, I know, I mean my oldest is only four,
sd	but she's still changes her mind two or three times, before she figures out what she's going to wear
sd	And then they never put anything back.
sv(^q)@	that, that's called smart, you know, we don't do that kind of stuff, you know. * Seems this should end in a slash That's called too easy on mom. / * See note above; this would seem to be an indep. slash unit
^q	Our lot in life is to make her life miserable
sd(^q)	It's like, it's easy, you just do it, you know.
b	Uh huh.
sd	My husband wouldn't know where to hang his dirty clothes.
o	You know.
sd	He wouldn't know where to put things
b	Yeah
fc	it was nice talking with you, too.
fc	Bye bye.
qw	so what would be your favorite meal to cook?
b^m^g	Don't like to cook, huh?
b^m^g	Make a mean spaghetti, huh?
qy	got kids?
qy	married?
b	Yeah.
sd	so don't do much cooking for him yet.
sd^t	and, what kind of dishes you might have for it, or some sort of thing like that.
sd	I suppose it would just about depend on who was coming, I guess.
sd	If it was pretty informal about anything.
qw	How do you usually cook your deer?
qw^r	How do you usually cook your deer?
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	I imagine.
ba^r	I would imagine it is.
ba	I understand.
sd	We just had, deer stew sort of it was deer steak stew. well , about a day, day and a half in the crock pot, some deer steaks in kind of a mushroom gravy.
sd	some veggies in it.
nn	No.
sd^e	the times I've been out deer hunting, I can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa.
sd^e	this was given to us by some friends.
sd	guy was in a hunting club
sd	and then at the end of the day, they split it
sd	and the rest of it is split with the rest, with everybody in the group.
sd	they went out last year and almost everybody got it, the limit
sd	so everybody had deer coming out their ears.
sd	about eight months ago they gave it to us.
sd	or we'll, you know, put it out on the grill so that, the bulk of the tallow will dribble off of it.
b	Yeah.
sv^r	Deer spaghetti is real good.
sd	I think if I was going to have a dinner party, I'd probably have, sandwiches or something along those lines and then, you know, just something light finger food sort of something or, Or maybe have something roasting out on the fire.
sd	Usually it's, one other couple come over for a dinner.
sd	we had a turkey loaf.
sd	scalloped potatoes.
sd	mashed potatoes.
sd	Mashed potatoes with, cheese melted over the top of them.
aa	Yeah,
sd	I've been fighting my weight since I was about ten years old.
sd	but I just feel that ,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
sv	that is a consequence,
b	Right.
sv	Well maybe that's something that needs to be worked on.
qy	was that the man that claimed he was abused
ba	yeah.
b	Yeah.
qw	How long was that?
ba	Boy.
sd	You know, it's not used that often you know. At least here in Texas
sv	I really do .
b	Yeah.
aa^r	right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	My sister and I were wondering about this recently because an old friend of ours in California, this happened about a week ago.
h	I don't know .
na	Right.
aa	I think you're right.
aa	Yes.
sd	Gary Gilmore.
b	Yeah.
sd	and we still have a death penalty.
sd	I guess we have the longest, running inmates for death row too.
sd	And then we had another guy, Ronald Lafferty, that thought God told him to kill his sister in law.
sd	He just got a new trial because, the judge felt that he was incompetent.
qo	how do you feel about the death penalty?
b	Oh.
sv	Well, I'm sure that's .
sv	but, terrorism definitely. And selling out your country.
sv	it's got to be something that is going to cost them, because we never lock anybody up forever.
sd	We've got these guys in New York that, I'm sure you heard about, the ones that killed, the gentleman that came from Utah to watch the tennis people.
sd	And I guess they got convicted, the four, of murder.
qy^d	So you've come to a definite opinion on it now?
bf	You kind of hate to,
qy	You mean violence?
sv	I think that people who, infringe on other people's rights, and screw up their whole lives with rape, child molesting, terrorism, just
sd	but I'm for it for certain reasons.
sv	And I think that things like rape, you can't get over, it takes a lifetime.
nd	if it was, Yeah.
sv	and, if they're habitual, like three times caught for rape or child molesting then snuff them.
br	Pardon?
sv	That isn't a place of rehabilitation.
qy^g	it's a tough question, isn't it, on whether, at what point do they become so detrimental to society that society can't afford to keep them around to keep giving them chances.
o	Set.
qy^g^t	you got the topic, right?
qw	well, where in Dallas are you?
qy	So you do recycling there?
b	Uh huh.
qy	do you know?
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I'm in Dallas proper in the city of Dallas
sd	So they're not picking up anything .
sd	We've got all these boxes in our garage for, you know, green glass and clear glass and plastic and everything.
sd	there's a lot of places to take, like the plastic, shopping bags like most of the grocery stores.
sd	You know, it would still be more convenient than what we have now.
qw	Where is that?
sd	I'm, I'm, I'm just, I'm north of Addison actually.
sd	So I'm really
sd	s , I'm in Dallas, but only technically .
b	Yeah.
sd	I've seen those.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, you get something .
sd	but, again, that's another stop
sd	and so hopefully they'll do it soon.
sd	That would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week
sd	that would be great.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Right.
qrr	or do they take the whole thing?
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
^g	right?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, and they take cans, now, too. Which is great.
sd	And, In fact this past year, we got all of our money for the Christmas tree because we saved cans for the entire year.
sd	And it worked out really well.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	you got any hobbies that you want to talk about?
qw	What in the world do you do with your computer that takes so much time?
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's good.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I, play trombone in the Plano Community Band.
sd	And I, like to do a lot of bicycling when the weather allows, and during summer when there's daylight savings time's when I get out and bike.
sd	Well, it wasn't too bad, other than the Cowboys didn't do so hot.
sv	the Lions are pretty good, I'm afraid, a lot better team than the Cowboys were today.
sd	but I always go back to it .
ba	I understand that.
sv	Well, you do lots of stuff.
sd	I cover Texas and Oklahoma.
sd	I got customers in Oklahoma City and Tulsa and Perry, Oklahoma and Eda and all that way.
sd	about thirty three thousand miles a year.
sd	so that isn't too bad.
sd	but we only average about forty to fifty people you know, usually.
aa	Yeah.
sd	It's fun.
sd	I sing in a church choir on Wednesday nights when I'm around, and play in the band on Monday nights, and keeps you out of trouble that way.
sd^t	Jerry, the topic was favorite T V shows, and what kind are you interested in, and how they, and do they differ from like mine.
b	Right.
sd	I'm sort of a movie buff.
sd	and a lot of times I will, go out and take a lunch hour, go to lunch from like twelve to two, go to a movie and just come back to my office.
sd	and I'm pretty much of a junk movie watcher by myself.
sd	If I take my wife, then we see something a little nicer, you know.
sd	and I'll turn on the tube set there and have my coffee or Coke or whatever and a little T V
sd	and sometimes I set there all evening.
ba^r	you bet.
sv	Well, that's an interesting channel.
sd	and, you know I like my sports and everything
sd	and I left at halftime
sv	They just did an excellent job.
b^m	the Eagles
sv	luck into it now, I think.
sv	Cowboys, they earned it on their own merit.
sd	as much as everyone, you know, used the word, love Tom Landry, I'm glad that Jimmy Johnson's there.
aa	It was.
sv	I think he would have stayed there four or five more years until he could have gone out
sv	it's, you know he earned his stripes.
sv	he's a winner in anyone's book
sd	and I hope he's a winner in his own book, you know because that's the key there.
sv	but, you know, this ring of honor thing, you know, he needs to be there because he's earned it.
sd	and he won't do that yet.
sd	So. I hope he makes up his mind to do it, because he needs to be remembered.
aa^r	no.
h	let's put it that way.
sd	and I feel like a native.
bh	did you.
b	Yeah.
sd	we came down from New York state in seventy four, and never had any regrets at all.
sd	It's been.
sd	and I've got my last kid graduating from college this next December
sd	she's getting married the month before in November,
sd	I will be finished with that.
b	Right.
ba	Well, good.
sd^e	not at all.
sd^t	I guess tonight's subject is to discuss current events and how we keep up on current events, and if we're satisfied with the, coverage that we receive.
qo	how about yourself?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	right.
bk	Okay.
qy^g	It's historic events, huh.
bk	okay.
aa	Yes.
b	Yeah.
sv	And it'd be refreshing once in a while to hear some good news.
sv	we do.
aa^r	true.
sv	and quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing
sv	I guess the economy is effecting also the news media
sv	and I think that nowadays with communications the way they are also, that we can see global events happening as they occur all over the world, like the,
sv	you know, twenty years ago, thirty years ago, we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege or luxury to view that.
ba	yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qw	what did you buy?
br	I'm sorry, what?
bh	really.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
sd	if I had the money, I think I would love to own a, a B M W.
sv	It seems like they last forever.
sv	I don't know, they're not as nice looking.
sd	but everyone I've seen is kind of plain,
sd	Sherman.
qw	Where are you?
b	Yeah.
sd	my actual favorite cars were, like the Ford Thunderbirds of nineteen eighty five.
sd	but I don't own one of those either .
sd	Mercury Topaz.
sd	cheap taste in cars, okay .
sd,o@	they're all right, it's, it's a good car, * Looks like A.37 and 39 should = 3 slash units I mean, I've never had any problem with it. / * See parsing note above
fa	Sorry I roped on Volvos then .
fa^r	Sorry I roped on Volvos then.
sd	See I don't much about them I guess.
b	Yeah.
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I don't like Japanese cars,
h	so, I don't know.
qy^d	I guess this is your first time to buy American,
b	Yeah.
b	Really.
b	Yeah.
br	Where?
bk	Okay.
sd	and the people, wouldn't reimburse them for anything.
br	What.
b	Oh.
sd^t	just about a week.
ny^r	yeah.
b	Really.
ba	wow.
fc	you too.
ft	thanks.
sd	Lucille, I'm on .
qy^t	did you hear our topic?
sd^t	basketball.
sd	I'm a Dallas Maverick fan.
sv	It just seems like they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possibly be a final team playing for all of it.
sd	National championship or the world championship, and something like this happens.
sv	I think that probably be evident with the more and more young guys they draft.
sd	so being a transplanted Texan in the Dallas area, I have to stick with those Dallas Mavericks.
sd^e	we do. You know.
sd	and when my kids got to a certain age and went off to school and college and doing their own thing, sort of gets boring going by yourself .
aa	you bet.
sv	they trade the nucleus of their power right now.
sv	Donald Carter, the owner, I think with all he's invested, he deserves a a healthy team for one year and a good break also.
sv	This thing with Roy Tarpley just upset everyone, I think. Fans, owners, management, everyone.
sv	I think they're fools if they ever bring him back .
sd	I just would not believe him any more.
aa	No.
^q	but you can't make him drink.
sv	But to be making a million dollars a year, that's pretty sad.
sd	and now he's probably an old age of, twenty five or six and making all that money,
sv	well, that's quite a, that's a little more of a challenge for a young man than they need at that point in their life, I think.
qy	Do you play?
na	Well, I'm into it.
qy	Is anybody?
bh	Really?
b	Right.
sd	and then, I got on to a team in high school but wasn't very good still. and then quit for awhile
sd	and, I've been playing, you know, off and on when I can.
sd	Up in Minneapolis it's not too easy to play in the winter of course
sd	so, I'll be going back down there in May and hopefully be picking it up a little more regularly.
aa	I was going to say .
sv	that's true, all too many times.
sd	Fortunately, down where I live in Florida, there's some golf courses that are pretty reasonable if you know where to look.
sd	one of them is the University of Florida golf course which is open to the public
sd	and that's pretty good.
qy	Can you get like a student discount type of thing
qw	what, what are green fees run there?
sd	that's about the same I guess as it is in Florida.
ba	that's super.
b	uh huh.
ba	Well, that's the way to do it though.
sv	That's the way to get in some good practice without having to pay for it all the time .
b	Yeah.
sv	Because once the guy hits the ball and they got to try to follow the ball that's a little difficult.
sv	but like you said, it's kind of boring actually.
bh	yeah?
sv	I bet that would be .
sv(^q)	you know, looking at it on T V, you're thinking, man, what a boring thing, you know.
sd	I'll have to see if I can't get a chance to go,
b	Right.
qw	What do you do for a living?
bh	you are?
qw	which university?
qw	What are you going into?
qy^g	Definitely not golf, right ?
qw	what was what was that movie that they had out?
sd	and I can't remember.
sd	It was on network T V a couple of times.
ny	Yeah.
sv	that's a good thing.
sd	and, fortunately, I've been able to play some golf on a student budget which is real helpful, you know.
sd	You hear about Japan. I guess, you know, it's like two hundred fifty dollar minimum or three hundred dollar minimum just like to practice even .
b	Yeah.
sd	I guess they have those, driving ranges that are actually stacked one on top of the other.
sd	They were into it.
sd	I'm from Dallas.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Richardson does.
sd	they started with newspapers and, of course aluminum cans, and and bottles and plastic.
sd	I didn't know there were different types of plastic, though.
b	Oh.
bk	okay.
b	Yeah.
sd	It seems to be made out of something different.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
bf	Lunch bags.
b	Right.
sd	they do.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
nn	no.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
sv	they'll run out of space before long.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	yeah.
sv	They don't even know that paper comes from trees now,
b^m	How do you grow paper?
^q	And how do you grow aluminum?
b	Right.
sd^t	And we are to just discuss what substances do you think that contribute most to air pollution, as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us.
qy	does your work entitle, anything of environmental along these lines?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	I work in environmentals, projects right now.
sd	And so the Sherman deal lost a lot of hair over that project.
sd	what we run into, is we have the Texas Air Control Board, T A C B, that send out, jurisdictions under which we have to, reply to.
ad	look what we've done here at T I.
sd	this is our side a , allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage.
sd	It's in, in, in tons per year.
sd	We, are very, aware of the opacity, which is the thickness of a stack emissions.
sd	So it's a full time, everybody has their home phone number type of job.
sd	It's been pitched to the Sherman City Council with, open arms, as well as the public.
sd	and, Tom Jones, our corporate environmental guys handle the project.
sd	I think it's just a matter of fund, funds right now as I understand it.
sd	It will have something coming out of the stackhouse it was, it was human nature.
sd	and, it's an interesting job.
am	Possibly.
b	Uh huh.
sd	we have duckwork and all those type of interesting pieces of equipment where, they have, that we sample
sd	And we mix it with concrete and actually, potash, per se, and concrete and then actually put it in the ground. But not in a hazardous waste location because it's, basically, a concrete slab.
sd	I've enjoyed speaking with you,
sd	I was responsible for all the planning and engineering over the corporate, or in the north building .
ny	Yeah.
o	So, I hope you like your office.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, I think what changed everything is, y'all were the only ones that make any money for TI, here in the last ten years, Ju ,
sv	And that's, when you start, when you start paying your way, you know, Jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys.
fc	I've enjoyed speaking with you.
fc	Bye bye.
sd^t	we're going to talk about lawn and garden today.
qrr	or do you wish to discuss that?
sd	we're neighbors.
b	Okay .
ad	Can you hang on just a minute?
fa	I'm sorry.
ad	Go ahead.
sd	I get a lot of good tips from him.
sd	I have his book, too.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	Not in Texas.
b	Uh huh.
sd(^q)	and I said, huh uh ,
^q	I can do it much cheaper and better.
sd	and it's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over the territory.
sd(^q)	And, I thought, well, I'm going to do this all the time.
sd	and I took them to a certified, nurseryman the other day,
qh	and do you know what he told me I needed to do?
^q	this is unreal.
sd	So, I think I'll get my son in law to do that for me, if he will.
sd	and I don't know, what happened to it,
sd^r	one is, , a maple,
sd	I think it's not a native Texan tree.
sd	and they don't, get any care,
sd	and they're just beautiful.
sd	and, you know, and, although I don't have too serious a problem,
sd	and you know, Sperry said, you know, that's what happened to the Crepe Myrtles, the last two years that, we are looking at all the freeze damage from the prior two years.
sd	So, I kind of think that maybe that, happened to these large trees that I have.
sv	but, that's one of the hazards I guess of, having a yard.
b	Uh huh.
sv	the quick growing,
b	uh huh
sd	I don't know how to get rid of these big trees, because one has a circumference of about ten inches,
b	Oh.
sd	Because you still have to ,
b	Uh huh.
bf	a stump killer.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I think it's some kind of a screwing thing that just rips it right out.
 %	yeah.
b	Sure.
bf	A blessing in disguise.
bf	I mean, two fold purpose.
sd^e	I have a self propelled, Snapper.
sd	and it, and it's very difficult to address.
sv	They're very expensive.
fe	booey
sv	they always try to give you a song and dance.
sd^t	but, it's camping.
qo	How about yourself?
b	Uh huh.
sv	I bet it's pretty over there.
qw	What do you think, what kind of camping, are you talking about?
qrr	or do you actually put up a tent
bf	so you have,
ny	Yeah.
qy^g	A pop up trailer, huh.
sd	We have a tent.
sd^e	So I guess we really rough it.
sd	I've camped, basically almost anywhere, even to the point where we've had to backpack in and everything you carried in was what you had to use to sustain you for that camping trip and had to pack it back out.
sd	But since I've been married and with a family, we have to go where there's restrooms . And playgrounds, and so forth,
sd	We recently moved from the Rocky Mountain area up in, northern Utah down to here because of work, and, haven't been able to enjoy fishing like I used to up there, which is, clear water fishing and streams and rivers.
sd	but mainly what we did was we did a lot of hiking and exploring and just going out and seeing what there was to see, in the area.
o@	And, * slash error No, / * slash error
sd^e	we never did that.
sd	personally, when we were growing up and when we were going camping, I thought that was a little too structured of a camp ground.
sd	you know, that was mainly for people in motor homes or had trailers and so on and so forth, where, you know, we really wanted to go camping in a tent
sd	and, K O A is geared for the people that have a hookup.
sd	and we camped in the snow, and in, snow caves,
qy^g	And you got a lot of that in, huh?
qw	What do you like to do when you go camping?
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	Enjoy it, huh .
bf	Tell scary, or scary stories around the fire
sd	but I've found out that actually we really enjoy getting away from the television, the telephone
sd	getting out and enjoying nature and each other as company when we're out camping.
aa	Yeah
b^m	Running water
^2	and a private bathroom.
aa	Yes .
sd	I want a Rolls Royce and a Cadillac .
sd	I like to work on cars too.
ba	that's good.
sd(^q)	they didn't necessarily say buy it new they just said, what would you buy, you know.
sv	a restored, vehicle is great, I think, certainly if it's an old Mercedes will be good.
ba	Well, that's great.
sv	you all, done a lot more,
sd	when I talk about working on cars I sure don't do that.
bk	okay.
ba	that is good, acknowledgeable people.
ba	That's amazing.
sd	so, I have Chevies, mostly,
sd	well, that's all I've got right now
sd	I'm, a Chevy, I'm an American car person,
sd	but I do like Mercedes.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I'm not a Ford person and never have been as a kid,
sd	I went to the auto show with my daughter recently, down in Dallas
sd	and, to me the American cars are far superior to the Japanese in styling, engines, right now, I mean,
sd	I'm not saying that they were, a couple of years ago.
ba	yeah.
sd	but I would like to, put it in that category, by a Cadillac
sd	but I wouldn't, buy a new one
sd	and, you know, of course, if I had the money I'd be happy to by a new one,
sd	but, I do look for a one year old vehicle, with twenty some odd miles or whatever twenty thousand miles, whatever.
sd	I remember those.
sv	That she may want to save, if she doesn't have it anymore.
sv	since they don't make them anymore, that could be turned into a classic, in ten, fifteen years,
b^r	yeah.
sd	I'm still a full size person,
sv	but they're, certainly not,
sv	and, and they'll eventually phase them out
sd	and I sure would like one ever those, within the next five years, or so.
b	Right.
sd	Well, even the Japanese cars are bigger too
sd	I've never had a Jap ,
sd	I've had friends who had them,
sv	you can't tell one Japanese car from the other, because they all a like,
sd	I mean, they really all look a like,
sd	I don't have any idea which car it is, until I look at it to see what it is,
sd	they do have sports cars
sd	you can get a Cadillac for, the same price as you can get a small Japanese, car,
sv	it's ridiculous now.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but they were, just styled so differently,
sd	but they really looked beautiful.
sd^e	they have convertibles now in the Cadillac, field
sd	it's not the big, Fleetwood, the one I want, which is been the same in the last twenty years,
sd	the Seville is totally different,
sd	now at the auto show they had fantastic looking cars.
sd^e	it was a month or so ago.
sd	Well, they have it every year.
sd	and, they had all the cars
sd	they had Japanese and German cars,
sd	they had, a new Chevy Suburban, truck, you know,
sd	they didn't have a price on it, nor did they know had a it would cost,
sd	it had a microwave in it and everything,
sd	they had several futuristic cars.
b	Yeah.
sd	they had a lot of not broken down, I mean, you know, cut, displayed engines, you know.
aa	Yeah,
sd	but again yeah, the American cars were for superior in styling and, new engines,
sv	and, I thing so, because they've been making these four cylinder and six cylinder engines for a while / * spelling "think"?
sd	and, I think that, I would definitely buy,
sd(^q)	again there's the question are we in the market,
sd	and I could buy anything, you know.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	Well, I haven't work on them myself so you know, my cars don't go to the shop, you know,
sd	and, I've got three of them
sd	I think I had one someone welded a muffler on for me, in a years time,
sd	like I said I don't do that you know.
b	Yeah.
sd	but I worked my way through college as a mechanic
sd	I learned early from, fifteen on, and dropped it for a long time when, when after I got out of college and, then picked it up again later on
sd	and I never get in them and just go to the shop at you will, you know.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm keeping V eight Chevy engines, because that's what I know,
sd	if you, brought your Chevy to me I'd probably have some parts, for it right now, you knows .
ba	that's great,
sd	I've always wanted to that too.
sd^t	So, child care, your views.
qw	And what religious faith?
ba	 that's good.
qy^g	they do seem to be at the outside edge of both extremes don't they?
sv	And, whenever they are they seem to regulate the good toward the bad instead of bad toward the good.
^2	Better situations.
qy	so, have you ever used outside child care?
^2	Real day care.
sd	our step daughter's ten now
sd	and most of the day care has been provide for by Grandma.
sd	But, quite honestly what I believe to be the best day care situation was while we lived up, the Pass of Woodland Park there was, ex school teacher that, did a small amount of before school and after school, you know, kindergartners, or half dayers in her home
sd	and they would read and play,
sd	and, despite our beliefs, she was, one of the more, Charismatic Christian faiths
sd	and it worked out wonderfully.
sd	but I don't know that it would be state approved.
sd	but I do know that the license doesn't seem to, guarantee quality.
sd	now here I believe that child care meets, by in large, certain standards for, balanced food, if they provide food, cleanliness, and levels of supervision levels being defined as number of working adults for number of children
o@	but, * I'd definitely call this an incomplete slash unit. Yeah, / * See note on A.49 above
sd	and I'm, a backsliding Presbyterian
sd	and, I really believe that this Charismatic care, or the Charismatic belief when emphasized on care, or semi Charismatic I might say was quite good.
aa	very
sv	and, the care is what I guess you should emphasize in the term child care instead of the child.
^2	And not have any care.
qy	Do you know had a I'm saying?
bf	Proper interface.
sd	It's just correctness of social skills, if you will.
sv	it's a very broad issue.
sd	the owner of the chi , of a, you know, a large child care facility now,
sd	we're not talking somebody that does six kids, in their home or three or whatever.
aa	Right.
sd	Their employees earn almost nothing.
qy	do you and your husband both work.
ba	Well, that's wonderful if you can make it that way.
sv	Well, like I said, that's grand if you can pull it off
qy	So, do you have any credit cards?
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I have one card.
sd	but right now, it's maxed out .
b	Uh huh.
sd	the thing that bothers me worse than the credit cards, I think, is, you mentioned the gasoline credit card.
sd	but I've got, you know, one of the, the instant teller cards that you can use for point of sale purchases.
sd	and it's just it's really amazing how quickly that goes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	that's what they've talked about it.
sd	Course it eliminates any waiting period.
sd	God help those people who have to float checks occasionally because you won't be able to with that.
nn	No.
sd	they consider it to be the same as cash well, cause it actually is.
sv	It's better than cash .
sd	it just goes straight in there.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh
sd	but I'm so glad he told me that they, they got to such a point with their credit cards they didn't want to cut them up because they were afraid sometime they might actually need them.
sv	I mean, that's funny.
sd	I want to still have just one just in case.
sd	But, I'd sure want to get it paid down and not use it for a while .
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, our limit is, you know, fairly low
sd	and, so that's one thing that's good.
sd^t	I've got another call.
fc	Okay.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	and then I also take the WALL STREET JOURNAL.
sd	I'd rather sleep the extra thirty minutes in the morning.
b	Yeah.
sd	we're never in home in time to really watch the six o'clock news on television,
sd	so we catch the ten o'clock news,
sv	but radio news is rather short.
sd	most of the stations here that are not all news stations you get about five minutes on the hour.
sd	And if you catch the news stations, you don't catch that much in the car.
b	Yeah
sd	I tried the news magazines like TIME, NEWSWEEK, U S NEWS and WORLD REPORT,
sv	or all of a sudden you look and there's three weeks worth laying on the coffee table
sv	and you wind up throwing them out without reading them.
sv	so have to depend,
sv	I guess we're becoming more of a television oriented nation in that I don't think that, my children even read newspapers, other than the T V guide section.
sd	There's is all, strictly television news.
aa	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	it's the same thing with, the news magazines, like TIME and the other magazines.
sv	It's hard to celebrate, to separate the news from the comment, because, in the way it's presented their opinions is print, or presented as being the news.
sv	And so then you have to try and sort out what really is the news.
aa	That's right.
b	Right.
sv	and then they devote, an inordinate amount of time on the news cast to their personal ax to grind.
sv	And, particularly the local television. I know the, the Wednesday's Child bit
sd	I'm not saying that's not important,
sv	but they leave out a real news issue to devote to one of their local pet projects.
b	Yeah,
sd	and I'm reading it in the evening,
sd	I'm about a day behind most of the time anyway .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	my wife and I feel that we never have a moment that we can call our own.
sd	you don't really have time to sit down and thoroughly read a newspaper.
sd	Didn't find time to even read it.
ad^t	well that's about all then.
fc	Nice talking with you.
fc	Same to you.
qy^t	did you catch your explanation of that?
b	Okay.
qy	You mean the crimes or the punishment should fit the crime?
bk	Okay .
ad	Could you hang on one minute Jim?
fa	I am so sorry to keep you on hold.
qy	Are you at work?
sd	I am too.
sv	it's insane.
sv^r	It's insane.
b	yes.
b	Yes.
sv	It seems like ,
sv	there's too much, underhanded, things going on that the public are not aware of.
sv	The victim has been victimized twice, not only by the perpetrator of the crime but also, the courts that try to do the justice.
sd	I don't have an ounce in my body of credibility toward the judicial system in the United States.
bh	Isn't that terrible?
sv	To get him out of that, criminal mind that he has and to direct, him into a more productive life.
ba	how sad.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Right.
sd	I have found that out. That if enough people respond and rise up against the injustices being done, something is going to change.
sv	People have to be involved.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
aa	That's right.
sv	but our priorities are a bit backward.
aa	That's correct.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	So if the person is not in the right mind, I mean they had to, put her away.
sd	And we just dismissed the case. You know,
sd	and, she was, taken care of by the proper facility.
aa	that's true.
sd	I have mixed views on all three of them.
sv	what, what's, what's certainly drawn everyone's attention to that is the fact that, many of the inner city and, I guess what we'd call, ghetto or poorer districts, including rural districts, don't seem to be able to produce the students that, indeed many, manufacturing and other, enterprises want.
sv	they can't seem to read properly, do math, properly, and conform to what employers want.
sv	and also, I think that, a certain percentage of, the public colleges produce a fairly decent student, or fairly decent graduate, I should say.
sd	I didn't realize it was that high.
sv	well that's what I was going to point out, I think it mostly is that technical,
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah.
sd	I just read an, amazing article, I guess, in this week's NEW YORKER about Baltimore, which, went on to talk about,
sd	I do, I do know a few people and have been, have done some business up in Baltimore,
sd	but it was very difficult.
sd	if I'm looking to carry on a conversation, that way, there's a couple of things that really bother me,
sd	I think when I learned the other day, that, the average American, now, watches seven point two hours of television a day,
sd	Now, I don't know what school children, what year that is.
sv	I mean that's a hell of a lot time to be sitting in front of the tube.
b	Yeah.
bh	Really?
bf	so you're close to the subject.
sd	I have nine grandchildren in various parts of the country,
sd	and, of course, you know, I can't speak to the rural or poorer inner city schools,
sd	they live in a fairly nice upper scale neighborhood,
sd	and they seem to be doing extraordinarily well.
sv	But I, I mean, I think that's part of the environment.
sv	that, that, that could be very well true.
b	Right.
b	Yes.
bh	No kidding.
sd	I guess I can understand that.
sd	However, I'm a product of the New York City public school system from fifty years ago, maybe not that long ago,
sd	and so, I always felt I didn't get a real good education in the grammar schools and part of high school,
sd	and we did it
sd	and I thought a great deal of the success that they had in their education was due to the low student teacher ratio.
sv	And, I, I think that's a formula that could be applied everywhere, except it must cost a heck of a lot of money if you do, it in public school.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, that, that's, that, that must be, then if that's,
sv	I think we both agree on that, then, then, then a parent, parental involvement has to be there.
sv	and it seems to me that money could be more well spent somewhere else.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	but I mean, right.
bf	you say other things than sports, though.
sv	but I mean, they don't just send it to the new stadium,
b	Really.
b	Yeah.
sd^r	Well, I never thought, of that benefit,
sv	but the consequence, then,
sd(^q)	my, I guess what I'd have to say about that, is, there can only be one champion .
qh	Isn't that something, though,
sd	I didn't realize that.
nn	No.
ny	Yeah.
b^r	yeah.
sd	Well, Mark Spitz made a lot of money on it.
sd	but he didn't make it.
b	No.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b^r	right.
b	Right.
sv^t	we're getting off the subject here a bit,
sd	but I do want to add this to that, because I was quite interested in that myself,
sd	and they didn't think they could capture the excitement to get sponsors, if you brought just the f ,
sd	So it had to be, where they could put it in one segment,
sd	and, and I guess, capture the whole thing for some sponsor.
co	Let me ask you another question.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, if you teach college,
sd	and, I know, when I went to college, I went to summer school,
sd	and I did, take those subjects,
sd	my next thought is, I understand there's a lot of talk now about extending the school year which seems inordinately short anyway, compared to the Japanese, or the Germans.
aa	that's right .
fp	Hello.
sv	Well, I think it's a very, very complicated,
sd	Because I, in general, like a smaller rather than a larger population, to the land area.
sd	And, I'm in California, which has a lot of immigration. Probably more than any where else in the country, though I'm not sure if that's the case.
b^r	yeah.
b^r	uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	well, Texas, used to be part of Mexico, or most of it .
b	Huh.
sd	I guess the one thing I do see is that needs to be a solution is, that if you do let people into the country, I do feel you have a certain obligation to, to get them on their feet.
sv	and you're dooming them to being underclass people.
sv	And, of course, there are people in the big cities who would like nothing better than to take advantage of them.
sd	but the funding isn't there for very much work to be going on.
aa	exactly.
sd	I mean, these are people who don't have the foggiest idea about what America's like.
sd	But when they initially come over,
ny	Yeah,
sd	These, are all farmers coming over,
sd	and they're being put in the middle of the city .
sd	they're people who farm on the hillside and then leave the hillside to another hillside and farm on that hillside.
sd	And there was no, real upward movement.
sd	But I didn't, I wasn't a social worker or anything like that.
sd	I do have friends who have tried to do more, social work, you know, by explaining to people how the language, and what the problems learning English might be and such.
sd	And people don't realize how different some of the languages they speak are.
bh	you are?
b	Uh huh,
sd	that's been my impression.
sd	it's not, they're not withholding information,
sd	they just don't have that information.
sd	they haven't the foggiest idea.
sv	And Spanish is, pretty close to English, really.
sv^r	And Spanish is a lot like English.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I'm sure it would.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	I mean, and part of the problem is that, a lot of Chinese and Japanese immigration from, you know, decades ago has been very successful because they valued education and so forth.
sv	And it's really much more complicated.
b^m	the times are different, yeah.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I guess another possible solution is, since taxpayers aren't going to start paying more money for this and, and other budgets aren't going to be cut to pay for it, more of the volunteer network service.
sv	Because everyone gains from it.
sv	and if it's, you know, just people helping people I think makes the community so much happier.
b	Yes.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	but of course, if you're educated and you don't speak English, no one thinks anything of you.
b^r	uh huh.
fc	okay.
sd	it does sound like you have some children to take care of .
fc	bye bye.
sd^e	He doesn't have any children yet though.
sd	but I do have some neighbor kids, lots of little neighbor kids.
sd	You know, it's, because like this one that lives right next door, her mother does some work at home on computers
sd	and it just seems like she doesn't have any time for her. Which is kind of sad, you know.
sv	but, actually I do think that the parents should have, you know, a little bit more time to spend with their kids.
sd	and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about five other kids that she baby sat, you know
sd	So we had a lot of time together that way you know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Because most of them, the father and mother both work, you know.
sd	So you know he's not home very often.
sd	the kids I know miss that.
o	You know.
sd(^q)	I suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because, you know, he is out working trying to make some money for, you know, we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth, you know.
qy	So, are you planning on, having any children
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	That's what my daughter in law told me. That they were going to have kids probably after two years of marriage.
sd	so maybe they just decided that, if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night.
o	You know.
b^r	Right.
b^r	Right.
qrr	or do you work or what?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but, I found it very difficult to find good child care when I was looking for a place to for stay while I thought school,
sd	and that worked.
sd	but when they got older I wanted them to be in a school type situation, I think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and, and be around kids their own age because I think that would prepare them for school also, it's real important , that they do that, that they get that preparation for school,
sd	I wanted them to learn to play I didn't academics forced on them at an early age.
b^m	for the kids.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
ba	Wonderful.
ba	great.
ba	that's, wonderful.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's wonderful.
ba	great,
b	Right.
ba	that's, wonderful too,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's wonderful.
ba	dear.
b	yeah.
sv	you know that's an ideal situation,
sd	but not many people can afford, something like,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
aa	yeah,
sd	but they're are just so many people out there that aren't that, lucky,
sd	because I'm a single parent,
sd	I, still am teacher,
sd	and it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was what I wanted, where I could, have piece of mind when I taught school / * transcriber spelling error "piece" should be "peace"
sd	and I knew my kids were being taken, care of.
sd	and, plus I, wanted them to get something out of it, I just didn't want it to be a day where they went and slept and ate cookies and, that's it .
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Sure.
aa	I agree with that.
sd	Well, the thing is, I teach this grade and I can see very readily the kids that didn't never learn socially how to get along with other, children
sd	and they're the ones that are having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically, because they're should be, there's to many things in their way, / * to should be too
sd	and they did learn to get along with other people.
sv	and I bet if we trace back to their, early childhood we could see some, you know, times they didn't get to play or be with other kids their own age really learn how do get along with, people.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I bet you could too, because you know, kids have to learn how to get along with other people,
sv	and if they don't they just don't turn out to be really, you know, good adults or, successful adults I should say,
sd	and they daily have problems with whoever is taking care of the child,
sd	or they switch a lot, which is not good for the child either.
sv	and it would be ideal like you hope when you have children, your wife gets to stay home,
sd	I would have given anything if I would have been able, to stay home with my children.
aa	Yeah,
b	Right.
ba	great.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's, wonderful.
ba	great.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
bh,sd,o@	don't they though that's what I have right now , * Seems like a slash should be placed after "though" thirteen and a sixteen year old.
sv	they really are expensive,
sd	most of the area where we live in most of the kids have cars.
sd	So, you know, right now I'm looking for a little truck for my for my son,
sd	so I can afford it,
sd	but, you know, I just look forward to him helping me out because I for years just car, drove in carpools all over the place
sd(^q)	and, And it will be nice just to be able to have him say will you go to the store, will you take his sister somewhere, something like that.
aa	That's right.
sd	It, does for ever.
qy^t	You think we've talked a long enough time?
qy^d^t	in ten minutes, you have to talk that long.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
bk	I see.
bk^r	I see.
qw	where are you from?
sd	my gosh, I'm from, Plano, Texas which is outside of Dallas.
sd	because that's where T I is .
sd^t	I guess we're supposed to talk about music.
qy	are you a musician yourself?
b	Uh huh.
qr	do you sing in a choir or a choral group?
qw	What kind of singing do you like to do?
qrr	or have you studied?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
bh	really?
qr	did you do that in, Texas, or somewhere else?
qw	Whereabouts?
sd	and now for about the last eight years I've sung in a church choir here, in Texas.
sd	And, so I enjoy, just the chorals singing a lot, as well.
qr	are you a soprano, alto, or,
qr	Do you have a particular composer that you like or, a particular type ?
qy	have you ever done any, if, if you had done MADAM BUTTERFLY.
b	Yes.
sd	and, it was really wonderful.
sd	and, so, it was quite popular.
qy	so, have you ever wanted to, like guitar or piano or ,
sv	I think piano is always good background,
sd	but neither of them stayed with it .
sd	and the other one the boy is, guitar and percussion,
sv	and, I'm sure that for you, it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself, just for practicing and so on.
qy	Do you have any other kind of music that you like?
sd	it might be rock, you know
sd	it was just, he said that just about what you said, that he just liked all kinds of music.
sd	And that was neat for me to hear that somebody is,
qy	do you have any plans to, do anything with your music in the near future
b	Uh huh.
sv	and, that's often a good way to get back into it again.
sd	and you get to know you know, people socially as well as in a musical setting,
sv	so that's always fun.
sd	and, and I think we sing better because of that.
sd	I think, you know, I think we sing more like, people who trust each other , which is really nice.
qw	So, whereabouts in, Texas are you, if I could ask?
bk	okay.
sd	so, we're just not too far apart, actually.
sd	so I'm always asking where in the state, you know, the person is from if they're in Texas.
qy	do you have a family?
qrr	or you know, if you had, other musical people in your family.
qy^d	if you have other people in your family who are also musical.
qy	were your parents that musical?
sd^t	But, I'll bet we've done at least five minutes.
fc	Well, I've enjoyed talking with you, Becky,
fc	and, maybe we'll talk again.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	and we try to stick to it .
sv	That's the kind of things that throw you off.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b^r	yeah.
sd	and so we pay all of the little bills, one paycheck and then like the mortgage and the electric bill, you know, those big bills the second second pay
sd	and then, again, he does have a savings that comes out, you know, for Christmas and stuff, that kind of thing.
sd	that kind of thing.
sd	But it's nice that it's there, you know.
sd^r	It's nice that it's there.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	That's kind of how I felt when I was working because it seemed like we spent more.
sd	Then a lot of it was going to, daycare and that kind of thing.
sd	and I don't know why
bf	you kind of try and buy bigger quantities.
bf	you could take a little longer. And just watch a little bit more I guess.
sd	It just seems like we save a little bit more whereas, where I was working,
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	It adds up.
sv^r	It is,
b	Uh huh.
sd	and the other one's two and a half,
aa	Yes .
sd	and it does add up.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, that's, that's hard.
sd	But I'm enjoying my stay home for the little time that I can .
sd	and that's what's so sad
qy	do you have any pets?
b	Oh.
b	Oh .
bf	Instead of being carried .
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
sv	They're cute.
b	Uh huh.
sd	She's like fifty five pounds.
qy	Is it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	huh.
sd	Well, she's got a brown nose instead of black too.
sd	Which makes her, I guess, unshowable, even if she had papers which she doesn't
sd	and she was a lot of fun.
b	Oh.
sd	I bet it had a pretty coat too.
o@	Huh uh. * slash error Yeah. / * slash error
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and I wonder since both of them are having them if it's some kind of breeding problem.
nn	Huh uh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sd	we looked at some of the shepherd mixes and the puppies weren't very, social and stuff.
sd	And that, was mine.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Huh.
ba	Wow.
qy	Do you sew at all?
bh	Did you?
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
sv	and the quality is sometimes so poor that, it really is worth while to sew.
aa	Right an,
b	Yeah.
sd	and the patterns have gone up tremendously, too, the prices for them, you used to could get, you know, a pattern for two or three dollars, now, they're like, you know, five, six, seven, eight.
sd^e	I'm not.
sd	the cheapest ones now are like maybe, four or five dollars, six, seven
sd	they get up into twelve and fifteen and, on like that.
sd	I wish that I had started sewing, you know, when they were younger.
sd	and, I didn't like the way it looked so I'd never wear anything.
sd	and, it really makes it look professional
sd	and I've taken some classes here in, Dallas.
b	Yeah.
sv	there's just so many people sewing now days.
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	I'm not that talented.
sd	I have a sister that can, crochet real well, or knit, I guess I mean knit.
sd	And she knits things like hats, and, sweaters, you know .
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my goodness.
sd	now they have the, knitting machines that will do it for you.
qy	Are you familiar with what a Serger is, the Serger Sewing Machine?
sd	and then we'd finish the edges,
sd	and we would, trim the seams and finish the edges.
sd	Well, this machine does it all in one step.
sd	and it cuts off the, you know excess seam allowance.
sv	And, it really makes it look professional.
sd	and it doesn't really,
sv^r	But, the Serger really makes it look professional.
sd	I paid like about eight hundred dollars for mine,
aa	Uh huh.
sd	So, since I bought it and paid that much for it, I guess I'd might as well get some use out of it.
sd	I'm going to have to do it.
na	Right.
b	Yeah.
nn	No.
sd	I play the piano.
bf	you do.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and, I played for the choral club in high school
sv	and, you know, you get rusty.
sd	but I'm rusty now.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	right.
sv	Well, sewing does take an awful lot of time, takes an awful lot of time.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
^2	on the, right on the straight grain, and all that stuff,
sd	that's, that's the part that I don't like, too.
sd	even the cutting I don't like.
sd	it has four threads instead of, the regular basic two threads.
sd^e	you can either use three or four of the threads.
sd	and it's the loopers that form the edge, you know that edge finish.
sd	and, you can use all kinds of different, textures of thread.
sd	you, you need it to do things like button holes, and, seams that need to be done on the sewing machine.
sd	but there are other things that a regular sewing machine does that it doesn't do. Like you can't top stitch with it.
sd	It will also do a rolled edge,
sd	Gee, it's just so versatile,
qw	What part of the country are you in?
ad	Well, we can, complain together or swear we can complain together about the humidity .
ng	I wouldn't think,
sd	Far north Dallas .
sd	about a half a mile from Plano .
sd	So we're in the,
sd^e	it's been very, very rainy, I know.
sd	and when we first lived here, we were in Garland, East Richardson, and, doesn't seem like it was quite as humid.
sd	but, it's a lot colder too.
sd(^q)	so, said, Here, here's a g ,
^q	here we are again.
sd	but, I just don't remember the humidity.
sd	Actually, though, it was a lot rainier here in the winter, we came back last August.
sd	It's just a lot rainier than I remember it, all through the seasons, you know.
sv	I really do think that's part of it.
sv	It's just like down here, when people here think it's a hundred and six, people up north think it's a hundred and sixty down here.
sd	I'm making that up.
sd	You know, when it's only like ninety five.
sv	it's just like up there, when you hear it's forty below, it's probably really only five below.
sd	well, probably what Arizona used to be like, you know, it's just dry and cool,
sv	so it's not what you think it is.
qw	Where did you move here from?
sv	you could talk about that's, that's a strange state for,
bk	there you go, okay.
aa	This is very true.
sd	well actually, the summers up there, we thought, were the most beautiful time of the year.
sd	and that's probably one of the stranger things, when you see the air inversions, and then you go into the mountains
sd	and it just was a very mixed bag in terms of Colorado.
bh	Isn't that strange?
qy	are there tornadoes in Colorado, yes or n , I don't,
b	Yeah.
sd	in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, they've even had, I'm going to say, mini tornadoes for lack of a better word.
sd	That was unheard of, you know, twenty years ago.
sd	so I don't know what's happening, if it's, you know, we are, the greenhouse, I don't really know.
sd	it just seemed a little bit more pleasant in terms of the atmosphere, you know.
fc	You too.
fc	Okay.
sv	Well in Atlanta, Georgia you probably have a lot more crime than we have here in Patterson, California.
sd	this little city is only about eight thousand people.
sd	But like, I lived in Oakland, until just recently
sd	and, Oakland, California, God, they've had like, sixty seven murders so far this year compared to like, forty at this time last year.
sd	So it's really bad there.
sd	and it's all related to drugs it seems like.
qy	Is that what it's there too?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Like I don't know what they can do to make it better unless they just hire more policemen.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	Well I think that if they would do something to these people that they do catch instead of just slapping their little hands
sv	and they would not do these bad things, you know.
sd	Because, you know, like in other countries, man, I mean, they're really a lot stricter than we are.
b^r	uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I know when I lived in Oakland, it was just that, like, I definitely wouldn't go into certain areas of the city by myself.
sd	and then again some areas I wouldn't go by myself after dark you know.
sd	But down here, in Patterson, well like I say, it's so small that you can go anywhere.
sd	But just, like twenty miles away see in Modesto, they have, those gangs and things over there.
sd	In Sacramento also, they have, drive by shootings it seems like all the time.
h	So, I don't know.
sd	I just don't know what they can do you know.
aa	I know.
sd	I know we've had this one lady that was attacked, you know.
sv	I mean, you just, you just don't know what to do anymore, you know.
sd	so it's not always happening at dark.
h	So I don't know.
sd	Carolyn, I have a little miniature Schnauzer.
qw	What do you have?
sd	it's part, Doberman and part Husky .
sd	and being single, she's become very important in my life
sd	it's so nice to come home and find something, or someone who's really so happy to see you.
sd	and I'm not home
sd	and unfortunately she's not as well trained as I would like her to be
sd	I'm not doing a really great job as a disciplinarian,
sd	and, not one mess does she make
sd	I just want to kill her at those times.
sd	she really is.
sd	and then, course, when my children were growing up, we always had a dog, and always said it was because the children wanted the pet
sd	and I find that I'm enjoying this one far more than I ever did when it was the children's dog,
sd	in fact my children gave me this little puppy for Christmas.
sd	I think so .
ba	my goodness.
b	Oh.
sv	that is really probably bad timing.
ba	yes,
sv	when you set a rule you have to stand by it, and be consistent
fp	Amy, how are you doing today?
sd^t	I think we know what we're going to speak about.
qw	How's that?
sv	I personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're talking about criminals, criminal cases that they should bring back hangings on weekends, in public places.
sd	There is one state that does that, by the way.
sd	They don't do them real often. Which is obviously the death penalty.
sv	and let's just screwing up the system.
sv^r	That's pathetic.
aa	This is true,
sd	If it's life and a day, then he's not eligible for parole.
sv	let's quit B S ing with the system.
aa	Exactly.
bf	A life for a life.
sv	I mean the guy just shouldn't be allowed to even live.
sd	about the issue about sentencing by the judge.
sd	he was a veterinarian, and killed two, a father and a son, okay.
sd(^q)	there's a certain percentage of the people there, with seventy percent of the people said, hey, they guys guilty.
aa	Exactly.
bf	because it's not next day they have, the, start the trial, it's X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more.
sv	and let's just get on with the program.
sd	But as far as the sentencing by the judge, I would have to vote against that since there is a jury, because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision.
qo	what are your feelings?
o	Well give me a break, you know.
sv	you'd have to be pretty dense,
sv	you'd either have to be in a cave not to know what's going on, or moving it to Lubbock, or somewhere, possibly is not the answer.
aa	This is true, so true.
bf	So, you're at the house you're not at the plant.
sd	but I wasn't sure.
co	well, I'll let you get,
qr	what are you, in favor or no comment?
qy^d	you are?
sv	Well, this should be very interesting, because I'm against it.
sd	Well, you know, now here's something that, first occurred to me when they started having all these problems with these automatic, weapons.
sd	now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic weapons.
sv	And, yet, the gun control enthusiasts are, preaching about the gun control and how we should have stronger laws and what not.
sd	I don't understand why we don't enforce the laws we have.
sd	this is a federal law, controlled by the Treasury Department. for fully automatic weapons.
sd	And, all right, now for instance, in California where they passed the semiautomatic
qy^d	The military version, attack weapons, or something?
qw	how is that going to affect the, sports weapons? I mean, rifles, that are automatic or semiautomatic?
sd	well, now, I've got to admit I'm inclined to agree with you there even though I am a member of the N R A,
sd	and they, their reason being that well, if you let one little law get through, pretty soon one's going to stack up on top of another, and so forth and so on.
ad	And you've got to admit that Congress does kind of look at things that way.
qy	now did you hear about the control that they have up in Virginia?
sd	Anyone ever convicted of a felony cannot purchase a weapon.
sd	and they don't have a waiting period, because they have access to computer records concerning all these felons.
sd	and you get your gun right then and there.
sd	but they are the only state that does it.
sd	And, according to Virginia, it didn't cost all that much.
sd	and frankly, I don't understand why a state doesn't have those records available anyway.
sd	at least records of, known felons which are available to local police departments.
sd	certainly those records are available,
sv	and all they would have to do is expand it. To, well, connect them into a modem somehow.
sd	and they managed to squeak out a few bucks to do it.
sd	And, it's, one hundred percent successful.
sd	I just heard about this last week.
sd	they were bragging about it,
sv	they should have, have pride in this because it's a good system,
sd	and it's working well.
sd	And they don't need that seven day waiting period.
sd	Because the whole idea of that waiting period was, so that, the police could check up on you.
sv	those files are going to back up on somebody's desk, just some of that typical bureaucratic work.
sd	that's another, thorn in my side, bureaucratics, politicians.
sv	So anyway well, we seem to be one in favor and one against.
sv	Although neither one of us are, really dyed in the wool.
sv	well, there should be some way of checking,
sd	now here in Texas, all you need is a driver's license.
sd	And, even felons can still get a driver's license.
sv	well, they're not rigid enough here, in Texas.
ad	But don't tell the N R A I said that.
sv	They're liable to tear up my membership.
qy	You say you retired a year ago?
sd	I'm looking forward to it in about just over a year, myself.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I bought a motor home here four years ago
sd	and I'm looking forward to just traveling.
sd	I have four sons scattered all over the country, and a few grandchildren.
sd	And I'm looking forward to just traveling around visiting them.
fc	Well Charles, good luck to you on your,
fc^m	nice talking to you, too.
fc^m	Take care now.
b	Uh huh.
qw	In what way are you talking about.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	And I also thought that, that would interfere with college work.
b	Yeah.
aa,o@	That's true. * Should be a slash unit Yeah / * See note above as an indep. slash unit this would be an 'ny'
qw	what year are they looking at?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Right .
b	Yeah.
sd^c	I thought that was your line .
qw	what age group are they looking at?
b^m	Eighteen.
sv	normally that would interfere with college, I would think.
ad^c	Maybe that's part of it.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah
sd	but I do have children to think about, you know.
aa	Right.
b	Yeah.
aa	I do too .
sd	Or he's in the Dallas area.
sd	And, he's very well known around here.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	So, there's a lot of people here pulling for him.
h	So. I don't know .
qy	did you work in the, computer business, is that what you said?
sd	my husband works for, Texas Instruments.
sd^t	And, so, that's how we found out about the Switchboard.
qy	Do you work?
qo	What do you think?
aa	That's right.
sd	Well, I've worked all the time up until just about a year ago.
sd	and I mean, I love my job.
qy^d	I assume so.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Oh.
bf	It's real hard.
sd	I mean even I,
sd	It was so hard for me to work full time.
sd	but then you give up the money.
qy	You know?
b	Yeah.
sd	I know.
sd	Well, I've decided now in fact, I'm substitute teachers aid which is afar cry from my travel agent career, which I loved.
sd	But I'm there in the same school as my children, my two littler ones.
sd	and I'm just really hesitating, because I enjoyed the first summer home ever, like seventeen years with my kids.
sd	and it was wonderful.
sd	My kids and I, we just had a ball.
sd	Of course, their ages, they are almost seventeen well, sixteen, fourteen, eleven, and nine
sd	and we are just running every direction
aa	It is.
aa^r	It is.
b^m	Always worked.
b^m	What, yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	You know, sometimes I'll have the cookies ready when they, come home
sd	I'm very happy to be staying home.
sd	But again I miss, the .
sd	I don't.
o	Right.
bf	If we want, extra clothes, the extra car, the extra,
sd	The thing is, when a woman does work, then there is the clothes to buy,
sd	and then there is the gas,
sd	and then there is the lunches and then the day care.
sd	day care.
b^m	for two.
sv	It's almost hardly worth it for you, to work until they get in school.
qy	Are you a teacher?
b	Uh huh.
b^m	It's not the same.
sv	and it's terrible for divorced women you know, who are forced to work who maybe don't have a college education.
sd(^q)	and I could get a real good paying job, if I wanted to, you know, in fact, I still have offers, you know, please come back,
^q	and we'll pay you this .
sd	My kids, we've seen a remarkable difference in, now that I'm home.
sd	but I've been doing a lot of volunteering at the schools and playing lots of tennis .
aa	I know .
b	Yeah.
qy	do you, think we should go metric?
b	Yeah.
sd	I remember they tried it in the seventies at one point or something
sd	me too.
sv	push, I, it, I bet the push just wasn't big enough.
sv	so, you know, what I think they'd have to do would be to have both things on there for a while, and then start phasing things out
b	Yeah.
sd	I was just thinking, two liter bottles are what you buy and one liter bottles.
sd	You don't buy quarts and gallons anymore of soda.
^q	I went, a hundred kilometers. You know.
sd	I would be total loss.
sv	I think, though, if there were some, you know, sort of government incentive program or something people would begin to switch over, you know,
sv	and, pardon my expression there, but, who would get really, you know, upset and start to complain and get all cranky and stuff.
sv	But I think in the end it would make life a lot easier for people coming up.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, what I think the difference between now and then might be, this is just a might, is we were the first generation that was in elementary school.
sd	you'd have, you know, two or three more generations that all now are familiar with the metric system.
sd	and, I could handle it for a while, and then eventually I'd learn,
sv	and I think that before, it was you know, just a bunch of little kids using it.
sv	and we'll sort of deal with it, I think.
sv	I mean, everything seems to be based on the same thing.
b	Right .
b^m	Centimeters.
sd	But I wonder if,
b	right .
sv	like from now on all licenses would have that, rather than going back and changing everything, you know, all new licenses as of nineteen ninety two would have it or something.
sd(^q)	I know, though, at the amusement parks, they say if you're under forty two, inches or something. You can't walk in here.
sd(^q)	see, what some of them is like, you know, they say if you're not taller than this line.
aa	That's right.
sv	It would be a neat case where like, where kids taught the parents, I think, you know.
no	But I don't know.
b	Oh.
sv	I mean, it seems like like, like, like sort of stupid.
sv	and we're supposed to be, you know,
sv	and now we're backwards.
sv	I, I would think, I mean, a, a base ten system as compared to a base twelve system makes a lot more sense.
^h	let's see,
sd	I just sort of make it up.
sv	those wouldn't be a problem.
sd(^q)	I know things like, you know, a pint is a pound the world around or something.
o	I promise.
sd	we opened a jelly bean business.
sd	we didn't bo , we didn't bother buying a scale.
sd	We'd go out and just buy, you know, five pound bags of sixteen different flavors, put it in plastic shoe boxes and, and then sell them for x amount per pound or quarter pound or something.
sd	and he got the measuring cup and just measured, I think a cup or two cup, whatever is a pint.
sd	If anything, we were actually in favor of the consumer.
sd	but that was our general tendency anyway.
sd	we really didn't, make, you know,
sd	I think we were only making seventy five dollars each profit at the end of the year. You know, after an entire semester,
sd	but we had a hell of a lot of fun doing it.
sd	and we had another friend, the physics major again, he wasn't he wasn't aware of jelly bean physiology, I guess,
sd	and some snow fell into one of the cartons.
sd	And basically what we had, sort of non coated beans at that point.
h	I don't know.
o	Okay .
sd	I know in here, downtown Dallas, I mean you drive by and you can see it.
sd	And, they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner.
sd	And, of course, they don't have that here in Texas
sd^e	not in Te , well not in Dallas, that is.
sd	We're going there tomorrow.
ny	Uh huh
b	Uh huh.
sv	you do then.
qy	Is it really?
sd	I would not imagine that.
b	Huh.
ba	You learn something every day.
sd	I've seen that.
b	Huh.
nn	Huh uh.
nn	No .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	that's true.
^g	Right?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That is good.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh.
b	Oh.
sd	maybe it was C N N where they were demonstrating that. Or something similar to that.
b	Huh.
qy,am,o@	was that something * Seems to be an indep. slash unit maybe it was. / * See note above
h	I don't know.
br,o@	Huh? * Should have a slash Huh. / * See note above
sv	and they're very expensive too. .
aa^r	Yeah.
sv	Because if they want people to convert, you know. They should make it worthwhile.
sd	but some days it's very nice here downtown
qy	Were you there at a?
sd	Cause I haven't been there probably ...
ny	Yeah.
sv	Now then I think that
qy	are you there?
qy	Do you have any one that has been in a nursing home?
b	Yes.
qw	I mean, what can we do,
sd	of course I'm old enough to remember when the family or the church took care of all of this.
ad	no, you tell me how you feel about,
sd	I worked with an agency in West Texas it's where they really started this concept of Meals On Wheels
sv	and I think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly.
sv	If they didn't have to, you know, go into a kitchen
sd	she didn't want to live with either my sister or me
sd	as long as mother was, you know mobile and got her food,
sd	and she was with people with whom she enjoyed.
b	Sure.
ba	Yes, sir.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Being a widow I find that eating alone is one of the hardest things I have to do.
sd	and I am finding it extremely hard to adjust to.
sd	So, mother had the little kitchenette
sd	and she could do all these fine things that she just, had a microwave, had to pop her popcorn.
sd	Now this is wonderful.
sd	But when it came time for a full meal, then mother was able to go with people and enjoy.
aa	I think so.
sd	I'm in favor of it.
sv	but, I still feel that it could be a deterrent to crime. Particularly with the increase of serious crime that's going on now.
b	Okay.
sv	I think,
sv	any crimes against person, I feel, there should be more than a slap on the hand, and being sent to prison and being released in, two or three years.
b	yeah.
sd	I don't see a thing wrong with that.
sd	I think there's, someone that's on trial right now here in the Dallas area,
sd	a young lady was killed sometime back, a young girl. A personal trial and the reporter was asking a stupid question of the people outside. / * Shouldn't the continued statement end after "A personal trial" and a new slash unit begin?
^q	Well, how do you feel about this?
sv	And, you know , how do they feel about it, I'm sure that, they want it over with / * Seems that a slash should be placed after "feel about it"
sv	and they want the person punished and punished, properly.
aa	Yes.
sd	Well, I feel like the cost of someone who's quoting figures made the cost, at like thirty thousand dollars, a year to keep someone in prison.
sv	And, well, the problem there is they're not keeping the right ones in prison in many cases.
sd	There are more, and more instances being on the news,
sd	or this individual was out on the streets, on probation or parole and killed someone else. Or, seriously injured someone.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yes.
b	Yeah.
sv	Here again, anytime anyone goes out with a gun in their hand and crime on their mind the opportunity exists for someone to get killed.
sd	Now I'm not in favor of gun control to the degree or anything because, there are uses for guns which are noncriminal
sv	but it seems that the criminal element are the ones that are using them. aside from domestic disputes, husbands shooting wives or vice versa.
sv	But these individuals, if they have a gun with them, I think that the sentence should be even longer than if they don't.
sd	Well, Well, but here again, if a matter of expediency, part of these costs like the people on Death Row is that their appeals can take years and years.
sd	I know there's a law, I believe, that it's automatic appeal if it's a death sentence.
 sv	Well, I think that automatic appeal ought to take place, within a reasonable length of time, say six months.
sv	And a decision be made and not drag out in the courts for years, because of misplaced commas or whatever technicalities, there might be.
sv	there's got to be a, there's got to be a time limit.
^2	a legit, legitimate appeal, not a technicality, of, if, they're not arguing that the guy or woman committed the crime.
sd(^q)	They're arguing over, well, were his civil rights violated because, someone didn't file the proper paper at the proper time.
sv	Those are the things that have caused them to drag out I think.
b	Yeah.
bf	He didn't see his, lawyer as quickly as he should have, or some, some Mickey Mouse type thing like that.
aa	yes .
aa	Yes.
aa	and I agree.
sd	We practice law ourselves because it's too expensive to hire lawyers, to a degree.
aa	There you go.
sv	Well, it's a case that we have a legal system which the criminals have found a way to use and a way to benefit them rather than the public itself.
sv	So that's how we get caught in this, sort of a catch twenty two.
sv	But you have to continue, to protect the innocent you're giving an open door to the guilty.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yes . It does, most people.
qw	where does she live?
sd	I don't know that.
sd	so our kids probably never went to school together or anything .
sd	well, I've got one in college .
o	By now.
qo	What about you? .
sv	even if people have good intentions, I think power corrupts or something to a certain extent, you know.
sv	and a lot of corners being cut and the special deals available, because they're in on the know , you know .
b	Oh.
o	you know what I mean?
sv	So maybe it's just man's nature .
b	Uh huh.
qw	What were they doing taking some,
ba	no .
ba	gosh.
b	right .
b	Right .
sd	and I mean, that was our biggest scandal for the last few years, I think.
sv	However, the things that have gone on in the last couple of years, we can't afford too many of those, you know, the the HUD mess or the S and L.
sv	We could almost not afford such terrible corruption.
sv	and it kind of makes you feel bad that the top people in your country would be lying to you like that,
b	Right.
sv	They need money so much, because they're constantly having to run, for office again.
^g	don't you?
sd	some of them seemed like kind of, heroic people.
o	Okay.
sd	well, we like a lot of gasoline credit cards, because we like to be able to stop, you know, when we're traveling and stuff wherever there's a station,
qo	What about you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bh	really?
b	Huh.
qy	is it like an automatic debit
b	huh.
bh	really?
sd	and then we just pay it off the next, month.
sd	we don't like to pay interest on the credit cards at all.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and we had to finally mail them another check.
b	Huh.
sd	I don't either.
bf	you figure, you'll get your check back if you have to.
b	Yeah.
sd	I like to use my card if I buy something through the mail which I don't do real often or something from out of state, you know, where if something is wrong, you don't want to end up having to pay for it.
^q	or I don't know what this is.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh .
bf	if you filed that letter with them then they will kind of,
b	Yeah.
sd	I'm like you, too, about the yearly fees.
sd	and since we don't pay the interest it doesn't really matter what the interest rate, is too, just as long as we don't have to pay that yearly fee.
sd	and those got so high we finally decided for him and me both to have a card it was like ninety dollars or something I think,
sd	but we decided let that one go
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	like you said, if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff, it's more worth it.
b	Uh huh.
sv	that wouldn't be too hard to do .
qy	Have you ever run into problems of charging up more than you meant to and having to, be stuck with that?
sd	We've never had, that problem either.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah
sd	I guess it depends on whoever you buy it from how fast they turn them in or something.
sd	I guess they're called those pointed sale terminals where it's like it goes in the minute, you charge it.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
ba	gosh.
ba	that's nice.
b	Right.
sd	and the insur , like if you break it yourself even, you know,
sd	if you buy something that's breakable.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	so, you have children I take it?
qy	You don't?
bf	So, it's not a very valid topic.
ny	yes.
sd	One.
sd	Stepdaughter.
sd	Ten.
qy^d	And, you know how they are at that age, I guess. you having been ten once, yourself.
sd	we have one.
sd	A Keeshonden.
ny	Yeah,
sd	fuzzy little thing.
sd^r	A fuzzy little dog.
sd	he's fun.
sd	Anyway, time we spend with our children.
sv	It seems almost as though children hate it.
sv	Time spent with Mom and Dad is probably one of the worst punishments spent on earth to them.
b	Yeah.
sv	parents are a curse that they just have to live with.
sv	So, it's interesting.
sd	But we do spend time driving in the mountains,
qy	Do you work for T I?
qy^d	You're working then?
sd	With every passing day we wonder if we will be.
sv	it's better to be employed.
sv	Especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner.
sv	And that creates family tensions.
ny	Yes.
sd	I don't have any, children.
sd	but usually, Mom and Dad are a curse.
sv	You know, they'd much rather be with friends,
sv	friends are cool, parents aren't.
sv	well I'm sure part of it is a male, female thing, you know,
sd	I remember whenever I was growing up, often times spent with my Dad was, just wonderful, you know, go, go hunting, or go to the races, or, any number of things.
sd	And we'd have, great times,
sd	and it seems that well now the bank's not available.
sv	and what if's always rough.
sv	and, I don't know, little girls aren't interested in lot of the same things little boys are or were.
^2	Hunting and, Looking for arrowheads, and ...
sv	but they don't like it.
sv	there, there is a difference there.
sv	Well, girls at that age, Video games, boys and malls.
sv	Not necessarily in that order, and friends of course.
sv	And, that's a little tough for fathers.
qh	So, is that quality time?
sd	and we both enjoy that.
ny	yeah .
sd	and, that's somewhat fun.
qw	how would you spend time with kids?
ba	yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd^e	and amazingly a lot of times it's real easy.
sd	You know, a lot of times, whenever we head out of town on a trip or something, it's real easy to swing in there for breakfast.
sd	Breakfast and run.
sv	And breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway,
sv	and, kids eat funny.
sv	And little girls are worse about it than little boys.
aap	or something, yeah.
sv	to some extent the public schools, or the schools in general, influence them, the eating meat kick.
sd	You know, like it's really morally wrong to eat meat or something, I'm not sure.
sd	Of course, that's not the way I was raised, being raised in West Texas.
ny	yeah.
sd	Born in Denton, raised in Lubbock.
sd	So, I understand about bass.
sv	but it is interesting,
sv	Every person out there should have kids, at least once or have some they can borrow for a time, because everyone needs some torture in their lives.
sd	But, Jenny is a sweet kid.
sd	we do do things,
sd	it's almost like a lot of things that were available to us as children, to go do,
sd	The money's not available.
sd	You know , we were talking about how much it cost to go to Disney Land.
sd	three hundred dollars.
sd	You know, for just not in , you know, a day or two, not including lodging and food and all that.
sd	And, I understand Six Flags is real expensive now.
ba	yeah.
b^m	Twenty bucks a whack now.
sd	But, at least once you pay your way in there, at Six Flags ...
sv	So that's not as bad.
sd	You know, Disney World or Disney Land.
sd	Well, our problem is that, you know, a trip to Six Flags or Disney World or, Disney Land, or God forbid, Disney World, would take forever.
sd	Or you'd have to pay air fare,
sv	and, ooh, you know, for a family it gets pretty expensive pretty quick.
sd	Rent a car when you get there and all that.
qw	So, what kind of a house do you live in?
sd	but most of them now are up in the millions of dollars.
ny	yeah,
sd	We have got about, I'd say about twenty four hundred.
sd	we've got five bedrooms, because we built onto our garage.
sd	a bedroom for my mother,
b	Oh.
sd	and that's the thing I probably like the most about it.
sd	It's a Fox and Jacobs home.
sd	we've been real happy with it.
^q	and this is under something
nn	No.
sd^e	we haven't had a lot of problems with it at all.
nn	No.
sd	We've been real lucky.
b	Yeah.
ba	yeah.
sd	but certainly not,
sd	I mean you really couldn't use it for a room.
ny	Yes.
sd	I'll store all our Christmas stuff and whatever else junk up there.
sd	We have a living room and dining room at the front of the house,
sd	and then we have the, family room, kitchen, and playroom at the rear of the house which has been really nice.
sd	but of all the rooms in the house I'd say that was the one that's been really nice to have .
sd	Probably our family room is the biggest.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, that's kind of the way our living room and dining room is,
sd	but it is nice to have it because with our size of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight and clean if you have someone come just on the spur of the moment.
sd	Seventeen years.
b	Uh huh.
ba	wow.
b	uh huh.
sd^e	it is.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's interesting.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, my husband wouldn't do that anyway.
sd	worst thing in life is to have to repair something.
sd^r	he does ,
qo	What do you think about, the way the criminal justice system handles trials?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and that's mostly to decide whether or not the person's actually going to stand trial.
sd	Whether they're acquitted or whether they're actually going to be accused you know, and held over for trial.
sd	I know that judges aren't supposed to be crooked.
sv	if, if the judge is not of high moral standards he could be bought off, much easier than twelve people could.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It's not so much that, I haven't seen a lot of really bad sentences passed either by trials or by judges. What bothers me is that, they really don't mean anything.
sv	and yet, you know, the parole system, it's going to let them out in three years for good behavior.
aa	it's not.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think they're all overcrowded.
qw	Now what are they supposed to do?
sd^r	I mean, they're not allowed to accept any new inmates.
qw^r	So what are they supposed to do with people that they need to put in jail?
sd	and I really like the system of house arrest where a, someone wears a bracelet like a ankle bracelet that's a monitor,
sd	they're instructed, so that, this electronic monitor is turned on at, at a certain time
sd	and it connects them up to a system where they know their whereabouts.
sd	and when the parole officer calls to check on them, they're instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it. So that they can see that this person is actually at home in their house doing what they're supposed to be doing
sv	That allows people, to actually continue to be productive members of society while they're, you know, paying back for whatever crime they've committed.
b^r	yeah.
sd	But, Something that I really don't understand is when someone goes to jail and they have a job in jail and they work, that they should,
sv	I mean they're in jail for crying out loud.
qh	What do they need cigarettes for?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think that's a wonderful idea.
sd	More than that.
sd^r	More than that.
aa	I know.
sd	The thing that, the thing that gets me is that while we're supporting them, they're working.
sd	When they get out of jail they get handed all that money.
sv	I think that while they are in jail and they are working, their wages should go,
sv	some percentage, like eighty five percent of their wages should go toward their room and board figured on a whatever basis how much it costs to actually support them for a year.
sv	And when they get out they should have I don't know, you know, some reasonable amount of money to start, like a couple of thousand dollars,
sv	Anything that they've earned while they're in prison should go back to the State except for that, you know, there needs to be some allowance for when someone gets out that they have some money to start with.
aa	absolutely.
sv	That's the part that I really think we need to change.
aa	right.
aa	Absolutely.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think it works much better if it's the actual jury.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	in some, cases it would work that way.
sv	In some cases it would work the other way.
sv	and, and I think that the jury probably has more of a right to sentence than the judge all the time.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think that's probably a much fairer way.
b	Yeah.
sv	but it would be a more responsible way to deal with it.
qy	Do you work with a company that, gives drug testing ?
bh	they do?
qy	did they do that before you went in or what?
qy^g	they will, huh?
sd	I don't work right now because my company I worked for, P I E, went bankrupt
sd	but, they was getting a program set up, that for all new hires they was going drug, give them drug tests.
sd	But, they didn't hire very many new hires because all the people that usually work there, you know, just stayed there because they had been there for a long, long time.
sv	But, actually, I think they should do it.
sv	You know, I don't think anybody needs anybody to be working for them that's on drugs of any kind you know.
sv(^q)	I think they should kind of warn them, like, you know, well we're going to do that or maybe tell them before they do get hired, you know that this is what is going to happen.
^q	And then if you don't like it, why then, you know, you'll have to go look for a job someplace else.
aa	Well, I suppose you are right there too, you know.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Or what do they do with you guys if, that you guys get,
bk	I, I see.
sv	I think anybody that does them are dumb, you know.
sv	and you just watch it on T V and see how it just burns your brain completely up, you know.
qy^g	really dumb, huh.
t1	But, . Let's see, what else was I going to say here.
sv	I think they all should test really you know.
sv	it just seems like there is so much more of it going on anymore that, I don't know what's wrong with the people,
sv	and and then you know, they'll get out
sv	and they're right back at it again.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	and I'll see what they do, you know.
sd	so they can test me all I want.
qy^d	I wonder if you take medicine if that would effect it.
qy^g	see now that that would be really unfair then, huh?
o	You know.
bf	Find out you know, if you have been taking some kind of medication and, you know, if that would effect it and everything.
sd^t	I think our five minutes is about up anyhow.
fc	and maybe I'll talk to you again.
fc	Alrighty.
qy	do you have a pet Randy?
qr	A poodle, miniature or, full size?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I read somewhere that, the poodles is one of the most intelligent dogs, around.
qw	So, you've only known the dog, how long did you say.
qw	how old is the dog?
bf	it's still just a pup.
sd	I call it a, Chowperd .
sd	So, she's a genuine Chowperd .
sd	but, she has the shape of the, Shepherd.
sd	so she's a medium size.
sd,o@	But she's big enough to be intimidating, * Seems that this should end in a slash since A's next turn is an indep. clause it is a fixed female, by the way, / * see note above
sd	and right from day one, she was teaching me.
sd	Course, I'm a little prejudiced, of course.
sd	And I spread the newspapers out in the kitchen area.
sd	But, next morning, she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom.
sd	and she used them there.
sd	But it wasn't too long until she, found out she could wait until I let her out in the morning.
sd	And since then, I live alone,
sd	and you can see her smiling from ear to ear, she's so happy to see me.
qy^d	And, I don't know if you get that kind of greeting or not.
b	Uh huh.
sd,o@	Well my dog's an outdoor type, she does not like to be indoors. / * 2 slash units?
sd	she'd rather sleep outside on the cold ground at night.
sd	But, I do make her come in.
sd	but during the day I have her on a leash, which is, on sort of a run.
sd	I have a thirty foot cable, running from one stake to another,
sd	and then attached to that is a, twelve foot leash,
sd	so she can cover quite an area.
sd	And, she's the best, burglar alarm going.
sd	it's the strangest thing, though, children, no matter how strange they are, or how new they might be can walk, right up to her,
sd	but adults, if they're strange to her, or they look suspicious or something, boy she acts like she wants to chew their leg off.
sd	And I have not discovered yet where the line is between children and adults.
sd	But, she is a great comfort to me.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
bf	You mean she didn't appreciate all that attention.
qw	What's her name by the way?
qw^r	what do you call the dog?
b^m	Mitzi.
sd	Mine is Gin.
sd	As in, martini.
sd	Actually, it's Gin two.
sd	but then when I went out in the world, I couldn't take her with me.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
by	what a shame.
o	well.
sv	and I must say it was interesting.
sv	I enjoyed talking about pets with you.
fc	Maybe we'll get together again in the future.
fc	Take care now.
qy	Have you done any recently?
b	Uh huh.
qrr	or did you do that yourself?
qy	Did you enjoy that?
sd	We were quite pleased with the result.
ny	yes,
sd	and we had to scrub the crayon marks off, of course, try and get it clean.
br	Pardon me?
sd	and that's, what we put back on there, was a latex paint.
sd	and one of the younger boys, when he was younger, about three years old, got a nice marker and got up on the ceiling and decided to draw pictures .
sd^e	on the ceiling.
sd	but you can't it all off.
sd	And so, that's one of the reasons why we painted,
sd	We used a flat, latex paint
sd	and in the bedroom, as I understand, that's, one of the better type of paints to have because it's not so reflective and glassy colored,
sd	and it, turned out real, real well.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	you had to prime it and and cover over it.
b	Huh.
sd	Well, I like to use this Sears, the ten year guarantee or the fifteen year guarantee.
ny	Yeah.
sd	And the reason being is once I painted, I don't want to have to go and do it another five or seven years later
sd	and, we're quite satisfied with that
sd	you mentioned painting your bathroom.
sd	I read an article recently that, you have to be very careful on the kind of paint you put on the ceiling in your bathroom because it does tend to peel or come off because of the high moisture content in your bathroom.
qy	And, did you have any problems with that
ba	good.
sd	neither have I .
ba	good.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	have you ever used an oil base paint?
qr	but. It adheres better, or lasts longer?
b	Uh huh.
ba^r	that's good.
qy	have you ever done any painting outside?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
bf	That's very spicy, too.
bf	I mean these bell peppers and curry.
sv	that sounds really good.
qy	is this dinner time for you?
sd	so I did cook a little, you know.
sd	and so we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok.
sd	And we do a lot of, stir fry vegetables.
sd	so it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does.
sd	and then after the stir fry is over, just mix in, a little bit of, sometimes chicken broth, and corn starch and soy sauce
sd	and that sort of makes a glaze, that sticks to the vegetables,
sd	we don't put in meat, cause I guess I'm not
sd	so. We'll do, a lot of times vegetarian.
sd	But it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and, carrots and celery and green peppers and, gee, mushrooms.
sd	and we put that over rice.
bf	you don't .
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town.
sd	recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato.
sd^r	Red meat and a potato.
bf	she had all of those types of vegetables.
sd	See, no vegetables in my family.
sd	it was really funny.
bf	Well that was a real farm.
sd^r	I've heard stories.
ad	you shouldn't be talking about this while you're fixing dinner.
sd	we bought everything in a grocery store.
sd	but when we got married, you know, a lot more vegetables, you know, a lot of changes.
aa	I think so too,
sd^r	and we came back with sweets.
sd	We didn't bring all the healthy food back too.
sd	well that's supposed to be, the trend of the future, but, the cut back.
sd	and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots.
^q	Indian candy is not very good.
sd	Everything had a little bit of curry in it.
sd	It was funny, even the sweets did.
sd	You know, it had that after taste that, it was a very Indian flavor.
sd	they were very, yogurt and carrots and pistachio nuts and yogurt.
sd	And it wasn't very good.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I think we're,
sd(^q)^t	and they say you've overextended your conversation.
sd(^q)^t	and it'll say you've over extended your conversation, you now have fifteen seconds to complete it.
sd^t	But, I've been cut off twice.
sd	he has one of those alarms on his car,
sd	and it's going off.
sd	So, I was going to go out and see what they were doing.
ft	hey thanks so much.
sv^t	well you'll get a couple more probably.
sd^t	and she was home with two kids.
sd	it was pretty funny.
b	Okay.
fc	I'll talk to you later.
bf	Okay, you say you're going to buy a new car.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	but, so I guess when we do buy another car it'll be something that we can, kind of grow into a little bit.
sd	it's tough on trips because, anytime we're getting ready to go anywhere you know, it's, like trying to put a puzzle together to make sure you get everything in the car, you know, cause it's,
b	Uh huh.
sd	but . You know, I'd like to do that.
sv(^q)	but, you know, the rest of the time you wonder, you know, could I use something else.
sd	if we can hold out til then, you know, I may get to where I need a something else, maybe buy a van, because they are, really, really nice for long trips especially.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	Well, my wife's car is probably around five years old now,
sd	but, you know, it's getting to the point where we really need to do something with it, you know, if we're going to get anything out of selling it.
sd	We've got other bills that kind of precede, or preclude us buying, something, buying something else.
sd	It just, will wipe you out every month,
sd	it's almost getting to be like the house payment, you know.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	I didn't know that.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh,
b	Right.
sd	and even on the road she does all right for a little while because she'll sleep some,
sd	and it was when all that bad weather was hitting,
sd	and, and we got out and played in the snow and put here back in / * typo > her
sd	and she was fine,
sd	but, you know, if there was something to where she could kind of get up and move around, like you say on the highway, or where, where it wasn't, wasn't as bad, you know, just for a little brief period of time, it would be okay,
sd	so, I'm thinking maybe we can do something like that later on.
sd	we'll see what we can do.
b	Yeah.
fc	I ho , hope everything works out.
b	Right .
o	All right.
b	Uh huh.
ba	How fine.
ba	boy.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really.
ba	Wow.
sd	So we're just learning the ropes here
sd	our backyard has so many tall trees in it that there wasn't even a blade of grass in the backyard.
sd	It just happened automatically.
sd	we planted some fescue last, fall
sd	it doesn't look like it can withstand too much, you know.
sd	and, So, but we don't,
sd	like I say, there really wasn't even one blade of grass in the backyard.
sd(^q)	And, so mostly, you know, we're not even to the point where we're getting into flowers, and flower beds or even gardens, that, we're just saying, let's get some grass .
^q	Let's get grass so that the kids can play in the yard and not have to be worried about the dirt so much. You know.
ba	yeah.
ba	no.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	there was no such thing as watering your lawns in Missouri.
sd	It just happened.
sd	we live in north of Dallas.
sd	Plano.
sd	And so there's a lot of market up here since it's kind of the area that people are moving into in the Dallas area and big market for yard work.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I noticed that they're really putting in small back yards, because most of the houses have the alleys that run behind,
sd	so we're just still at the point where we're talking about the necessity.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Hm.
b	Uh huh.
b^m	Grass,
^2	Or what it was.
sd	and there must be ten or twelve big tall trees out there so that like even if its raining, you can go out in our back yard and not get wet .
sd	and that's what they say the payoff is
aa	yes.
sd	Well, there are all different kinds.
o	Okay.
sd	but I've heard that it's real good.
b	Oh .
b	Yeah.
b	Oh .
sd	Well, last week, as a matter of fact, my children was on Spring Break
sd	We went to see AWAKENINGS with Robin Williams.
sd	And we went to see KINDERGARTEN COP.
sv	and it would be to anyone because, you know, they really don't know that much about it.
aa^r	yeah.
sd	and they started having real bad side effects.
sd	but in time, you know, all the side effects started showing.
sd	Bad.
sd	They actually went back like they were, you know,
o	You know.
sd	it was,
b	Yeah.
qy	as a matter of fact, Sylvester Stallone, is that his name?
sd	It was really good.
sd	I've seen that.
aa^r	yes.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	that's just something I just don't want to watch.
b	Oh.
ba	my goodness.
b	Oh.
sd	I guess I'm a little too scary for that.
b	uh huh.
b	Yes.
aa	yes.
ba	goodness.
aa	Yes.
^q	Mama, I hear it,
^q	Mama, I've seen it .
b	uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
^g	isn't it?
fc	Well, well I've enjoyed talking to you.
sd^t	You know, from where I'm at. We couldn't call in.
sd^t	So I missed several days, because I was getting quite a few calls.
b	oh.
b	Yes.
sd^t	and he's at work,
o	believe me.
fc	and we'll talk to you later.
na	definitely .
sd	and New York had a state lottery,
sd	And it was really a great relief when I got to Texas that I didn't have to pay that city income tax, though.
b	Right.
aa^m	It sure does make a difference.
qy	Do you live in Dallas?
bh	you do?
sd	I do too.
sd	and then, you know too, that, taxes are less, like if you live in Mesquite.
sd	You know, some people will go shopping in Mesquite at the malls out there,
b	Uh huh.
qy	is it, less in Collin County than it is in Dallas County?
sd	and you can't do that anymore.
sd	And I had a little, little, coupon special that was twenty two dollars for, air conditioning service where they, checked it and recharged it and put one pound of freon in
sd,o@	And I couldn't believe it and the tax, you know, really hits you. * both kinds of slash error; Should be 2 slash units, I think Uh huh.
o@	And then, * slash error I've been here for nine years. / * slash error
qw	Really, where did you come from?
bk	uh huh.
sd	My sister used to live there.
b	Uh huh.
o@	That's true, I tell you what hit me the first year I was here, Christmas eve in New York there used to be stores open, the department stores wouldn't close, * There seem to be several slash units in this turn that were not parsed that way well I'd say they closed maybe eight or nine o'clock, department stores, on Christmas eve.
sd	but it was Christmas eve.
sd	and I couldn't find hardly anything open, after five o'clock in the afternoon.
sd	And then another shock I had well, when I went to, to buy a slice of pizza , and found out that I had to buy the whole pie.
sd	back then they didn't.
sd	When I first came, no.
b	Right.
ad	and talking about alcohol and beer, look at the taxes on that, and the taxes on a package of cigarettes.
sd	I used to smoke, you know
sd	but I gave them up a couple years ago because I had some sinus problems.
sd	a little bit more in some places.
o@	well, I believe it's a little more than twelve dollars for a carton, * slash error I think it's maybe thirteen or something.
sd	and they really thought they were getting a big discount.
na	Well because, it's, you know, the Indians, I don't think they pay tax.
sd	in Oklahoma.
sd	And, it was a Indian, well it's a bingo hall for the benefit of the Indians there.
sd	There were just bus loads of people that come from everywhere else to play that bingo because it's, the stakes are higher and payoffs are bigger and so forth.
sd	I won a dollar .
ad^c	Can you speak up, please.
b	Yes.
sd	But they will accept you later in life also.
sd^e	after your children are grown.
b	Yes.
nn	No.
sd	there was a retired plumber that went to, Uruguay I think and helped them quite a bit with concepts in plumbing, you know, providing for better public hygiene.
qy	but, so, do you think that people should be required to give a couple years for the good of the country?
qw	Why?
qy	but if it were told to us that we would find the time somewhere between our seventeenth and, twenty sixth birthday to give a year or two to the, to the country in the form of maybe building better roads or the parks service or the Peace Corps or you know, the military service or something. Wouldn't we have, maybe a better class of Americans?
sv	and that's themselves.
sv	And at least if you legislated, giving for a couple years of their lives or, honestly purely giving but some sort of equitable exchange, then at least the country would have gotten two years from them where, they would have given something to the country instead of taking away all their lives.
bf,nn,o@	give them your entire life for two years, no. / * I think this really should be 2 slash units, with the respective labels.
sv	it's not top wages,
sd	but it does pay.
sd	it doesn't pay well.
qy^d	You're aware of that I'm sure.
^2	And Texas Instruments.
sd	You know , in another time we had the W P A, Works Progress Administration, during the great depression, though I can't see why it was great.
sd	that gave people pay that was halfway between relief which was welfare, and the minimum wage.
^2	In trade for, money, and living.
sd	Public roads that were worked on by the W P A, dams that were built by the W P A, scenic overlooks, parks,
sv^r	our national road system of highways, and roads, is falling apart.
bf	there's a lot of work to be done.
sd	what I'm saying is that if it were mandatory, that every person, right after graduation from high school, that were able bodied, would well, or, not give a year but trade a year,
sv	at least one not more than say three or four, then it would definitely effect unemployment.
sd	Well, you know, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, huge numbers of other western states, have no real welfare system.
sd	but there's no real welfare system.
sv	You know, we have had some problem with that in recent years.
bf	they wish only for the paycheck.
bf	be it selling drugs or whatever.
sd	I enjoy working.
sd	number one, I am one hundred percent for total gun control.
sv	and I really feel that we have to do something in order to ,
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	there's only one problem I have with the whole thing though, is, you know, when they do it, I think our biggest problem is, yes, the crooks and what have you are going to get weapons if the weapons are available.
sd	I mean there is no,
sv	there is, There is no reason for it. I mean,
sd(^q)@	And, you know, when people say, you know, well, my God, they're cutting into my civil liberties and all this, no, I, I take a different stand that as long as they are available and they are so readily accessed out there, then something is taken away from my civil liberties. / * separated into an additional slash unit before no,?
sv	and we've got to reduce the number of weapons that are out in the in the public.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	you know, and, again, my entire family they are all hunters
sd	and I I have no, I really have no problem with sports hunters.
sv	they seem to be losing their common sense over the issue.
sv	I think something will happen.
qy	do you get together with family reunions
sv	that will be fun if you have not done it in a while.
qw	where is your family from?
bh	Is it?
qy^d	So you are going to have to go there?
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
sd	Most of them is down there.
sd	I have got an uncle in Louisiana and another sister here in Texas.
sd	It was every summer we got together.
sd	Now, my grandmother just passed away this last year.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well it, It sure does.
sd	We just did it you know, by word of mouth.
sd	You know. And, my uncle in Louisiana, he is the only one that, you know, had to travel.
sd	and we are just scattered all over the place.
sd	But we have got a huge family.
sv	Because it is so fun.
sd	I mean, my mother has got like thirteen brothers and sisters .
sd	And every one of them have five or six kids. And most of them, you know, have got kids .
sd	It is,
sd	we had two baseball bleachers full of people,
sd	and there are still about eight or ten people taking pictures.
sd	the last time we had one it was so fun.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I, we have always had ours in a park or something.
sd	Only thing is, it is big,
sd	and it is open.
b	Uh huh.
qy	In Missouri?
sd	Well, that was part of the problem with the ones we have.
sd	We was like eight and ten years old.
sd	It was part of the sewage cleaning system.
sd	I have got a four year old.
sd	But if we could have gotten it by a lake or something, I thought that would have been much better.
b	Yeah.
sd	I am sorry, there was, I remember now, there was like, a baby pool, just about a foot deep.
sd	We were all kids anyway .
sd	but I love it, all the different foods, because that,
qw	So, how long did you say it has been since you all had one?
sd	so I guess it has been seven years since we have had one.
sd	And since then we have lost, well, just our grandmother.
sv	That is surprising.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It has been like four years since I have been home.
b	Yeah.
sd	but I won't do it with the babies.
sd	Because, I have got, a four month old and a four year old.
sd	And I just quit too .
sd	I won't be adding any more to the family reunion .
sd	They are good kids though.
fc	Anyways, I have enjoyed talking to you.
fc	All right.
fc	All right, you too.
o	Okay.
fp	Hi.
o	Period.
b	Uh huh.
o	thank you .
sv	Our system shouldn't be based on owing and borrowing and all that.
sv	And if you want a nicer car than that, well, you save a little longer.
b	Uh huh.
sd	both of us had twenty thousand dollars in loans, for student loans
sd	And they pay cash for everything they buy.
sv	and we don't want to cut back our services from the government, because we're spoiled.
qw	What?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	You don't even know it's a holiday .
qy	But isn't it in the federal budget?
qy^d	it's not part of our taxes?
qy	It's not?
b^m	That's why it keeps going up,
sv	Those stamps are valuable, now.
sv	And I don't think Americans are willing to do it.
sv	I mean, it doesn't work, I mean.
qy	Do you understand?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	My opinion's the latter.
qw	or I mean, what do you think long term?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know.
bf	Different ethnic groups .
sd*	I know what your saying. / * typo your > you're
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	which ones have you seen lately?
sd	THELMA AND LOUISE,
qy	Is it good?
bh	Is it?
qw	which Billy Crystal movie?
^2	CITY SLICKERS,
sv	That's a real good show.
sv	but it says a lot about middle life you know,
sv	and, it's a really good show.
b	Yeah.
qy	Have you seen that?
sv	It's a really good show.
sd	has Jeff Bridges and, Robin Williams.
sv	really, really good.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but, I really enjoy watching a movie where they don't really try and attract you know, the great audience, but rather put out a real good movie.
qy	Did you ever see that?
sd	I think it's put out by Landmark Productions, the same people who put out CHARIOTS OF FIRE.
sd	and, it's about, Jesuit community at the Inca Falls in, South America, Northern Argentina.
sd	really, really good show.
sv	The cinematography is just beautiful and really beautiful scenes and real good music.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
bh	yeah?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, it gets very difficult to,
aa^r	yeah.
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
sv	Sometimes you're in the mood for it even.
sv	But it's fun to,
bf	that's, The ones where they dub in the English.
qy	are you, fluent in another language
bh	you don't?
sd	but I do enjoy watching you know, subtitles.
sd^t	we are to discuss air pollution and, what we think the causes are.
sd	And I probably would, target, industry as being number one polluter.
aa	yes.
sd	because, there's a lot of commercial vehicles out there, especially the big rigs like the busses and, the big, eighteen wheelers and so forth.
sv	and they haven't released it yet.
sv	I think there's a lot of hold back, because, of, priorities that they have, you know,
sd	You have some children.
qrr	or do you,
qy	is there anything,
sv	Well, temporarily they do.
sv	Then we get out of that phase, soon enough.
sd	yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	sure.
sd	and the fumes from the incineration was a terrible pollutant to the air.
sv	and it's not gone either, because it has untold ramifications.
sv	And, And it gets into people, you know, which is, the most important, resource that we have is people,
sv	they, really are.
h	So they say .
sv	but there's not enough.
sv	And we need expert cooperation.
sv	Education of the, Education of the people is primary, I would think.
sv	and we're hard to teach.
sv^r	We are hard to teach.
b	Uh huh.
sv	of course, we would like to see it accelerated because, of the critical nature of it.
sv	just to, think that way, we have to be in that thought pattern and able to, motivate ourselves to, do what is right for the atmosphere.
sv	I mean, every human being that lives is a contributor, to pollution,
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, hopefully it can be resolved within a shorter time frame than we have seen it done in the past. That the time frame for cleaning up our air and our, land, you know, which, we get our nutrients from.
sv	You know, I mean, everything goes back to the land.
sv	So it's just, very critical, I think at this point to, get that through to the people and get us educated.
sd	I don't know if they offer classes in the grade school, subjecting.
bk	okay.
qy	Would that be, perhaps, the first grade level, which would be,
sv	and they can really , relate to that.
br^m	Target stores?
bk	okay.
b	Okay.
^2	help fight the pollution.
sv	and others will pick up on their example and carry it, further.
sv	You know, because, thoughts are,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I was just looking around my house and thinking about the painting that I've done.
sd	it was kind of an orangish brown.
sd	It was not real pretty.
sd	Anyway, so the kitchen was one of the rooms that got hit with that color.
sd	and if I look underneath my cabinets, I'm not satisfied with the jobs I did on it because there're splotches.
sd	But, I'm glad it's done, because it's brighter.
ba	lord.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
qw	So what are you going to get it off with if you get it on and it's dried?
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	And it's not scratching your floor, because it's so thick.
sd	We have two children.
sd	it's just terrible what they do.
sd	So I've got dye on my bathroom door.
sd	I guess I'll have to take that door down and really get it good.
sd	And then we have a two story.
sd	We did the outside of it one summer.
sd	I could get up on the roof and do that.
sd	But, I dread that the next time.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Have you guys tackled your ceilings yet?
sd	We're dreading it.
sd	It's like, they're dark.
sd	Everything else is white.
qy	Now have you thought about this? That wherever you buy your paint, you need to make sure that that store's not likely to go out of business.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but I still feel good, the minute I put that paint on, even if it does got a dent in it
sd	I do.
qy	Do you do that?
qy^d	Spots in it.
qy	Are you having to repair the walls at all?
ba	that's smart.
qw	So where do you live?
sd	I'm in Garland.
qy^t	did you keep getting that it was down?
bh	You didn't?
sd	well, I've never tried any other kinds of painting besides on a surface like the house like to paint a picture or anything.
sd	I can't think of anything else to say about painting.
sv	and it hurts your arm.
b	Yeah.
^g	right?
qy	Do you have one of those straightedge things to put underneath when you're doing the baseboards?
qy	On your baseboards?
qy^d	You don't have any carpet down in your house?
sd	and, I haven't figured out how you're supposed to paint it, on down, so that you won't see where you stopped off and still not get it on the carpet.
sd	You can't hold it there until it's dried.
sv	I think we're overtaxed to the hilt.
sd	but eventually they may try to push it through.
sd	no state income tax.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah.
sv	Well we're really overburdened from federal, state and local, that it takes such a size out of your paycheck that there's not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well they're kind of put into a trap of being out there to please the special interest groups as well.
sv	And, I think the only way that can be changed for us to get a better tax revenue that's fairness and all, is for us to limit their terms.
sv	And by doing so, they're not obligated to anybody.
sv	but, what in general though that taxes are doing to us is, it's just taking, a bite out of our savings.
b	Yeah.
sv	And I believe the Social Security tax is a great scheme.
sv	right now, they're robbing from it to pad the federal deficit.
sv	If, most company, C E O s were to do that within their private company, they'd be in jail.
qh	So how are we letting them get away with it.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	A lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and feel absolutely helpless to oppose a lot of the situations going on, in the taxing system.
b	Yeah.
b	uh huh.
sv	It's just going to take, really, a combination effort, I think, of the majority of the American people to come to a decisive answer, or vote to limit the way it's spent.
sd	See, we're, we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place.
sv	and they are controlled, or pretty much do what they want to do.
sv	or, it's occurred so many times that they figure people will usually forget and don't think about it when the election time arises.
sv	And generally it does work out that way.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well when you get out into the real world then you'll know.
b	Yeah.
qy	you have a bonus?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
^g	right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but then you're paying really high taxes when you're doing a lucrative job.
b	Uh huh.
sd^t	Well, I have, about said all I can think of to say.
sv^t	it's a rather touchy topic at that,
ba	Well that's great.
fc	You too,
fc	have a good day.
qy	do you work outside the home?
ba	wow .
qy	Have you?
ny	uh huh.
ny	well, yes I do.
qy^d	I'm assuming that you are married and have a husband that supports you.
ad	And so we could talk about, that path, you know, how important you think his benefits are. and, and, how important you think they are and what would you like to see increased in his benefits.
sd	How important you think that would be.
bf	Because of course, if you did not have them, you would be pulling from your salary, of course.
aa	Right,
aa^r	right.
bf	And they always have surprises for you.
b^m	With children,
sd	we could not do without the benefit package from any company that we worked whether they be a conglomerate or just a small, business.
^2	You would still have something.
aa	Right.
sd	and that's one of the areas that she is working on. To have, a day care center for the children of the nurses that are staffing the facility.
sv	And that is true in many, many areas of, you know, job titles and professions.
bf	it would, It would be just futile.
bf	And they would not have the quality,
bf	And they, would be deprived of their mother.
ba	I understand that totally .
aa	that's true.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you think that would be, acceptable?
aa	I do too.
aa	That's right.
aa	I, agree with that.
sv	That would be fair.
b	Yeah.
qo	and how do you feel about, let's see, eye care?
sd	Vision, I guess it's called, vision care.
arp	It depends on who examines your eyes.
sv	If you have an optometrist or an ophthalmologist, there's a vast difference in those two, professionals.
^2	Glaucoma.
bk	okay,
b	Yes.
aa	they are.
b	Uh huh.
bf	that's critical, because she's in need of it so often.
sv^r	and, you know, people have needs in their life that unique to us, to them.
sv	I mean, we are all different
sd^e	that's my other phone.
sd	and she's on vacation,
sd	so, it's okay.
sv	That's very expensive.
sv	Orthodontic work is terribly expensive.
sv	Especially when you have a lot of problems with the children teeth, and you have to really get them when they are young, in order to have, not, a decent smile when they are fifteen, sixteen years old.
sd	and they started having extractions at age eight, because they just had too many teeth for their size mouth.
sd	And we footed the bill, because there was not any such thing when they were young.
b	uh huh.
^2	major.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I tell you I just read an article in the paper about what they are doing, I think it was an ad in our publication at Texas Instruments, where they are breaking the jaw and, and lining the jaw up with the teeth.
sd	it's less painful and less expensive.
ny	Yeah.
sd	but it's, it's, easier on the patient in the long run, which amazed me.
qo	So, Beverly, what do you think about drug testing?
sd	we got a lot of mistakes here, in the Maryland, Baltimore area because of, train conductors on drugs.
sd	I guess he smoked marijuana for lunch and, drove his truck up the back of two small cars in a tunnel that goes underneath a river that leads into the Chesapeake Bay
qh	but then you know, who would test all truck drivers you know,
sv	I think, looking at athletes being drug tested
sd	I think the random drug testing, I don't know in my own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs, because they're still being caught
qy	that make sense?
sv	I, I think, in the long run I think it would be good.
sv	I think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have gotten away with it you know, the test hasn't come down hard on anyone
h	I don't know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah,
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I guess, my dad was hit by a drunk driver who was also high when I was probably eighteen, my senior year in high school
sd	and I could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him
sd	and from from that point on, I became so anti drunk driving now I think people should be allowed to drink, I think that's an adult responsibility, whatever,
sv	and drugs have, long lasting effects
sd	and I guess when I younger I was, probably a little more liberal on the subject.
sd	I guess when I was eighteen years old, if you'd have asked me, I'd have thought it was fine
sd	but by the time I was nineteen my opinion had totally changed.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	Traction and all that terrible stuff.
b	Right.
sv	I don't think somebody,
sv	you don't, you don't have the right to interfere in somebody else's life.
sv^r	You don't have the right to interfere in somebody's life.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd^t	This is a subject that I'm not real well versed on,
aa	Okay.
o	No.
sd	I'm in Richardson.
qo	What do you think as far as air pollution in the Dallas area?
b	Right.
b	Right.
bh	really?
b	Sure.
sv	Well, you are well versed on the subject, I tell you.
sd	I guess I notice it the most just, in driving around Dallas with all the highway equipment that's working on the on, six thirty five and seventy five, just the cars in general.
sd	That's where I see most of it.
b	Right.
sv	and I think they'll be working on them long after my wife and I are gone.
b	Right .
sd	and, I guess when you're out on the interstate, heading north or south and you're just cruising right along and there's no build up of cars
ny	Yes.
co	and I'm going to make it a point to.
b	Sure.
sd,o@	We eat out quite a bit, it's just my husband and I at home now. / * 2 slash units?
sd	When we working out we ate out more than that .
o@	* slash error Uh huh. / * slash error
qw	Well, what type of restaurant do you like, Richard?
b	Right.
bh	have you?
sd	We eat, a lot of Chinese food.
qw	What do you look for in a restaurant?
br	You what?
sd	I don't like fast food hamburgers and all of that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I don't care to go to a place just for the price of it .
sd	I mean, it's like continental French restaurant or something really with high prices
sd	and seven courses isn't what I usually look for .
ng^r,o@	It isn't, no that isn't what I look for. / * More than 1 slash unit?
aa	Right .
bf	Presentation
sd	Well, like we've been eating some in a restaurant that just changed hands recently,
sd	and I had a pretty good meal of grilled pork chops and a baked apple and potatoes.
sd	So I said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce, something like that .
sd	that's what I mean by,
sv	It would mean a lot to the looks of the plate.
bf	Tex Mex, Tex Mex.
sd	we like the real Mexican food better than Tex Mex.
qy^g	It's all pretty good, isn't it?
sd	and we're in the mountains in Virginia.
sd	And most of the seafood's frozen.
aa	Right.
sd	Lots of shrimp.
ba	I know it .
sd	and when he goes to Maine, he eats lobster, I guess, at least twice a day, all the time he's up there .
sd^e	It's like two ninety eight a pound for a pound lobster.
b	Yeah.
sd	A lot of the restaurants you can get two one pound lobsters for like ten ninety nine.
sv	it's a good place to go.
sd	Lots of little restaurants, too, with home cooked food, that's up there.
b	uh huh.
sd	We went to Gal ,
sd	We were in Galveston last year well, the first of this year, actually.
sd	and they claimed to have the best shrimp on the Gulf coast.
sd	and they were set up with two buffets, one for their regular Sunday chicken and roast beef and vegetables and everything. And then one complete seafood buffet.
sd	They had shrimp fixed probably six different ways.
sd	It was wonderful.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Not there, but at my brothers I tried it.
sd	he went down and bought some at a local place that steams them, just so we'd try them.
sv	Probably needed some cold beer with it
na	Quite a bit.
b	Oh.
sd	but we don't anymore.
sd	Hate to come away feeling uncomfortable .
qy	Like at hotels, or restaurants there?
sd	We eat at Shoney's.
ba	that sounds nice.
ba	I imagine it is.
qw	out of, which direction?
qw^r	Out of, which direction from there?
b	Uh huh.
qw	Ellen what kind of a car do you think you're going to buy? .
b	Yeah.
qy^d	you do want a lot of that stuff?
sd	you said amenities, that they have,
qw	but what about, their reputation of the company or the price.
sv	other people, don't seem to have the same problem .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as I expected it to be.
sd	but still they cost us money, that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay, on a car that was that new, you know,
sd	well, well, well under two years we had to replace the clutch.
sd(^q)	and I said, since when?
sd	Brake pads are disposable , you know,
sd	but I never thought a clutch was disposable.
sd	so that was kind of a shock .
sd	they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that, that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable.
sv	You would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes, especially not after two years.
h	I don't know.
b	Uh huh.
qw	or like what things are you looking at?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I guess the commercials are getting to me, the Toyota commercials,
sd	and I know that a lot of people I've known that have had Toyotas have been just extremely happy with them, hardly had any problems at all.
sv	I think they have a really good, quality.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	They seem to be really durable.
sd	but I don't know, if the next time I'm going to try to stay with buying something American or if I'm going to go for a little more, what I would consider to be a long term investment .
sd	it's easy to get gas mileage in this car,
sd	it gets excellent gas mileage.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I think so.
ft	thanks .
sd	Actually, I'm real close to being in the market to buy a car.
sd	they're both over ten years old
sd	but I kind of would like to get a more, gas efficient car and a newer model, something looks a little nicer.
sd	and so I need to make sure I've got one that I can fit, all five of us into.
sv	And if you know anything about teenagers it's kind of hard to get them to sit together for any amount of time.
sd	Well, I've kind of been leaning towards a Caravan.
sd	and, couple times I've had a opportunity to rent one
sd	and because if you get the seven passenger version you can put some space between the kids.
sd	Plus it's got, good storage capacity in it for, you know, taking things along, going to the store,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly correct.
sd	usually there's a double seat behind the, front buckets.
sd	Now what you can do is you could take that middle seat out and just have the three seats in the back, and the two seats up front,
sd	You can move, the seats all around.
sd	About the only thing you can't do is take that three person across seat, and move it forward.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think that's getting to be kind of important now that, the price is becoming the driving factor,
sv	and then you looked to see how well you could afford it .
sv	Or how you could afford it.
b	Yeah.
sv	I know they're trying to do everything they can to, end the recession.
sd	so I got a, nine and a half percent interest rate.
sd	But, that is also effecting buying a new car .
sd	Well, that and that,
na	two fourteen year olds will be, fifteen on the fourth of July
sd^e	they're twins born on the bicentennial.
sd	So, I've still got another full year and three months before they're going to be behind the wheel, of a car.
sd	You know, they're, they're small enough that a first time driver could handle it, yet big enough that I feel safe that, if they were in an accident they would survive.
sd	I don't get that kind of feeling with the kind of car like you talked about, the Honda.
bh	Is that right?
b	Right.
ba	Jeez.
b	Yes.
sd	and then there's one, a lap belt.
ad	Make sure you smack him around then .
b	Yeah.
sd	a good source of information I've found has always been these, used car manuals because you can flip through the used car manuals
sd	And you can look at the track record on, a car over the year,
sd	and, you usually notice, a lot of problems at the beginning and then things kind of iron out, to where, there's fewer problems.
sd	Now as long as they aren't changing the model, you know, like when the, Pontiac Grand Prix went from being a huge car to a small car they had a lot of problems, with the smaller car.
sd	As long as they aren't,
b	Uh huh.
aa	sure.
sv	So unless they're really changing the model, yeah, chances are that it's probably going to have the fewer mistakes than it had the year before.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I agree.
qy^d	he did really decide to go?
sd	I'm familiar with it,
qy^d	he must have a definite profession in mind.
qy	Is he excited?
h	but there you go.
qw	where you at?
sd	I'm in, suburban Dallas.
sd	We don't have any kids yet.
sv	About all I can say is I guess about picking schools, I guess, if you don't know what you're going to do, liberal arts program is a good idea.
aa	This is true,
bf	the humanities, the history, yeah,
aa^r	right,
sv	but you know, if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school usually a company, if it's worth it's weight, will subsidize,
^g	right,
b	Right.
ba	Good.
bf	So he wouldn't have gone to something like where we're at, in Austin, Texas, University of Texas,
sd	well I think the other thing is, too, I know I went to a, city high school in Chicago
sd	and economics was the choice
sv	sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school.
b	Uh huh.
sd	University of Pennsylvania,
sv	that's strong,
sv	and it's, well, it's a little bit, I don't want to use the word wilder, that's not the word I want. more diverse ,
qy	At Williams,
qw	Well how large is Williams?
b	Right.
ba	Well that's not bad.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, that has something like either the first or second largest student population, like fifty thousand.
sd	Combined .
sd	and this was twenty years ago .
sd	Showing my age,
ad	well, let's not talk about that .
sd	I mean I just can't say enough about it.
sd	Well you know, my husband's an engineer and , a strong liberal arts background with, a graduate degree in a technical field will get him much further than say like a strong, business administration degree than with another M B A on top of it.
sv	but they usually don't.
sv	I mean, I think, I think all, I think the majority of people just don't know.
sd	he looked at criteria such as location, size of school 
sv	I mean a lot of kids just don't even want to go,
ba	that's not too bad.
sv	he will enjoy Williams I think and is a good academic,
b	Uh huh.
sv	and, So he's developing his, internal instincts right now.
sd	it was too different the level of income of lot of the students
sd	and their attitudes was just, beyond my, in terms of drugs, et cetera, which I thought was shocking.
sd	but then I went,
b	Yeah.
sd	And you're going to get a little bit more input than discipline
sv	but I just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today, I think the refinement that they get I don't mean specifically or culture but just what you're saying, just a solid background because I just don't think at that age I just don't think that young people know what they want to do. You know
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b^m	Video lectures.
qy	did he just make the decision today?
ba	How funny .
ba	That's funny.
bf	He knew what he didn't want
qy	Did your other son,
bc	A clam.
ba	wonderful.
b	Uh huh.
bf@	* I think this should be a slash unit, since A's next utterance follows B's longer turn And now he's a senior / * should be an indep slash unit
qrr	or is this early admissions?
sv	well sounds like you have two talented sons.
sv	but I think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return
sv	and I think it's rather sad,
sv	You are wonderful parents .
sd	I'm thirty something and taking my L S A T s on June tenth.
sv	The point being, and your sons will learn this from you, I'm sure, that, no matter what age you are, you can learn
sd	I'm actually at work.
sd	I'm in facilities and happen to have, weekend duty here.
sd	I'm in the South Building.
sd	there's three of us, facilities' managers are covering the off shifts. Just to have somebody here, from management to, see if they need anything.
qw^t	how many calls have you made?
ad	Go ahead, you first .
ba	good.
b	Okay, yeah.
sd	and then when they actually start off with a computer, and expect you to talk to a computer, that's where I draw the lin , I just hang up immediately, you know.
^h	shut my other radio off here .
sd	and I have one too,
sd	and they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long, if they catch your answering machine,
sd	But they can certainly, block your answering machine so someone else calls you, and your answering machine is full, you know, it won't erase.
sv	That was a good one.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it seems to me that you you kind of yell into it.
sd	He actually, ruins my privacy you might say because the, the T I offices are so open anyway. that I'm amazed that, the fact that I'm about ready to say something, if he's even thought of that that's a real uncourteous thing, an invasion of everyone else's time and concentration to just be loud.
sd	that's, perhaps not quite an invasion of privacy
sd	we both picked phone items there.
ad,qy@	Go ahead, do you have any more? / * Seems to be 2 slash units
ad	but go ahead.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm a, talk show person.
sd	I'm a radio person I guess is what I mean.
sd	And so I listened to, was it five seventy, which has continuous talk on the weekends, and Neil Sperry and everybody, I mean, the lawyers and veterinarians and all that.
sd	even your Social Security number, you know, you should just put down the basics and put N A, where you don't want to answer.
sd	and I was curious as to you know, what specific things you did have to put down.
sd(^q)	But if you don't feel like putting it down, just put N A, you know.
b^r	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and no one was, I guess, really too concerned about it, yet in Austin, there were, whether it was a class action or how far it got, I don't really know because T I only had a few things on T I NEWS I think about it, that they were objecting to
sd	some people object to that which I don't mind, no problem at all, you know.
b	Huh.
b	right.
b	Right.
sd	I served my time too, yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	did they object too?
sd	it doesn't bother me that whether they do it in high schools or, you know, carry it to wherever you want to carry it really, of course, that would really be a big thing in a public school
sd	and I think it is, they found that it's been very low really.
sv	I don't really know if, they need to publish that really.
aa	Right.
sv	but it's something that is for the good of so many people, you know, to, have everyone, take the test right away
sd(^q)	and hopefully, maybe some people will convince other people that are on drugs that, well, I might as well get off, you know, if I want to stay so, you know, if that was an invasion of privacy maybe it was good.
aa	sure.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and we have a really high turn over rate.
sd	you really don't.
b	Yeah.
sd	you have the pick of you know, the crop here.
b	Oh!
bf	You know, your fourteen ounce steak with your potato and stuff.
sd	You can get as dressed up or, you know just going to the local barbecue and just doing take out.
sd	it's good stuff, you kno ,
sd	but, you know, you get a great variety of things here,
qw	But if you were going to a restaurant, say, where would you go?
b	Right.
bk	okay.
b	Oh.
aa	right .
b	I see.
aa	That's true too.
aa	yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	You know, you go out
sd	and you eat your crawfish and jambalaya and stuff.
sd	so, he and a friend of his get together
sd	So when we do go out we really, you know, want to be wowed by, the presentation, so to speak.
sd	and like I said, some of our very favorites are the Chinese restaurants,
sd	and we do a lot of take out because everybody's so busy running around,
sd,o@	and so we sort of enjoy you know, both parts because, * slash unit, because A's next utterance is a backchannel of B.58 Uh huh. / * Should be indep. slash unit
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
bf@	Just to be abused, by the meanest waitress . * slash unit that's a talent. / * Indep. slash unit
^2^g	Got to carry through with the abuse, huh.
sd	and they are all singing arias to you and, and just walking around the restaurant singing
qy	So, do you fish?
qr	from a boat or from shore?
qy	mostly catfish
qy	A real light line, real light rig?
sv	Well, that sounds like fun.
sv	Fish in Colorado different than that.
sd	Mostly trout in the mountains.
sd^e	mountain streams and rivers.
sd^e	Yeah, very much there, you know.
sd^e	but they're big fun.
br	What?
sd	I, I'm a fly fisherman.
sd	but it's fun.
qy^d	You're not casting a weight on the end of the line?
qy^d^r	You're casting the weight of the line.
sd	well, the fly on the end weighs nothing.
sd	It weighs less than the line.
sd	So what you do is, you strip off, four, five, six little rolls, coils, of line into your hand.
sd	As you whip it, over your head, or side to side, you slowly feed out more and more.
sd^e	You fish upstream.
sd	And then you let it carry it downstream.
sd	and you do it again.
aa	exactly.
sd	from what I'm seeing and hearing and all, the big pattern that's really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern.
sd^e	it looks like a grub.
sd	a lure, a fly.
sd	Whenever you have something that looks like something else
sd	and it's a fly, you call it a pattern.
sd	All right, you know, there's bumble bee patterns excuse me. there's bumble patterns, there's mosquito patterns, there's wasp patterns, there's grub patterns.
sd	And, They seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in Fall.
sd	You know how that changes, the phase of the moon
sd	I, You see, I'm from west Texas.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Lubbock.
bf	another west Texan.
ny^r	yeah.
sv	It, It, it's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day.
sd	Well, there you fish mornings and evenings. And nights.
b	Yeah.
sd	It, at times, gets incredibly hot here.
qy	June?
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sv	it's a total experience, you know, getting out in nature and, hearing the crickets, and listening to the birds and, seeing the squirrels and, camping out, and eating out, of doors
sd	I just freeze.
sd	well, you know, ankle deep or standing on the bank, and slipping it out there.
sd	You know, I always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it, out there,
sd	The water's kind of,
sd	and, the next thing you know, your knees are wet.
na	got a stepdaughter.
sd	And, at times she enjoys it, at times not.
sd	A fuzzy little dog.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	you guys sure want to be out of range.
sv	It takes time.
sd	And we still had a good time out, of the deal.
sv	and Colorado is a beautiful place to live.
sd	you've got to work for a living.
qw	What division you all in?
qw^r	What division are you all in?
sd	Well, the only thing up here, is division one.
bh	yeah?
b	Yeah.
sd	fishing's, fishing is fun up here.
sd	But it is fun.
sv	You know, the experience is better up here, I think.
sv	You know, it seems more relaxing, there's more to look at.
sv	and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul . You know, if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake,
sv	it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden.
b	Uh huh.
sd	it gets foamy almost.
sd	And you know it's just pure and pristine. And the froth
ad^t	we can start.
fp	Hi.
sd	I have four.
qw	How many do you have?
bk	Okay.
bk	Okay.
sd^e	because mine are all grown .
sd	I can only relate now to my grandchildren.
sd	I do keep my,
sd	but she gets paid for forty.
sd	and he has to work almost every Saturday
sd	She's three.
aa	Yes.
sd^m	she's little .
sd(^q)	She's says how are you doing grandma today.
fe	Whoa .
sd^e	she's my baby.
sd^r	She's my baby,
sd	She was a miracle baby.
sd^e	she really was.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ny	uh huh.
ny	uh huh.
ba	that's really wonderful.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well they keep you hopping, I'm sure.
sv	and I think it's excellent because she's getting qualified quality time for, her musical, talents her sports abilities
sd	but that hasn't been, possible.
sd	And, she's tried many, avenues
sd(^q)	and so now it's just, you know, that she's kind of resolved herself that, yes, this is going to be the only one .
sd	And they're focusing on all of her, welfare.
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
ba	how wonderful.
ba	Well, that's wonderful.
aa	they are.
aa	No.
sv	Now I think everything is doing, doing, doing, out of the house. Which can be very hectic.
bf	it wasn't so he ,
sv	You have to look on that, on the, positive side of that.
sd	it is.
bf	It's just a different lifestyle.
aa	Yes.
sd	and I know what you're talking about when he's involved, you know, the children are involved in that,
o@	know, * slash unit or part of previous slash unit? Yes. / * slash problem, should be ny
ba	And, I know where you're coming from
sv	and it's very nice.
sv	I think, those type of children, that are involved in things like that, their, goals are going to be set higher than the average child that are not participating in things.
bf	a, a team effort,
sv	That's really is nice to have in your background, that, you know, then you're, you can be very flexible.
sv	And, there's less, friction involved in relationships when you add that skill of teamwork.
sv	And, I mean a lot of people that are adults are having to go back and learn those basics when our children are already learning that.
sv	And I think it's a a, a giant step of progress, I really do.
sv	The best of, Well, Cathy, I think if you look to the Word of God and, think on the things that are pure and lovely
ad	and, keep your mind off of negative things.
ad	and stress that to your children.
ad	And, even if they're discouraged, tell them that that's just a passing moment and to dwell on those things that are, not negative and that are positive things in their life
sv	and when you employ the Word of God there's nothing as powerful as the Word of God.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh
aa	Right.
sv	Well, if she looks, if she looks at it as you suggest that that's, that she can give h , her talent back to the Lord for His glory and she can look at it that way and, that's ...
sd	but now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports.
sd	Well before we had kids, we was in a motorcycle group, you know,
sd	We took, just our little tents,
sd	Then when we started having children we bought a camper. You know,
sd	and we did it that way.
sd	So, we've always enjoyed camping.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Now we have friends with a van,
sd	and when they go on vacation a lot of times they'll just sleep in the van, you know.
sd	and the next night they'll stay at the motel, you know, or something like that.
sd	And they enjoy it.
sd	 me either.
sd	I hate to be on all that stuff .
ba	yeah.
b	Oh.
aa^r	yes.
sd	I mean, it's not something I'd want to do real often.
sd	I'm a sissy.
sd	I either want to do it in the fall or spring.
qh	You know?
aa	Yes.
ng	Well, not really because usually it's when we go off, you know, like for a couple weeks or so.
sd	It's usually like that.
na	Just about.
na^r	Just about.
sd	it really is.
sd^r	It really is.
sd	Also I said we mostly did ours before we started a family.
sd	It's a lot easier then.
b	uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	You know, I just like to go.
sd	I really do.
sd	But usually if we're with a group of people we really don't stay any one place very long.
sd	You know, like if we're just going through and they camp one night and then head on.
sd	But now that we have children and we go every blue moon, I'd rather just go to Galveston. You know .
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	But by the time we really get a chance to it's July, you know,
sd	and it's so hot.
sd	And our camper doesn't have an air conditioner.
sd	I'm sure you could put one in probably,
sd	but we hadn't did that.
sd	And you know, they're in like scouts and stuff like that, you know, so, they get to go camping in those organizations also.
sd	I don't, when they do that.
sd	But, That really is.
qw	Well, how old is your boys, your children?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
sd	Mine's eleven and eight.
sd	So, they really enjoy it too.
sd	You know, they love to go camping.
sd	they would all the time they wanted, you know, wanted to because there's nothing holding them back.
sd	But I'm just not that involved in it.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I don't know what you would do every , you know.
sd	But I guess, my entertainment's, television, I guess .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^g	don't they?
sd	Well, see, we're in a real small county area,
sv	and, you know, that makes a big difference.
sd	Because if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles, you know .
fc	It was nice talking to you too,
fc	and we'll probably be talking to you again.
fc	bye bye.
qy	do you have an idea of how much.
b	Uh huh.
bk	okay.
sv	and maybe that's changed a lot. the way people dress
br^m	More lax?
sv	Maybe a people are a little more open minded than maybe they used to be.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Especially with like a lot of the different organizations now like, you know, Pro Life and Pro , Choice in the special interest groups maybe like amnesty.
sv	maybe people are a little more, free to express their opinions, socially free.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sv	Just wasn't socially acceptable.
sv	and we have to worry about, maybe people are becoming more, more afraid of relationships.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's a it's a much different,
sv	you can't just hope for abstinence.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	kids are a lot more educated now than I think that, like we were, at that age about a lot of things.
sd	and, students learn it earlier.
qy	what are your favorite things to watch?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I like that real well. And CHEERS
qy	do you ever watch that?
sd	I was sort of sorry to see it go too.
b	Yeah.
sd	like the problems that Michael and Hope had in their marriage and stuff, I can relate to some of those things.
sd	Just the dynamics of it and everything.
b	really.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bf	you are too tired to do anything.
sv	it's better to spend time with your kids, I think though, than glued in front of the T V anyway.
sv	I don't think there's as many good things to watch as there used to be, really.
b	yeah.
b	Oh.
sv	it is interesting.
qy	Do you watch sports much on T V?
b	Yeah.
sv	It's slow.
sv	But, you can not take a whole lot of that either,
sv	it's pretty slow.
sd	we went to the movies a lot on weekends and watch them at home, because there's just, on Friday and Saturday nights there's nothing good on
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you have cable T V?
sd	We do not either.
sd	I thought we were the only ones , who did not have it.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Gosh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	we just had all the normal ones, that come
sd	and it seemed like we did not watch even half an hour,
sd	that's the only thing.
sd^t*	Well, I can not, think of too much else to say. * typo cannot? Since we are not big watchers.
fc	Well, it was nice talking to you.
qy	Well, if you had to pick a type of music that you like, would you be able to? / * functions as a qw
qy^m	Country music?
o@	* slash error are you from Texas? / * slash error
qw	Where you from?
sd	so , I'm kind of in a different category here.
h	so, there you go .
sv	It's always about some guy losing some girl and then, you know, playing the guitar and singing about it.
qy	Do you consider her country?
sv	That would be good.
sv	I must admit yeah, they're fantastic,
sv	She's got so much energy .
qy	is she kind of country?
b^r	Kind of .
qo	how about the Oak Ridge Boys.
sd	I've picked up a little bit along the way that I probably wouldn't have if I'd stayed up north, you know.
sv	But maybe twenty years from now they'll look at it as classic rock and roll which I really like
aa	right,
sd	so, I mean, if it stands the test of time, we'll see.
sv(^q)	if it survives, then it'll just probably be one or two songs that sort of, hey listen what we listened to .
sd	and, you know, all these rock stations call it classic soft rock, you know .
sd	But we used to listen to it full blast .
qy	Well, you got any more?
co	and, I'll look at some country.
fc	Bye bye
sd	And I feel like that now if I had gone to a small college that only had a couple of thousand that I wouldn't have gotten as much exposure to different people and I don't know, different languages, different cultures, and things like that just by being around those fifty thousand students.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	so, actually, yes, you were a number.
sv	and I'm sure a lot of people come to, you know, small colleges also but just that they're more of the different cultures there,
sv	but I'm just saying that I think that big,
sd	I have my friends,
sd	and I'm really not as concerned about the entire city, so when you go to a big university, you're not as concerned , about the entire university, but your group of friends, your classes, your interests, your clubs and things like that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^2	On paper.
sd	but it wasn't like a real priority.
sd	and one other point I was going to make, was that I can see that probably if I had gone to a smaller school, I would probably have more friends, because like you said, you know, you know, everybody knows everybody,
sv	you may walk into a company and see someone you went to school with, more so at a small college then a large college.
^h	I guess, let me think of another important thing to look at when you look into college,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's great.
b^r	right.
sd	I've been out of college only two years now, , so it's still pretty fresh on my memory, 
sd	okay, let me go back to my sister now is in college, and my father was really interested in getting her in a school that would look good on her, diploma, etcetera, and so forth,
sd	and I wanted her to get the life experience, out of it,
sd	she went the academic way because she's a straight A student, which is,
sd	but that was the big deal
sv	And that's another point is that, a parent should tell their child to be or to give their child the leeway to choose their school, not so much choose the school for them but, you know, kind of guide them along but let them more or less choose what they need and what they're going to do.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Huh. Right,
b	uh huh.
sv	Well, that was pretty courageous .
o@	so. * slash error yes, / * slash error
sd	That memory just seeps back in my mailbox.
bd	well, I guess I'll get over it.
aa	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm finding out now that what I'm needing the most now is not smarts, not what I can do on paper, it's stamina, courage, ,
sd	words, it,
sd	you know, my, I'm needing to rely on myself,
qo^t	So what are your feelings on the topic today as far as crime in America today?
b	Yeah.
sv	I mean, it's like a bonus to go to jail.
sd	and, when he uses up all that and spends all that money, then he, starts robbing houses again or whatever and gets caught again and goes through the same thing.
sv	Now, see, you talk about, that's a crime right there.
sd	Well, we don't either, in Texas.
sv	it's terrible the way it is right now.
sv	as far as steps to reduce crime, if it's, crimes like we're just been discussing, obviously we need more prisons and more corrective facilities to put these people in to, take them off the streets,
sv	it's not right to put them in there and let them live for years and years and w , years before you do execute them or whatever because has to be very costly to feed a prisoner and to clothe him
sv	and everything else, you know, they can have a good time in.
sd	I'm, I'm pretty much of a hard person,
sd	I mean, you know, if it's just downright, outright,
sv	I mean, that's the only way to,
sv	it's just unbelievable.
bh	Can you really?
ba	God.
sv	Meanwhile, you're living in a country club situation perhaps, you know.
b	Yes.
sv	The drug problem, that's another one.
sd	so I get most of my news like from documentaries like FORTY EIGHT HOURS, TWENTY TWENTY, you know, the news at night. News in the afternoon, that kind of thing.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qy	Are you in the car quite a bit
b	Oh.
bk	I see.
sd	and I watch the news at least twice a day.
sd	and so it seems as if I catch the news right as it happens, you know.
sd	So I usually find out exactly when it happens and that kind of thing.
sd	It's just that, now that I've stayed home, I'm usually aware of when these things occurred
sd	and it happened
b^r	right.
b	Uh huh
b	Huh.
sv	It kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story.
h	That kind of thing.
b	Yeah.
sd	And it's pretty interesting.
ny	Uh huh.
sd^e	Plus, I find that I have to video tape quite a bit of things .
sd	If I don't want any interruptions, you know.
h	That kind of thing.
sd	it seems like ten o'clock at night .
sd^r	but that's what it seems like, ten o'clock at night.
b	Uh huh .
sd^t	I just pressed my,
sv	I think that's kind of an interesting recent thing, that I could think of recently that,
sd	I was wondering what you thought about that getting a general into politics.
sd	and they said in general, generals are more familiar with training, that they believe in training more.
sd(^q)	So, I thought well, maybe.
sv	and Schwartzkopf, you know, might make a good, politician, whether it be Governor or whatever, you know.
sv	everyone has a boss, of course.
b	Yeah.
aa^r	that's true.
sv	That was, pretty easy
ad	go ahead.
sd	Well, I have an easy answer for that, I wish they would do it, is that limit it, you know, to eight or ten years max.
sv	You know, whether that's two five year terms or whatever.
ar	you know, you're not.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	that would be my answer of an easy way to get these guys out of there for twenty years.
sv	My God, it's ridiculous, you know.
sd	I can't believe that a country our big votes for a President from seven o'clock in the morning til seven o'clock at night, you know.
sv	It's just, if you really want the majority of the people to vote then give them a couple of days.
b^r	yeah.
qy	Are you in Dallas?
sd	I am so happy not to be part of Dallas when I see those folks there.
qw	what is the woman's name whose, not the mayor but the, / * typo should be who's
sv	I mean, they're just awful, just awful.
b	Uh huh
sv	and then they don't even do that recommendation, you know.
sv	I mean, it's amazing the money that they spend once they get in.
aa	Well you're right there.
sv	the voting is still not as much as you think in all kinds of issues really.
sd	hopefully people will get more involved.
sd	The guys that don't take any interest in, and constantly on the negative of everything.
bh	And, Is that right?
sv	I think they could do more about, voting.
sd	I could go out and debate George Bush better than I see any Democrat doing it.
sd	because I like competition, you know.
sd*	I can not believe it, you know. / * typo cannot
qy^t	How many times have you called, by the way?
b	really, I, I,
qy^t	You get any cards in the mail?
sd	We'll get to politics, I'm sorry .
aa^r	right.
b	Yeah.
fc	bye bye.
o	Okay.
na	Right.
br^m	Why did I pick music?
sd	plus I like, to listen to music.
sd	is what I really listen to most of the time.
sd	Usually in the fifties.
sd	I think it's a fifties, sixties, and seventies station that I listen to.
bh	really.
sd	but I know a lot of the old songs.
ba	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	I have.
sd	I played the accordion for seven years
sd	and I played that all through high school.
ny	yes.
bk	okay.
sd	And then in concert band I played the bass clarinet.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really.
sd	and I really enjoyed it.
b	Uh huh.
br	Pardon me?
sd^e	I really don't go to very many concerts.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes.
ba	wow.
sd	I would love to be able to go see LES MISERABLES.
ba	my gosh.
ba	Holy smoke.
sd	I would love to go see that, and CATS CHORUS LINE
sd	I would love to be able to go see those.
sd	and so I really didn't have the chance or the money to go see them.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and he said it was the best thing he'd ever seen
sd^r	and he doesn't even like that type of stuff.
bh	really.
b	Oh.
sd	He's more into the New Wave music,
sd	I guess, I don't know either, you know,
sd(^q)	and I thought, my gosh, .
aa	Yeah
sd	I'll listen to anything basically, except I don't like the real hard metal rock.
sd	I like some country.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you like Randy Travis?
b	Uh huh.
qy	Hank Williams Junior?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	well, those should be good albums.
sd	If you have the chance,
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	He's really country himself
sd	but, you know, I, I really enjoy listening to his music.
ad	If I were you, I would get the Greatest Hits album if he had one, because you know, that would have a mixture of all his, you know, top songs on it.
sd	I can't, you know, name the names of them off hand
sd	and all my brothers and sisters listen to them, even the ones that like the heavy metal they really enjoy listening to him,
sv	You know, maybe if you did like Hank Williams and Garth, you know, maybe you would enjoy Randy Travis.
b	Yeah,
qy	I was going to say do you know any other country singers that you would, you know, I mean, the women, do you like the ,
qo	What about you ?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv@	I guess it's where we have to be, we have to keep raising them to keep some of the things that we have and . It's just scary though about, you know.
qh	How high are the taxes going to be when my children are my age?
sv	You know, that's, that's scary too.
sv	So, you know, that's a scary part too, that you have to think about.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh
sv	and that's kind of scary too .
sd	I wanted to see that program.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well you sure do know a lot .
b^r	, yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's true.
qo	What do you think about these items that are going to be, taxed even more. Like, tobacco and that kind of thing .
b	Right.
fp	Mike, I'm calling from Dallas, from Richardson.
sd^t	You know, our subject is on boating and sailing
sd	and, quite honestly, with the exception of being involved in a part ownership of a little bass boat, I have never really got into sailing or boating.
ba	do you, well, great.
ba	Well, that's neat.
b	Right.
sd	it must have slept four people anyway.
b	Right.
ba	I I understand.
aa	I tell you, they are,
sd	and I think of all the time, now that my kids are gone and away and married and going to college or whatever, that I put in there, I just could not imagine a boat because I know it's a lot of maintenance.
ba	gosh
aa	You bet.
aa	Sure.
aa^m	It is a lot of fun.
sd	and they go boat.
sd	if they want to go to the lounge to have a cocktail, they use the boat.
sd	I'm envious, I'm envious of people that have the big boats
aa	You bet.
qy	you think you'd really enjoy it?
b	Yeah.
ba	that's great.
aa	I know.
ba	Well, that's neat.
qw	Who are you with?
ba	Well, good.
qw	What are your favorite programs?
ba	how funny.
sd	well I think I've seen it in the distance.
sd	And I have not seen the program.
sd	people recognized Dallas, Texas, by the Texas, the cowboys and by that program.
sd	It took me a long time, they're talking about the viaducts.
qy^g	that is right, isn't it?
sd	I felt really dumb.
sd	I thought it was going to Oak Cliff over the Trinity.
bh	do they?
bk	I see.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I usually read and watch T V.
o@	And usually I can handle both at the same time, you know. * slash error Because I am pretty sure where the T V plot's going. / * slash segmentation error, should be independent slash unit
sd	Because it's funny.
sd	I really enjoy that one.
sd	and the ones that sometimes will hook me, to put down my book, will be the one, there was one, recently about the Gettysburg Address.
sd	And they wrapped a fictional story around it.
sd	And I thought that was well done.
o@	and I'd never miss it for a minute. * slash error Especially the beauty pageants. / * slash problem
sv	I really dislike those.
"	if it's convenient he'll listen to it.
sd	But he just doesn't watch them on T V like he used to.
b	Yeah
sd	Well, I actually got to go see them win in the Super Bowl when they went down to New Orleans.
sd	and, that was a lot of fun.
sd	But what is a lot of fun to go attend, is this arena football.
sd	I like it so much better than straight football.
sd	it has a lot of different rules.
sd	The field is half the size
sd	It moves a lot faster.
sd	again I think it may be on cable more than anything else.
sd	We don't have cable.
b	Oh.
sd	They're everywhere, they're on every corner.
sd;sv	Everything you've ever wanted to see.
sd	Well, and I like to rent tapes because you can put the thing on hold if you get a telephone call or something like that.
sd	the only thing, this DANCE WITH WOLVES, I want to see it in a theater.
sd	Because I understand that, you'll lose fifty percent of it if you don't.
aa	That's what I hear too.
sd	We will do it.
o	finally.
"	my job tends to be very demanding.
qy	Do you have any personal feelings on the subject?
b	uh huh.
aa^r	I know.
sd	Well I guess my concern is what we are reading, especially in Texas right now with them letting the people out of jail as soon as they are out of prison and having them go right back the day they get out, back in crime. And especially when they are assaulting, people and then killing people, I mean, the man who, killed those three sheriffs deputies, he is out free, walking the street.
sd	I have a real problem, with that.
aa	I think so.
aa	Right.
o@	Well, * slash unit, since A's next turn does not pick up this false start Does not have the right . * slash error Right. / * slash error
b	Right.
sd	And meanwhile, the witnesses, move and die
sd	and there's no one to face them.
sv	Well, they can not get any, if the judge is going to have any award to the victim, it just puts off their collecting it. / * probably should be cannot
sv	It's, it's really bad,
aa^r	uh huh.
sv	A time limit too.
sv,o@	Do not let it, / * Seems that this is continued in A.59
sv,o@	drag on for fifteen years, / * See note above
b	Right.
qrr	or, are there some murders committed that you think leniency should be shown.
b	Uh huh.
qo	And how do you feel about murders of law officers or fire people or something that are, because they have had them, they have had them killed when they have,
o@	* slash error That was their goal. / * slash error
b	Oh.
bf	That would be premeditated .
o@	* slash error They killed him. / * slash error
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	there's no reason, for murder.
sv	I do not care if you are poor or if you are rich or if you are, ugly or what that's just beyond, the,
sd	and all these kids, they have got an excuse for everything.
sv,o@	it's just a bad habit, kids have got to learn from the time they are real little, there's no excuse for being bad or making bad choices deliberate or anything. / * 2 slash units?
sd	if especially violent crime, where serial type killer or maybe a child has been deliberately killed.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and their real estate up there is, I mean ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous.
sd	and it's just the one, it's a one bedroom.
sd	but I prefer to live in a nice part of town because I feel safe here.
sd	And I, I pay more to feel safe, you know.
br	You mean in a one bedroom?
sd	nothing.
sd	I have ceiling fan,
sd	I guess that's something.
sd,o@	It's real cute it's got a little vaulted ceiling and mirrored, / * 2 slash units?
sd	Woodhollow,
sd	right next to Village Green,
sd	kind of far north Waco.
bf	far north, like on Lake Shore where all those apartments are,
sd	it's right up there,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
aa^r	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	So that looks good when you all get ready to sell, you'll probably do really well.
sd	we're originally from the East.
sd	I know I want a big family area,
sd	and every,
sd	I mean, it was just, the ultimate party room, you know,
sd	But that's pretty nice.
sd	I don't like to have a lot of things out, you know, just all over the place,
sd	I like to have them kind of tucked away.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	he had the kitchen, kind of a kitchen and a very long family room,
sd	and what he did, he put, a bar right in the center, and put a glass rack down, so you had like wine glasses hanging from the ceiling and then the bar
sd	Because I personally don't like the combination rooms.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'd like a big backyard.
^2	A little hot.
ad	Try to do it early in the mornings.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
qr	are you looking for a house, or not.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	really.
b	uh huh.
bf	You knew that was it.
sd	I move a lot anyway, because the job I have I only work,
sd	I can move up,
sd	I'm a news reporter.
sd	I work at Channel Six.
sd	so I won't be here very long,
sd	so I'm not even looking to buy anything as permanent as house, you know,
sd	so. It's no biggie.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	like I'm amazed at how much stuff I've accumulated in my apartment, because, up to this point I was in school so I'd go home every summer
sd	and I could take all my stuff home, because I didn't have a bed or a couch or any of that,
^q	I can't go back home for the summer or anything, I have too much stuff.
sd	so I have to move in apartments just because I have so much stuff.
sv^r	it's not.
aa	yeah.
sd	there are tons of apartments down here, I mean,
sd	I think they're called Lake Shore Villa or something.
sd	there was a nursing home or something right there.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	How often do you all come through Waco?
bf	Depends on what's going on.
b	yeah.
bk	all right .
b^r	uh huh.
sd	I mean I'm not a real estate person or anything,
sv	and then the houses are all, most of the houses are pretty nice,
sv	and people are pretty stable here.
sd	You know, I kind of see this as kind of a retirement community, as I always call it.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but , I'll deal with it.
fc	okay well it was very nice talking to you.
fc	you take care,
fc	bye, bye.
qw	what types of music do you like to listen to?
sd	but I'm not sure which composers or which I really like,
sd	so I kind of hesitate to buy something.
sd	There are certain kinds I like and certain kinds I don't.
sd	I understand that.
sd	and I don't sing aloud, to anybody but myself .
sd	I guess I'm real old fashioned in my musical tastes.
aa	Yes.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
aa	I agree with that too.
sv	now rock and roll seems tame compared to like the New Age and all that stuff.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Crops up every so often.
sd	K L T Y.
sd	I like to listen to some of that.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qw	where do you live?
sd(^q)	I said, they're playing one of their ten songs.
sv	and they just play them over and over,
b	Yeah.
sd*	He'd buy all the sound tracts he could get his hands on * typo tracks if he had the money to.
sd	and he likes to do special music and stuff at church.
sd	He does a good job.
sd^e	we're expecting a baby in July.
sd	I guess we'll start listening,
sd	We'll start listening to children's music .
sv	there are.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sv	that sounds really cute.
sd	and I said, then when it's born you can hold it and sing that again
sv	and maybe it'll comfort her, you know, when she's fussy and stuff.
qw	What?
b	Huh.
ba	How strange.
^2	Babbly.
sv	Well, we'll have to keep up with that then.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
bf	have something to rebel against .
sv	variety is good.
fc	It was real good talking to you.
fc	bye.
sd	his health was failing
sd	and two, that he not be put into a home.
sd	But, I think that, my position is that, you need to find one that you can really have confidence that they are taking care of the, of their clients
sd	and, because I've heard about the many abuses, and because he had heard of so many abuses, he just didn't want that.
qo	How about you?
qy^g	all over thirty percent, isn't it.
b	Uh huh.
sv	They're captive.
sd	We had the Visiting Nurses program
sd	and it was a nominal charge that it started out that the lady would come in I think three times a week and eventually got up to the point where they were coming by every day.
sd	Try to get him to talk and be motivated
sd	and then, I think, he became discouraged
sv	and then, at that point I think it's mostly a psychological problem.
sv	There could be a lot of options.
sv	I think it's time that, we decide to do something about it.
sd	I suppose at one time the church would fulfill this need.
sv	the church or synagogue, whatever because typically these were close knit groups at one time,
sv	but in today's large metropolitan areas, or even, even the rural areas now, people are not quite as close as they once were.
sv	there might be some possibilities there.
sv	Although dealing with geriatrics is something a lot of young people just aren't emotionally prepared to do.
qw	what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and we like the water sports too.
sd	But like you, unless you have a pool in your backyard, it is kind of hard to get to do that very often.
sd	We are going to have a baby in July.
sd	So part of my big hobby has been trying to put together a nursery and all that kind of stuff, lately.
sv	it does.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	So, I have not done that in years,
sd	but I have kind of enjoyed that.
sd	It is just hard to find the time to sit there and do it.
aa	yeah.
sd	And I guess I kind of consider shopping a hobby .
sd	I just go out just to enjoy it and not really spend money sometimes, just look.
sd	we bought some baby clothes, yeah, last weekend at a garage sale.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh .
b	Yeah.
sv,o@	it is kind of a hobby, that is time consuming too, really, to find the things that you want sometimes you have to stop * Looks like, including A.61, there are 3 slash units here at a lot of places.
sd	I am not going to work after the baby comes.
sd	So, I guess, hopefully I will have more time for hobbies.
h	I do not know .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
bf	your whole family can enjoy those hobbies.
b	Oh.
sv	That will make the summer go by in a hurry.
sv	Keep the kids busy.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
qrr	or is that just a chore? .
b	Uh huh
b	Yeah.
ba	no.
b	Huh.
nd	well, we like it once in a while but not as often as we have to do it .
sd	I like to put flowers out and, you know, a few little things like that.
sd	But as far as mowing every week, and finding time to get all that stuff done, it gets to be a chore.
sv	They kind of take over and turn into work instead of fun.
bf	If it does not go quite, quite right.
ba	no.
ba	that is nice.
sd	I think I will enjoy cooking more when I am not working, when I do not get home until five thirty or six, and I have to cook and clean up,
sd	But I think I will like it better.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	there again, it is just so hard to find time to get away for a whole weekend.
ba	That sounds fun.
sv	I think that would be a good family thing to start doing more often.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, if you can find some place where those little sunfish are right around the shore where they can just pull in a line.
sd	they have so much fun doing that.
sd	And they think they are really great fishermen because they are catching so many .
b	Oh.
bf	Skip this tournament .
qy	Do you do any other crafts or anything besides your sewing?
sv	It is not too hard.
sv	I do not think it is as hard as like knitting or crochet or something like that.
b	Yeah
sd	I started to knit a sweater.
sd	and so what should have been the back all of a sudden was on the front.
sd	and now I can't remember anything about it .
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah
^2	Forget it.
b	Yeah.
sd	I remember that.
b	Yeah.
sv	They are pretty easy.
fc	Well, it has been real good talking to you.
fc	And I hope you enjoy your camping trip.
fc	Bye.
sd	Personal computers.
qy	So, do you use them?
qw	What kind?
qy	Mostly for word processing type things?
qy	Did you buy a program to handle menus?
ba	yes.
br^m	Eighty eighty eight is what you said?
sv	they're so darned cheap now.
sd	Computers.
ba	no.
sd	and so I'm into computers all the time.
sd	Electronic Data Processing.
sd	and it treats me well.
qy	what are you studying in college computers?
ba	How nice.
sd	How they work is fascinating to me.
bh	Was it.
bf	Hardware stuff,
qo	What do you think of that fuzzy logic?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've written a couple of programs for, commercially,
sd	and it's a fun field.
sd	but you have to take into account, you know, with any computer program all the type of things people can do to you to make your program crash or things you normally don't consider.
bf	pushing keys certain times and, messing up your files and things like that.
qy^d	And you're going to be an computer engineer type.
b^m	Okay.
sv	I think they should either do that, or afford some time to the military, or helping elderly people.
sv	and I'm not sure that that's not a bad idea
sv	or the military for a year or two, wouldn't be bad for,
qo	How about yourself?
sv	I really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is two excellent organizations.
sv	You know, kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that,
sv	There are very few Scouts go on, and become Eagle Scouts.
sd	and I don't know what the high rank is for the gals
bk	okay.
sv	and then when they young adults, there's even less interest there.
sv	They're more for, I g ,
aa	yeah.
sv	you're absolutely right .
sv	of course, there's, you know, third world countries that can use all kind of help .
sv	But I think, we ought to start right here at home.
aa	No,
sv	and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook.
sv	we, I guess we both agree that it's a good thing, that they should do sometime.
fc	and, enjoy the day.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	we're going to talk about the public school system, What's wrong with it, or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it, what should be done about it.
b	Yeah.
sv	I always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough, I mean, to be doing what they're doing,
sd	it just, you know, all the problems.
sv	I'm sure, because they've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready.
sv	you know, and they're being paid, probably half what most people being paid.
sd	And we're paying basketball people, you know, millions of dollars a year for what, you know.
b	Yeah.
qy	Now do you have little kids, or what?
sd	my wife and I have a three year old, almost four and a two year old.
sd	So we're looking at the older one going to school next year. not, well not this coming fall but the year after that.
sd	he's going to be going to kindergarten,
sd	We're going to be teaching him what we can at home, of course, because, I guess we don't trust the school system, which is very sad,
sv	but. But if it doesn't start at home, it's not going to go anywhere. You know,
sv	and we're going to try to teach him good values, because, you know, when, when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them, well hey, if you can play football or basketball that's what's important. Not if you can read or write, or un , understand some science. You know,
sv	that's, that's bogus.
sd	And Dallas, school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling.
sd	I couldn't believe that.
b	Yeah.
sv	That's the only way they're going to fund it, because if they start raising taxes for property, people are going to throw a fit.
b	yeah.
sv	if it works at colleges it will work down below.
sv	But, it will be hard for those that people, that have in school because they have to pay out even more.
fe	I mean, good grief what's .
sd	You never heard about that.
fe	like good grief.
sd	I mean I'm afraid for him to go.
sv	But there again , you can't hold them back.
sd	well I graduated high school in nineteen seventy nine,
qy^d	That was what, twelve years ago, I guess.
qh	And what's it going to be like in another twelve years when my, oldest son is in high school.
sd	I'm afraid to even think about it.
sv	you got to be your child's best friend, I guess, even when they're a teenager and they, you know are kind of standoffish,
sv	still you got to be their best friend because when they've got problems, who they going to go to, their friends that are dealing drugs, or your parents. You know,
sv	and if they go to their friends dealing drugs, they're going to be in even worse shape.
sv	but, it just is amazing, you know,
sv	need to teach them good values.
sv	And the A C L U is going to get after them and have a lawsuit. Which is going to take twenty years to resolve, you know.
b	Yeah.
sv	That's all you can do.
fc	Well I got to be going,
fc	Nice talking to you today.
sd	I don't care, for acid rock,
sd	but, I grew up with country and western,
sd	I even like classical music.
sd	I grew up with Hank Snow, and Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams and all of those old country and western songs.
qy	did you happen to see last night the special on Channel Two with James Galway?
b	Oh.
sv	That is fabulous.
sd^e	when he played DANNY BOY it just almost brought, tears to your eyes, because he can make that flute sing.
sv^e	and, it was tremendous.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd^e	and it was, mostly all Irish tunes,
sd	they had a band with him that, had a harpist and another flute and then a guy that played the bagpipes plus the, tin whistle, and a couple of violins and, drum,
sv	it was just fabulous.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah
sd	I love to just lay back on the couch and turn a good instrumental on and just close my eyes and listen.
sd	I've always wanted too,
sd	I've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something,
sd	but I'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music
sd	I guess the closest I've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	an I don't care for rap music either.
aa	no.
sd	If I can't understand the words I don't want to listen to it.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	But, and I love, I like orchestra music too. Like the, Boston Pops or, or anything.
ny	Uh huh.
sv^e	they're good.
sd	And, we went and saw, L , LES MISERABLES
sv	the music in that was fantastic.
b	Yeah.
sv	and, it was well worth the price.
ny	Yeah,
b^r	Yeah.
sd	just ever so often you know, a real good one like that one
sv	that had good music in it.
sd	I got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it, Helen something.
sd	real long legs, and dark hair.
sd	I can't think of it.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
b^r	yeah.
^2	The Blackwoods.
b	Yeah.
^2	Alabama.
b	Yeah
^2	either Alabama or Hank Williams, Junior.
sd	and I never have figured out how he won, entertainer of the year for about, three or four years in a row.
b	Yeah.
sd	I guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is, probably Eddy Arnold.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	But, I've got about a hundred and, or had a, some, I sold some of them, I had about a hundred and fifty old seventy eight R P M records of country and western, songs,
qy^d	Smiley Burnette, I don't know if you were old enough to remember him.
sv	I think his name in the movie was Froggy
sd	had a real raspy voice,
sd	some of those old ones, of course, Bob Wills, Miss Texas Playboys Ernest Tubbs and Red Foley an,
sd	I took them up here to Collectors Records and was able to get a little money for them
sd	but, my mother and dad use to, own a restaurant,
sd	and they had a, nickelodeon, of course, in the restaurant,
sd	and when they would come and change the records the guy would give her the old records
sd	so, that's where I got my,
sv	Of course, there's not a whole lot of market for seventy eight R P M records.
sv	Well, the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because, you have to have that, particular kind of needle
sd	and, they, just won't play on a modern day, phonograph.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sv	Of course, they, you know, just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because, you get that scratchy sound.
ny^r	yeah.
sd	warped real easy.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	back then when I was a kid, there wasn't that much T V,
sd	so that's all you had to listen to was the, radio,
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	I remember mother and dad always turned on the Grand Ole Opera.
b^m	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
qw	could you tell me what you think contributes most to, air pollution?
sv	I think probably the greatest cause is, vehicles, especially around cities.
qy	do you live right in the city itself?
qy	so ca , Can you notice,
sd	I live in a rural area.
sd	I live in Rhode Island.
sd	and Attleboro sits in just over the line, where T I's plant is,
sd	they're swinging wider so that now they are coming over our homes.
sd	But, other than that, you know, we don't have unless we're catching it from the midwest, the emissions. You know from the power plants.
sd	but I'm not sure about the rest of the country.
bh	well, is that right? .
ba	surprise, surprise.
sv	there must be, some of the, larger plants up around one hundred twenty eight.
sd	during the night seems like they'd blow off their stacks from, the warehouses, for powerhouses,
sd	and, they do that at night too, because, employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted, and, you know, spots all over them.
sv	they could do something about, about that, I guess.
qo	How are your lakes,
qy^d	They have?
sd	that's what I was,
sd	upstate New York somewhere, over huge areas,
sd	and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback.
sd	and I can't remember where.
sv	So, that's interesting because New Hampshire, and parts of Vermont, they showed pictures of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain.
qy	you kind of think it's something else then?
"	they just said they thought it was,
bf	natural disease,
b^r	yeah.
sv	I still think that's, one of our major causes of pollutants.
sv	how we go about that, it's a little bit difficult.
sv	yo , ne , I think you need a vehicle something like, Ralph Nader, Nader's Raiders, or, or, A A R P, which has a lot of members. if you can get those types of groups.
b	Yeah,
qw	when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch, smoke, or,
sd	fuel is one of their biggest costs.
sd^m	diesel engines.
sv	This country seems to be a little behind on that.
sv	but only because we got used to, single person, single car, driving.
sv	A lot of people don't even like to carpool.
sv	That'll help, air pollution,
sd	The, United States and Canada is, is, going into, some types of agreements to limit, what's being given out by power plants,
sd	I guess Canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up there,
sv	So that's helping.
ad	don't say that too loud though because, every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating revenue,
qy	Is that your idea?
sd	you could, you could, it could be installed like a catalytic converter.
sv	I mean I guess you could take those off too
sd	well not unless it was built into every muffler.
sv	You should, pursue that I think, or patent it, you know.
sv	If you could come up with a device that's the thing.
sd	But that's a thought.
sv	I don't know if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that.
sv	but you know a proposal to, I guess the proper authorities,
sv	well you might, generate some
sv	Other than that I'm not sure what individuals can do other than like I said get involved through a group or an organization.
fp	How are you?
sd	Massachusetts.
sd	This is quite a long distance.
qy	Do you have any pets?
qy	You get tired of them?
b	Yeah.
br	I beg your pardon?
sd	a toy poodle
sd	This is a little bigger than a teacup.
sv	Well, after you had an animal for a couple of weeks, you become you become attached to it.
sd	But she's usually pretty good.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ad	Well, you might want to get yourself, an animal that doesn't require much attention. Like a cat.
b	Yeah.
sv	 they're, they're affectionate
sv	I can't seem to communicate with a cat like I can with my dog.
sv	I don't know that a cat would do that, .
b	Yeah.
b^r	yeah.
sd	I think, in a way we're able to read each other pretty well because, she knows when I'm upset and I know when she's not feeling good too .
sd	When when she was younger, she used to do that to get even with me,
sd	but, but, I do .
sd	Like if I put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours, because I was going out. She would, break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to, to let me know that she was unhappy with what I did .
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Animals have a way of talking .
sd	It cost me over five hundred dollars.
sd	It's been about two years now.
sd	I probably would have had second thoughts.
sd	So that that was kind of a surprise
sd	and then the cat, died.
sd	So another five or six weeks I'll be bringing the little kitten over to my folks.
sv	I think they enjoy that.
aa	Yeah.
fc	Well, the same here.
fc	Bye now.
qw	What is that sound?
fc	I'll let you go.
fc	Right .
sd	but, I don't know if its their proposal or one that's being seriously kicked around.
sv	I've always felt for a long time that I think that all young kids ought to do a stint, primarily in the military.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I mean, everybody does.
sd	I mean, I went in the service when I was eighteen, And, stayed in for ten years.
sd^e	did a lot of growing up.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
^2	Do it himself.
sd	You know, I had wanderlust, you know.
sd	So I started to work on my education.
sd	Course my job was such that I couldn't do it as much as I wanted
sd	and still I ended up going two semesters when I got out just to get my degree.
sd	But, I've been in school ever since .
sv	I guess.
sd	I mean if you don't like,
ba	Exactly.
sv	and if they're able bodied people, I don't see any problem at all with having them go out there and, if nothing else, get a group of them together and take them around to old folks places and let them cut the yards, paint the houses.
sv	get something out of that money.
sd	and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able bodied
sd	and, back in those days they also use to give you, booklets good for, clothing and gas, and things like this .
sd	They get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games you know,
sd	and I jus , I have a hard time dealing with that.
b	Uh huh.
sd	you, you think about, you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient,
sv	and there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy.
sd	and, quite honestly I just got so fed up with it I just couldn't stand it any more.
sd^e	I mean, this is the kind of thing you look at.
sv	Well just ridiculous.
sv	This is ridiculous.
sv	I mean, these these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks.
sd	and I would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance.
sd	Give an incentive.
sd	Something that's going to help them along the way.
ad	I mean I mean, look at the statistics,
sd	One in five Americans can't read
sd	and we've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math.
sv	We're becoming a service country.
sv	and they did it better than we do.
sd	Simple as that.
sd	simple as that.
sv	it's terrible for us.
sv	and it can be good for them, too.
aa^r	I know.
sv	Well, you know, you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house.
sv	Parents aren't parents any more.
sd	One of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble?
sv	Well, as a substitute teacher for a year, I can say yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Exactly.
sv	but you have to look out for yourself you know,
sv	and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers,
fe	gosh,
sd	I mean, I have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that.
sv	But, I mean, there's a sense of priorities here, too.
qh	what's more important, picking up the garbage or educating our kids.
aa	sure.
ad	I mean, on the other hand, I mean, you take a garbage man in New York City starts out at twenty six thousand dollars.
sd	Well I bet you there's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year.
sd	I mean, my other pet peeve is unions.
sv	There was a time when unions were needed.
sv	and they're only there to perpetuate their own power structure.
b	Yeah.
sv	and and that's really what happened to the steel industry in this country.
sv	And, well, that took care of that industry
sv	Detroit worked awfully hard on stopping car manufacturing in this country.
sv	and I don't think we ever will.
sv	and we've got to go into partnership with the Japanese to build cars.
sv	You know . And they only did it because I guess they were embarrassed that they're so good at it .
sd	I don't care what kind it is.
sv	and pride in themselves, too.
sv	they could, I mean, you could organize something just within your community. same old thing.
aa	Uh huh.
sv	and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have.
qo	How about you?
sv	probably right, if you look at it from that stand point.
qy	is there anything, that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing?
qr	Do you live in a real small town or out in the country?
qw	How far out from the city, I mean, do you,
sd	I live in a little suburb, which I guess from Dallas is twelve miles or so
sv	Our major crimes in our immediate town, is probably house robberies and very few instances of, you know, alcohol, drugs, reported.
sv	However, I'm sure they're there.
sd	But, right now our neighborhood is running about, eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed, sometime during their, existence in that neighborhood.
sd	And since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or, you know, burglar alarms and including the outer perimeter type, devices, sensors and things like that.
sv	so it still, remains city wide, pretty high.
sv	I would say the majority of it's happening during the day, between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon.
sd	and both people are working.
sd	So they're happening during the hours they're gone from work.
sv	they'll stock your house and, look at your pattern and then go from there.
sd	you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier, just taking, you know, just junk items that they can just get, you know, ten to twenty bucks for real quick.
sd	the, you know, Mercedes, Volvos, things that they can get, you know, big dollars for and the jewelry are the major targets,
sd	Very few, you know, penny ante stuff.
sd	and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty, for that amount of people which is not very many.
sd	so they're giving the early release,
sd	I think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences,
na	That would certainly be a deterrent.
ad	You know, if they're overcrowded, just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate.
sv	Course, I know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof.
aa	I'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence, to convict somebody
sd	and then those convicted, especially of, you know, murder and, you know, major crimes, to reach the life sentences and, you know, death penalties and follow through with that.
sd	especially, you know, in the case of murder
sd	I know in my case, my wife and daughter were kidnapped, during a house robbery back in eighty five
sd	we, we went through the court system and all that sort of thing
sd	and, you know, two counts of kidnapping, you know, the forty five to the head, you know, just the mental anguish and the whole nine yards you know, the guy only got five years.
sd	And, you know, he was out within two months because of the parole system.
br	Do what now?
sd^e	I'm not real familiar with that.
^q	there's nothing that he has that you could go after.
aa	Yeah.
sd	you or the insurance companies never see any of that money.
sd	they, been in jail before ,
sv	they've been released, you know, several times, which is another, deal I hate to see.
sd	But, you know, basically the guy commits, you know three major crimes and, and car theft on top of it, destroys my car,
sd	and, you know, the guy gets out in two months
sd	Fact, he's back in jail now.
qh	what deterrent does he really have?
sv	I think in our particular neighborhood, vigilantism is becoming a real possibility.
sd	we've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually, you know, shot the people
sd	then other people will wait up, you know, and wait for somebody to do something else, try to take it in their own hands.
sd	Course it doesn't always work out in their favor.
sd(^q)	But, nevertheless, I think people are just getting fed up and saying, you know, you can't arrest all of us,
^q	you can, you know, you can get some of us,
^q	you can't get all of us.
sd	and we're beginning to see more and more of that.
b	Yeah.
sd	we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in, you know, during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death.
sd	And, it helps for a while
sv	I would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught, they're from places like up in Oklahoma, and Louisiana, Arkansas, you know, across the border.
sd	So, you know, people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever
sv	it's not many from the local communities.
sv	and I just, I think that the court systems need to be more in, stiffer in their penalties,
sv	and, and, giving the, police, agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they catch these people.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know like in my wife's case, they made her feel like the criminal.
qy	have you painted something lately?
b	Yeah.
qy^d	another bedroom.
ny^r	Yeah.
b	yeah
sd	Well, I painted the outside of my house and one bathroom.
sd	But I have that problem with the ceiling, you know, the blown, ceiling. You know where you get around the edge.
qw	Well, how do you get the edge though?
aa	the straight edge?
b	I see.
b^r	Uh huh.
qy	Well are you going to paint the outside of your house too?
bh	really?
ba	nice.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
^2	or two tone. You know.
b	Uh huh.
sd	White.
sd	and we can't paint the chimney .
sd	We are just not willing to get up that high.
sd	but and the only thing I would consider a professional, maybe doing that,
sd	other than doing our own work I prefer it to a professional.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
qy^d	The blowers?
sd	I know what you are talking about.
sd	That's it .
b	Yeah.
sv	So that was worth it getting a professional for that.
sd	but other than that, it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself.
sv	It wasn't too bad.
sd	Shoot, maybe a hundred and fifty.
sd	But then that way you know you are assured you did a good job than you are, you know, if you hire someone to do it.
b	Uh huh.
ba	My word.
ba	my word.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
ba	my word.
bf	So that was really worth it. Painting his own house.
sd	Well, he really saved in that way.
sd	I want to do it about the same color. And just be a little,
qy	are you on a regular exercise program right now?
sd	well, I'm kind of off and on.
sd	Right now I'm kind of off.
qw	what type of exercise do you do?
qy^d	I guess you don't enjoy that very much.
qy	Do you find that, to be boring?
sd	Well, I'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring.
qy^d	I don't know if you've seen those advertised on T V.
sd	so it's collecting dust right now.
sd	I used to jog somewhat.
sd	when I go visit them, I get on that thing every now and then.
sd	had to get out to do something.
sd	so thought I, better get outside and do something and not waist the day.
sd	and so I really don't ever keep a program up consistently.
sd	I usually only go about a mile or two.
sv	it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete, or on asphalt.
sv	Suppose to be much better if you find grass, or dirt to jog on.
sv	that's, very important.
sd	my don't get very much use .
sd	But, that gets old too in a very short order,
sd	I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis.
b	Yeah.
sd	Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can, start some type of, regular program.
sd	I've always found that, when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep something going.
sd	an, one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine, lifting weights and, working out like that.
sd	we kept charts of our progress, and, consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks.
sd	I found that to be, very helpful.
sv	but, it's a thought.
sv	Sounds like something I should do.
qw	How often do you, go out each week on your walking?
qw	about how far do you go walking?
bk	Okay.
sv	Well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging.
b	Sure.
sv	Well, if you keep up with a consistent pace just to, keep the heart rating going,
b	Yeah.
sv	But it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is.
qrr	or do you watch, on T V?
bk	Okay.
qw	Which, shows do you watch on T V?
bf	like a Cathy Smith workout,
bk	Okay .
sd	I get cable on T V,
qw	and, what is the other one called.
b	Uh huh.
sd	BODIES IN MOTION that's the name of the one I was thinking of. With Gill.
sd	They're always in Hawaii some place. on the beach.
o@	* why utt? this is notes about transcription they're on every day.
sd^e	every morning.
sd	I can't remember offhand what time.
b	Yeah
b	Yeah,
sv	well, I found that they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on T V.
o@	* again why utt? I actually taped a few session that they had on there
sd	but, I haven't done so much as, watch the tape that I made.
fc	well, I sure enjoyed, to you about exercise and fitness.
fc	So, all right.
fc	Good night.
qo	how do you feel about it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	You have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that.
b	Yeah.
sv	But if someone's really determined to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place.
sv	And you can get them really cheap.
b	Uh huh.
qw	How long was the waiting period out there?
sv	That wasn't too bad.
sv	In other words, you know, you don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day.
sd	They both do the same kind of job.
sv	I think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd	The further away I get, the, wider the shot gets from the target.
sd	It's got a hell of a kick to it.
qr	Do you belong to a gun club or you?
b	Uh huh.
ba	No kidding.
sd	Plus you have to pay for the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in.
b	Uh huh.
sv	In fact, I'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to, show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon.
sd	And you give him a license because he waited nine days.
sv	he could, mishandle a weapon. Leave it at home and let a child get at it.
sd	he could of hit something else .
ba	Wow.
qrr	or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system, because you own it?
qy	isn't there a way to deregister yourself after you register a gun?
qy	Is it registered?
sd	and, I don't know why I never registered it
sv	I think it's voluntary .
b	Yeah.
sd	And once they have your number, they have your identification.
sv	And if you try to do anything, like, not identify yourself to the government, they know who you are.
aa	And , that's true .
bf	you were talking about, what the Federal government knows about people.
aa	They probably do.
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you find it difficult picking up, guns that are not registered?
sd	Just you know, put up the money.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	And there's no waiting period on that.
bf	To sell the refrigerator?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	so I can't complain too much.
sd	I, weight train, three days on and one day off.
qo	What about yourself?
bk	Uh huh.
bh	really?
qr	what do you ride, like, a bunch of hills or pretty flat?
qw	How long does that take you to get to work?
qw	how does that work out with, storing your bike and showering and all that?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qy	Do you ride a lot of rallies or a lot of those around there?
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I did an internship at the Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas, the Cooper Clinic,
sd	I was a solid weight trainer,
sd	so, once I got into this, internship, I learned all the physiological advan , advantages to it,
sd	I usually, you know, fifteen or twenty.
sd	but, I'm looking at, doing a lot more of it because, you know, my wife is really into it,
sd	but, you know, she wanted to stay with me .
aa	it really is.
sv^e	that would be cool sometime if I could, you know, work up to that.
b	Oh.
sd	my wife would just love that.
sd	There again, I'm just kind of a fledgling into this.
sd	and I was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up.
sd	if you live around the Dallas area, you got five or six every weekend to choose from. Because they're really into it.
sd	I didn't know that, you know, until I came down here, and, kind of caught the fever.
sd	and, you know, you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle or above the age of fifteen or something,
sd	but, other than that it's nothing up there like it is down here.
b	Yeah.
sv	it's really neat.
sd	so I guess I'm going to be busy about every Saturday this summer, going to a different ride.
sd	see a little bit of Texas I've never seen before.
qw	So, how long have you been biking?
bk	Yeah.
qy	Have it's kind of slightly off the subject, but you ever had a, a blood workup done recently or since you've been biking, to see if it,
sd	and, you know, it kind of knocks down two of the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is, low cardiovascular fitness, and also, you know, the cholesterol.
sd	It gives you increased H D Ls and decreases your L D Ls.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
bh	Really?
ba	That's good.
qy^d	You say you ride about a hundred, hundred fifty miles a week?
sv	that's hard core.
qy	do you ride inside if you can't ride outside?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bf	So you, change up your routes a lot, and keep a ...
qw	So, what school is it?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	Sounds neat.
sv	That's, motivating.
fc	Well good talking to you
fc	and keep up the good work.
fc	Take care.
sd	I always wanted to know who an expert was.
sd	when they replace it, you know, they're going to really come up with something that is not just as bad.
sd	but that it seems to be,
sd^e	I heard about it though.
qrr	or it was w ,
^2	Because of that, you know.
b	Right.
qy^d	you didn't work at T I?
bk	okay.
qy	Where do you work in research,
bk	okay.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think that the changing, you know, from leaded fuel was a tremendous advantage, you know, not using ...
nn^r	no.
ad^t	we ought to talk about that one day,
sd	I think you can use you know, the ninety two octane I don't think you'll have any trouble.
sd	I'm saying, I was glad to get rid of leaded gasoline,
qy	Did you see any of those, I,
sd	although, I thought it was on C N N,
sd	and how it would essentially literally destroy the world, you know.
sv	there's probably a lot of natural things,
sd	I don't know if it's air pollution it's dust pollution whether it's natural or not I don't know.
sd	the only buses you see are school buses,
sd	but, I think people would be interested if you had one, I mean.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think that, all of us could use one electric car right now, I mean, today, because I think, you said people drive forty miles and fifty whatever,
sd	but I think we all could, in a family, say, have an electric car where one of my daughters or my wife, she could use one now if they had one, you know, because she doesn't put fifty miles a day on the car.
sd	but, they have a battery car.
sd	but now that you just mentioned that.
sd	we're nine years away or less, I guess, from the next century and I think,
sd	and it's probably more generating power for, you know, electricity, a hundred and twenty volt or whatever.
sd^e	I'm actually in the south building
sd	so I've been in most of the buildings anyway.
 sd	It's, right there on the first floor you walk by there.
sd	and I guess it's just not, economical yet because of the other fuels.
sd	It was just pure automobiles.
qy	There?
sd	I didn't see,
qy	did you go?
bk	Oh.
sd	of course, they're burning gasoline, of course.
 b	Oh.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Sure.
sd	I think it would be very interesting to do but whether it would be feasible to do I don't know.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	I'm sure you probably have heard of the Genesis program that's going on currently out in the Arizona desert.
sv	and the people, their moods are extreme, you know.
sd	So I wonder how, you know, somebody living up in space is going to be able to tolerate never seeing the sun . You know, in the aspect that we see it. and never seeing, you know, light, bright days, you know.
qr	would you, like to begin or would you like me to start?
bk	Okay.
b	Yes.
 b	Uh huh.
aa	I agree.
b	Right.
sv	I think you do see more and more women out there in politics, too, as mayors or, you know, in helping to maybe, get some legislation passed to have women have more rights.
sv	and I just think that it's still going to take another generation or so before, before the women could really feel that they're really equal in the business world and that they work just as hard or harder .
sv	going from homemakers into, corporate leaders is still a big step.
b	Right.
aa	Yes.
sv	I think also people are having children at a older age
sv	and, you know both sides of the coin.
sv	But then when they're in their thirties and have their first and second kid, it's like, they lose it .
^q	This is harder than I thought .
ba^r	I know.
b	Uh huh.
 ^2	Are so involved.
aa	Yes.
sv	Their role has to change to kind of accommodate us, too.
sd	and I was just out of the house two days a week
sd	my husband still got up and went to work
sd	I don't think I could swing that personally.
ba	boy.
b	Right.
ba^r	I bet.
sv	and that's not considered really young these days,
qw	So, what do you think of our trial system? .
b	Yeah.
ny^r	yeah.
sd	I don't, I don't even know what to do about that sort of thing.
sv	I think that's actually good idea.
na	We , just sentencing, not the trial itself.
sv	because I think th , that, that judges are probably more informed as to how serious the nature of the crime is, and stuff like that
b	Right.
sv	so he'll be able to give them the maximum sentence, in some cases there.
sd^t	they give that as an example of something that, that might happen ye ,
aa	yes.
sv	there are two people who say well he just looks guilty,
sd	when you're called for duty say oh yeah, I want to be on jury duty because I can spot a guilty person a mile a way.
sv	They quickly let you off jury duty I hear,
sv	and they can't decide for hours, unless they convince that one person, you know.
na	I believe it does have to be unanimous, actually.
sv^e	I think they either have a retrial eventually or they call it a mistrial or something.
sd	I haven't been to law school.
sd	I think well, what if I were that one person and I was completely convinced that, that, that this person wasn't guilty, you know.
sd	but, I mean what if eleven other people are saying one thing, you know, and you're, you're the one person saying the other thing.
sv	You know, would you give in.
^2	saying .
sv	what's the cut off number, seven, five, you know, six, six,
qh	how do you decide what number of people have to say that.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I've never quite understood that.
b	Okay.
sd	and they can't do anything about it.
qy	or can they, you know, bring you back.
sd	I've seen the same thing on L A LAW as well.
sv	you know, something like, well you can't be tried for the same trial because that would bias the, the, the jury or something,
b	uh huh.
sv	when someone is on trial for something, you can't bring up prior convictions.
sd	that's completely beyond me,
sv	I mean if this man is accused of raping someone, then I think that something like sex, you know, the fact that he sexually assaulted someone is a crucial bit of evidence, that adds to the fact,
sv	and I'm sure that, that there are some reasons for good.
b	Right.
b	Then right,
sd	but I don't quite understand.
br	Do I vote?
ny	yes.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sv	but then again often times they don't, as well.
sv^r	Often times they don't,
sv	and they sort of don't care about anything and just want to go ahead an,
ba^r	that's true.
sd	I wonder about the politics of it all,
sv	I mean, that's even another issue, you know,
sd	we had, a serial killer around here, who killed eleven women.
sd^e	his name is Arthur .
sd	'cause he was just on trial like maybe a year ago.
sd	he was strangling some of them.
sd^e	usually they were prostitutes, actually.
sd	he was in prison for, sexually assaulting two children.
sd	and they, they realized later he had killed about between eleven and twelve women, at least
b	really,
bf	way up north here,
sd	Still way up north, sort of,
sd	and what they were pleading was, they were pleading insanity.
sd	I mean it's clear to me the man is insane.
sv	and he should be just locked up for life.
sv	and by the end, I realized that maybe it would have been better if it wouldn't have been a jury of his peers, but if they had a jury of psychiatrists instead, to sort look at it, you know.
sv	but, it would be an interesting thought if you're,
sv	but give them a bunch of psychotics but at least have a, have a bunch of psychiatrists, you know, just to look at him and decide from then.
sd^t	Advice for parents, help their kids through college.
sd	I just graduated from college.
ny	Yes.
sd	I went to Clarion.
aa	Uh huh.
sd	I would want them to make that decision
sd	I pretty much made my decision on my own and my older brother, likewise.
sd	And, you know, we were both pretty much happy with what we did.
sd	So, I think, I would not push them towards any one place.
 b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
 aa	exactly.
 sd	I think one of the first things kids ought to look for is, first of all, they have to decide what they want to major in. And then, you know, find a school that's good for that.
ng	Well I picked it for a couple of reasons, it was only about an hour and ten minutes away from home, so it was far enough away that I was away, but yet close enough if I ever wanted to go home, I could.
sd^e	I lived up at school.
sd	another reason was, I paid for my entire education. So I had to look for something that I could afford economically.
sd	You know, and, it was roughly around six thousand a year.
sd	and I did not order out a lot,
 sd	and you know, I did not spend money on myself.
 %	so,
 sd	they are known as a teacher's school and also for their business.
sd	So, that's what I ended up going for is for business.
aa	Uh huh.
sd	so I am not looking around here.
sd	Maryland.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	My fiancee is down there .
aa	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
 b	Uh huh.
 b	yeah.
 sv	It does have a lot of bearing on it, whether you are paying for yourself,
 +	or whether your parents are, you know.
 ^q	If you goof,
 sv	that's not that wonderful either.
 sd	I worked.
 b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
sd	and I pulled myself from a two oh to a two five, you know,
 +	in my senior year.
 sd	But I would have really liked to go on, secondary ed with math education,
 b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
qy	are you there?
qo	How about yourself?
 qy	Did you ev , Did you ever do the James River?
 b	Uh huh.
sd	and the trout fishing is supposed to be legendary.
 b	Yeah.
qy	Do you fly fish, or are those streams too small?
b	Yeah.
sd	but right now it's, bass and striped bass is the only thing that I go for down in, Texas.
 sd	and they're pretty exciting when they're running.
qy^d	April to October or something like that?
b	Uh huh.
qw	what's a license cost?
 sd	It's about the same as Texas.
sd	Well, I have all sons, so I think I'm probably going to be fishing for a long time .
sd	It's really ,
ny	yeah.
 b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Right.
 b	Uh huh.
 qy	Are there many?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	What do you do there in Lubbock as far as, recycling is concerned?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Wha , what would be more efficient about it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I, I, was going to say cause I know I have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for for paper on it you know
sd	and, if if if I printed up something that I don't need it, just chunk it in the paper.
ba	That's true.
ba	Certainly that's a good idea.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I have heard in residential situations, like in Plano that they are doing, stuff like having recycle picked up
sd	Doesn't really cost the, department.
sd	they don't pay for the recycled items.
b	Uh huh.
sv	you know if you you wanted to recycle you newspapers it was impossible.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, that's good.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	would you tend to chose the one that does
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
o	Okay.
sd	well, right now we have one dog inside.
sd	but I mean she's an indoor dog.
sd	And two outside cats.
sd	Male and female.
sd	the dog is probably about thirteen, fourteen years old.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	is that right?
qw	What kind of dog do you have?
 sd	that's what ours is .
ny	Yes.
sd	White.
b	uh huh.
ba	I'll be darned.
b	Yeah.
 b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, that's to be expected at,
 +	their age.
 b	Yeah.
sv	Well, everybody always says no more .
sv	But I think animals are really important in the family.
sd^e	we, have five.
sd	She was fifteen when she died.
sd	a farmer called us and wanted us to call or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this puppy that, somebody,
sv	people drop things like that off, up there,
sd(^q)	I told the kids, "Let's go look at her" .
sd	So that's how we got her, quite by accident.
 b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Oh.
^q	She picked us .
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	for heaven's sake.
sv	But they say it's real important for children to have pets because, well, they can go and talk to them any time,
sv	and, nobody is going to, you know, reprimand them or, know their secrets
 %	or ,
b	Yes .
sv	And the nursing homes now, they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home.
b	Uh huh.
sd	our one nursing home in has one.
sd	Permanent .
na	he kind of has free run of the place, and there is or somebody takes care of him.
sv	and real nice dog,
b	Uh huh.
 bh	really?
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sv	because most campuses don't allow pets, you know,
sv	they just do not allow them.
sv	that's kind of great.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	we've ruined them .
sv	They say ruined them .
sd	the kids had rabbits for pets,
sd	and we also raised them for food, at one time.
sd	And . We've had a skunk for a pet. For more years than I want to think about .
sd	She was in the house .
ad	Well, don't ever get one for a pet.
sd	they don't ever learn their name.
sd	you could never call her and she would come to you,
sd	you had to go chase her down.
sd	And, their eyesight, they can't see very far either.
sd(^q)	before we got her, everybody said, "Oh, they're just like a cat," you know.
sd	That's about it .
sd	Probably seven or eight years.
sd	and I don't think she was there a week till the men built her a pen outside .
sd	And I thought, I put up with that all those years .
sd	And, we've had cats, stay in the house.
sd@	we had two Siamese cats. Different times.
sd	and the second time he never came back.
sd	And we would see him, several miles from our house,
sd	he kind of moved into a woods down there.
sd	And he got huge down there.
sd	but he, he never came back.
 sd	Well, he wasn't a whole lot.
sd	He was in the house most the time,
sd	it makes a much nicer cat if they're outside.
sd	and the vet had told us they get strange, if they're kept in the house all the time.
sd	it did get strange .
sd	And since they've moved to where they let the cat out.
sd	I usually watch those prime time programs.
sd	You know, the Sunday night movies, I watch those kind of things. but basically a lot of documentary things and, you know, what's going on and that kind of thing.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it's hard to follow.
 sd	I've never seen that one.
sd	I've seen the previews for that.
b	Uh huh.
sd	or we try not to miss that.
na	we think it is, so funny.
na	just part of it .
b	Uh huh.
nn	No.
sd	they thought it was the neighbor.
b	Yeah.
sd	And then, it's, it appeared that maybe it probably wasn't the neighbor.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've never seen that program.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	okay.
b	right.
sd	if I can catch them, I do. Or if I remember.
sd	I watch one
b	Oh.
b	okay.
sd	that's been on for years.
qy^d	and so you get to come home and watch them .
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
sd	but we just canceled it last week because it seemed like it was so repetitious, you know.
sv	if you're up then .
b	Right.
b	Right.
qw^t	About how many calls have you made on this system?
b	yeah.
sd^t	So I started about a month ago
sd	but I don't really know.
qy^d^t	you've a few?
sd	That's mine.
ad	Go ahead, you first.
b	Uh huh.
sd	the ones, that I think are the highest and important to me, I hope I never have to use them, really per se, although I've used medical a little bit
sv	I sure like that one.
sd	you like to have it there.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Right.
qr	With T I, or somebody else?
b	Uh huh.
 b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
 qy	Didn't they have an outside consultant, too?
qy	Did they have an outside consultant, like the employ ,
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
bh	really?
sd	and our organization builds those facilities over in Park Central now.
sd	He was very thankful for that, too.
sd	he thought he had a Ph D in how to get a job after he was, through the whole process, for several months.
sd	He did eventually get a job.
sv	And I guess it may be one of the best, that anyone's doing.
qo	What do you think about pensions?
b	Yeah.
sd	I've been thinking about that for years,
sd@	say you work for two, three companies, you take your pension with you after you're vested. And then just add the money together like you do with a four O one account, you know.
 sd	That's your account to roll over.
sd	So you work for a company seven years,
sv	it's there.
sd	That's just a thought.
b	Yeah.
sv	But I, I can see where they'd need to do something on that because the statistics are,
sd	a lot of people I know, guys,
sv	It would be nice if they could get them together.
 sd	I haven't used it for anything major.
sd	I'm glad it's there, though.
b	Yeah.
sd	and every time I needed it, it, it's, you know, fallen right in line for the, minor things
 sd	I guess I'm the one just supporting most of the others.
sd	but the dental is right away, if you,
sd	the medical you have to have a deductible.
sd	they just raised it to twelve.
sd	The forms are right in personnel.
sd	It's through Baxter Labs.
qy	do you buy your pills one at a time?
sv	but it's a lot cheaper,
sd	I take two.
sd	and maybe, maybe I'll tell you something you didn't know about in benefits .
sv	you know, it's a very common thing.
sd	It's through Baxter Labs,
fw	Yeah.
sv^t	I'm sure we're getting close to our five minutes whatever, here.
qw	What other benefits,
sd	but again a hope I never use that one.
sv	That means you're really sick if you have to use that one.
sd	so I'll get another week when I hit fifteen.
sd	I know some people who have twenty five years and thirty and they want more
b	Uh huh.
sv	And none of it has been good .
sd	the ones that can afford to have live in nannies, They seem to be having an okay time.
sv	I'd say fifty percent of, you know, my peers in my circle of friends have tried it and then stopped working until they're, you know, going to get their children in kindergarten or first grade.
sv	there must be some good service out there if you really look and pay for it.
qy^d	In terms of what they're talking about.
sd	Infant. ...
b^r	Infant.
sd	So, we're just going through the process.
qy	Do you have children?
qrr	or is he older now or younger
sd	So he's out of daycare .
b	uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	that's wonderful.
b	Yeah.
sd	But I've done free lance writing in the past,
sd	I've always been in a corporate, environment.
sv	So, I think that's th , something that couples need in going into this.
qw	What part of the country are you in?
sd^m	You're in Maryland.
sd	That's what I'm hoping.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qy^d	From a mother's standpoint, I mean in a way, it was quote and unquote good objectivity.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean, you're far enough away now I can tell you since this is locally, I make sure, we're going to Romania in a few weeks.
 %	And that's, just .
sd	R , Romania.
sd	As in, like, what Twenty Twenty and, but we're real excited because we've just developed a contact. Through professional people
sd	we're just very excited .
sv	When you deal with issues like that, in terms of family building through adoption, and then you have people responding to you, well if you go through that why would you put them in daycare.
sd	I feel that if the child is healthy, and as long as we make it feel secure, I'd love to do something like with what you did.
sd	I don't think I could be dumper where I could take it from, you know, eight in the morning till nine at night or six at night and leave it there.
h	I don't know.
qw	what country were you, in Europe when you were
sv	it just seems the United States does not provide for either child care or elder care, as I call it.
sv	and we're just not set up for that.
ad	Go ahead.
ba	See, I think that's wonderful.
b	Right.
sd	I'm that way.
sv	and I agree with that.
sd	It's amazing to me how forthcoming people are with their opinions and thoughts .
sd	But I've been at companies where, you know, the, the trend is, or the definite mood is, well we made conscious decisions not to have children.
sd	and, I respect, there are some women that I know that are divorced or on their own or in single parenting and men that you know, they may have the need for child care like that.
ba	But I agree with you, that it's just, I call it dumping .
b	Uh huh.
sv	it's in tandem then.
sv	One of the things that is a problem is in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers.
sd	And some people that are not making more than twenty thousand a year ...
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	yeah.
sd	and she's at home part time paralegal.
qy	is child care or that type of idea completely foreign to them?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I was wondering about that.
sd	and there were enlightening things that broke some of my stereotypical thoughts.
qy^d	but, I was just real curious when you said Middle East, if you didn't mind me asking.
sd	Well, even if you did, that's okay actually.
ny	Yes.
b	Okay.
qy	is that good?
sd	but, I like it's okay.
b	Uh huh.
bd	That's okay.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that sounds really good.
b	Yeah.
qy	Well are there just the two of you?
sd	well, when my husband and I go out we have four children.
sd	the fast food ones are probably the ones they like the best.
sd	so we like to go to a pizza place where you can buy a pizza for one price and feed the whole family, and like that.
sd	and we usually head on down, what's the freeway down here?
ny	Yeah.
sd	but one of our favorites is Pappasito's.
sd	we love to go there.
sd	You know it always kills me cause I don't like the decorations so much
b	Yeah
sd	But I love the food,
sv	the food is great.
ny	uh huh.
sd	it's a shrimp dish,
sd	and I don't remember the name of it,
sd	and it's really good.
ba	they are really good.
b^r	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	it's very expensive.
b	Yeah
qy^t	Sometimes it's hard isn't it to keep a,
sd	sometimes Mark and I, that's my husband Mark, go to the August Moon which is down there
sd	it's a Chinese, restaurant with the lions in the front,
sv^e	and, it's pretty good as far as Chinese,
sd	but Chinese isn't my favorite
sd	I like that.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Is it?
ba	how nice.
b	Yeah.
qy	Was it?
qy^g	That's what we need isn't it?
sd	now, I like barbecue okay, Texas barbecue.
sd	It's good.
sd	now, they're real good.
sd	They are good.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
sv	Just to die for exactly.
b	Oh.
^2	In heaven .
 sd	I just had a baby,
 %	So, they're kind of,
sd	my littlest girl she's still like wants McDonald's, McDonald's, McDonald's .
ba	I'm telling you.
sd	Well, it's kind of funny is sometimes like we all want different things,
sd	and so there's a H Avenue down here, and along are these fast food restaurants .
sd	and then we go to park over there so we can all have our own.
sd	that's on the nights we can't decide.
sd	Well, five of them, they're good, kids.
ba	how nice.
 ba	It will be neat.
b	Yeah.
b^r	yeah.
sd	You have to be careful if you go to a restaurant that, that really is more adults you know,
 sd	like we could probably take our oldest son and, and our oldest daughter.
sd	And they know how to act,
 sv	and some restaurants are really trying to go for that atmosphere kind of thing.
 b	Yeah.
 b	Yeah.
sd	and I can't think of it.
ba	dear.
sv	It was one of these you have bad experience and, say I don't think I'll come back here.
b	Oh.
 b	Oh.
 b^r	yeah.
sd	and I can't really think of any other, places.
ba	that's true.
ba	there you go.
sd	maybe.
fc	Bye bye.
ad	do you want to start out?
qy	are you really?
qy	Are you strict vegetarians?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 sv	There's very few places I'll bet that you could,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qw	How long have you been doing this?
qy	Do you feel that it has improved the way you feel?
bh	Do you think?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I always thought it would be hard to figure what to eat if you were a vegetarian.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
^2	Because you don't eat any of those things.
bh	Is that right?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	we throw more of it off our bod , out, in other words.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's interesting.
b	Uh huh.
^2	After you have been on this.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
bf	He thinks more about them, then.
 b	Uh huh.
sv	So you kind of have a combination.
sd	Well see, I live in a farming community. So, of course we have a lot of animals and that type of thing raised in our area.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	So you would have a little more trouble when you were looking for a dining area than what most most people would.
sd	Now we wouldn't have that problem, because we're not vegetarians.
sd	I think the main thing that I look for is, cleanliness, you know, in the appearance of the people that work there.
 +	And the, quality of the food that they serve.
sd	a lot of times we do eat where we know.
sv	because a lot of them are the same no matter where you stop.
sd	I like to sit down and have my, order taken.
sv	well I don't know whether it's age or what it is.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	You should have a treat.
sd	Not all restaurants have light meals on their menu, you know.
 %	And I,
sd	L I T E, like, things that aren't as heavy a meal.
sd	and they're not,
sd	but it's not all rest,
b	Uh huh.
 ba	I know
aa	yes.
sd	But they have so much food that not matter how hard you try to restrain yourself, you end up eating much more than you need.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	You can eat as much as you want and you like the food, you know.
sv	like, Haas's carry a bread bar that is just out of this world .
sd	And I eat it because it's so good.
b	Yeah
 sd	I don't like to, you know, go to anything that's real expensive.
sd	I think that's a waste of my money.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you?
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Chinese?
sd	We've got a good Chinese restaurant in town.
 sd	you're satisfied,
 sd	but you don't feel stuffed and miserable.
 b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh
sd	Well, you're just a youngster then .
 sd	I passed the fifty.
 sv^t	so it should be real interesting.
qy	So, you think we're ready?
ad	you want to start off?
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think all things get started sometimes in that manner.
sv	You know, they come in that way.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	but that is true.
sv	Some of them.
b	No.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	they hurt themselves a little bit in that way.
b	Uh huh.
ba	There's a lot of truth in that.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba@	That's right. Uh huh.
sv	it shouldn't be destroyed.
b^r	yeah.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, that's kind of makes it exciting. You know.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think now when both are working they have a more of a chance of working together because they're starting out that way.
b	Yeah.
sv	and it's, really hard to really to get help. you know to get the work load shared.
ny	uh huh.
sd	they're , They're all grown and on their own
qo	how do you mean that? .
sd	and our, our baby girl just had a baby girl .
sd	Last week was her first baby.
ba	So it's been real exciting.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Have you been that way long?
b^m	Just eight years.
sv	that's a long eight years, though.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	and the way you are also has changed, though. You know, compared to what it would have been twenty, fifty years ago.
b	Uh huh.
b^m	The best you can, yeah.
sv	I think that's being damaged, a lot.
sv	They're very capable of working
aa	it really is, yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	So many have to work to make a go of it, it seems,
sv	it's not as much of a stigma not to work as it was for a while there.
ba	Well, that could be.
b	Yeah.
ba	Much stronger.
b	Right.
b^r	yeah.
ba	Yes.
b^r	yeah.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	But they're both,
sv	That's,
 +	That's where the trouble lies.
sv	and others can't.
sd	She has two little boys.
 sd	But then, it's real hard because she's got an excellent job.
qy	Well, do you watch much T V?
qw	How many kids do you have?
sd	That is about all I want .
sd	They are still babies.
sd	We do not have cable.
sv	Now SESAME STREET is a good program because,
sd	And he has learned to count to twenty from that.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
b	Right.
sv	But they also have a lot easier time disciplining their kids than real people do.
b	Yeah.
sd	I love QUANTUM LEAP.
b@	yes. That is a good show.
b	Uh huh.
sv	He always got to change history is what it is.
sd	I was glad when they put that back on this channel,
 +	because like I said, we only get two channels because we do not get cable.
sd	I do not like him sitting in front of the T V all day.
sd	And I will let him watch the T V when I am wanting to get my house work done.
sd	But other than that, I do not like him glued to the T V all the time.
b	Huh uh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I do not let him watch it anymore. Because the pieces, like especially where they kill somebody, it is just not good.
sv	I mean it is just real violent.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
sd	they would just fall down.
 b	Yeah.
sv	They try to make it too realistic.
 %	And,
sd	Now he is watching HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS right now.
sv	it is cute.
 %	And that,
sd	little ROGER RABBIT on before that.
sd	And they have got THE HE MAN, MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE, the movie.
sv	That is a real cute show.
qy^d	HE MAN?
sd	good versus evil.
sv	well, it sounds like we have the same tapes for our kids anyway.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	They do have like those parental control things on the, remote controls. You know, where you can block out what channels you do not want them to watch.
ny	Uh huh.
 sd	Well, my, stepfather and them have, my stepfather, my father in law, and them have that.
sd	But still, when the kids get older, they learn how to break through that parental control.
sv	I think alls you have to do is push a couple buttons.
sd	So, it is, I am hoping that he will grow up not really caring much for those movies because, now we have got a lot of western tapes.
sd	JOSEY WELLS, now he loves to watch JOSEY WELLS.
b	Yeah,
 sd	Clint Eastwood.
sv	Now STAR TREK is good movies, good shows.
sd	We have got a lot of those.
qy^d	THE NEXT GENERATION?
sd	My little boy is crazy about Captain Kirk.
sd	And my little girl has Mister Spock's ears .
 sd	I told my husband he cursed my kids.
sd	My little boy grew out of it.
aa	No.
qy^d	Kirk Douglas?
sd	Michael Landon.
qy^d	Like HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN?
sd	she is about the same age as I am.
sd	I wanted to be just like her, because she is so cute.
sd	I liked it,
 sd	that is about the only, show I have seen where every time they sit down at the table, they pray before they eat.
sd	And I thought that was real neat. Because there is not a lot of shows that do that.
sd	And, they have this little cartoon that is on Sunday mornings with, Jot.
sd	They have it like before one of the church things, you know, church that comes on?
sd	and the parents will tell him that there is a verse in the Bible that will help him with that,
sd	usually we go to church on Sundays.
sv	it is funny.
qy^d	You are in Plano?
sd	it is twelve or ten down here.
sd	well, this is of the mornings.
sd	I think it is before the First Baptist in Sherman airs.
sv	I think that is the one that it, comes on before.
sd	I am trying to get my little boy into reading, like church books and things.
sd	We have got about eight or twelve books for him, just little Bible stories.
sd	he is getting to where he likes them.
sd	He likes it .
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	So it's a, a Christian songs?
sv	that sounds fun.
ba	That's something.
b	Yeah.
sd	and I'm up in Wisconsin
sd	my name is Terry
sd	but, we're not that far from the city where there's tons of pollution.
ad	I'll go ahead and start recording that,
sv	and, I'm sure there's a lot of pollution.
sd	before moving to Wisconsin lived across from where they were, gravel pits and also where they were making tar,
sd	and so we occasionally if the wind was blowing the right direction would get the smell of tar
sd	so and it was like miles away,
sv	but just the idea of having that come across the way it did in the wind kind of made you know that there was a lot of pollution,
sd	but where we also lived, too, it was very close to a highway,
sd	so got a lot of fumes from, trucks and cars
sd	I mean, it was on your tables,
sd	I mean, it wasn't the typical dust that you get way out in the country 
sd	and that's all it needs versus every day when I lived in the city
sd	it comes right on through through the screens,
sv	the only way that you could actually live in the city is to close your windows and have an air cleaner system right in your home that would take the air from the outside and clean the air before it would get into the house
sv	if you were well protected by trees, which catch a lot of the pollution then you're fine,
sv	and it's just going for miles and miles and miles,
sv	and it's landing somewhere with the wind,
b	Sure.
b	Sure.
b^r	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I mean, our air quality, in the Twin Cities is a lot better than what we've heard about California and maybe in the other areas,
sv	and it's kind of scary because the air is something we take for granted
sd	even my husband was, talking to some of the guys at work,
^q	it wouldn't pay
sv	it would save quite a bit on the wear and tear on cars and, you know, the gas,
sv	at least it's with one person
^q	it's too much involvement
sv	and you kind of say to yourself, what kind of future will they have when they think back and say, well, my parents did have the choice to kind of make a difference
sv	but they have to change attitudes,
b	Sure.
b	Sure.
nn	no.
sd^e	My father came in right after World War two.
na	I am too young, yeah.
ny	yes.
sd	A couple.
sd	he was a lineman down there.
sd	And while he was there, he caught some kind of a strange disease.
sd	and he had like a hundred and five fever for a while
sv	I do not think he was in combat,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
 sd	But he was in the Navy, though,
 +	he was .
sd	It makes a lot of difference.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
sv	they did so much to their own people all during that time.
sv	You know, and they take a, even now, they take a free hand as far as medicine and, you know, how they treat the war casualties, you know.
sv	If you come back and your leg is blown off, you know, or it is hanging by a thread, they still can't put it back together now.
sv	But, But what they do afterwards and how they rehabilitate you.
b	Yeah.
 +	it's about nine or ten percent now.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's true .
b	No.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	there are still people trying to get some member of their family back from, Vietnam.
sd	native Vietnamese people.
aa	Yeah.
sd	and they never did get back
b	Yeah.
sd	It spilled over into, now I can't even think of the country.
sd^m@	Cambodia. And to Laos,
sv	and, and all they did is run and hide.
sv	it would have been the same as Desert Storm if all they had been fighting was North Vietnam.
sv	But, and I am not even sure who was involved more. Whether it was China or Russia.
sv	You know, they were pouring weapons in there and well, digging tunnels for them. You know,
sv	and there is no way that they could ever catch them.
b	that is right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and then they try to camouflage the top.
sd	he dug a bunch of moats and filled them with oil
sd	And you know, they had to blow them up or, or disarm them.
sd	And then they had to fill in little bridges all the way where he had made those moats.
sd^e	partially.
bf	Part of it is technology, yeah.
ad	go ahead.
b	Yeah.
sv	Because
 sv	and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him, you know.
sv	He probably just went right down into a tunnel.
ba	That is right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	You stand there with a rifle and blow a piece of somebody apart, or blow their head off,
sv	and that has to affect you if you are human, you know.
sv	So they had to work all that anger out, and the nightmares that come along with it.
sv	I do not, I do not really think that anybody can ever forget that,
sv	but they can reason and, and try to adjust to why they were there.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	And he did not want to be in it any more than what we started out in August with Desert Storm.
sv	And then it just blew up into the war.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right, yeah.
b	Uh huh
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
ba	Exactly.
sv	More than, what was, APOCALYPSE NOW .
sv	I think so.
fc^m	it was nice talking to you.
fc	bye bye.
qy	do you do garden work?
b	Uh huh.
qw	Where's that?
bk	okay.
qy	Well, you know, do you do gardening at home?
ba	my goodness.
sv	well I guess you glad you got to go to college so you'd get some rest
sd	We lived in the country for a long time,
sd	I have a few flowers, but most of mine are like in barrels and things like that.
 sd	I don't like to have to have to pull grass
sd	so I decided that I would plant me a tomato plant in a flower pot and see how it worked.
sv;sd	And mine looks real good .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd	and I tried to talk my husband into just buying a whole bunch of pots . And planting them all in it, you know, because that's favorite thing, is tomatoes to grow.
sd	because he's always had a garden out in the country.
qy	you know what day lilies are?
sd^r	Day lilies.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	a, well, they really look like an orchid when they come out.
sd	but they only bloom for one day.
sd	It only blooms for one day.
 ny	Uh huh.
sd	and I have purple ones
sd	and then they have like, you know, the real velvety looking stuff inside
sd	That's what they look like.
sd	and she had belonged to this kind of society that like every year, you know, or every so many months they would send you different bulbs that they came out with.
sd	the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was like thirty two fifty for one bulb.
 sd	So the next year when she, you know, weeded them out
 sd(^q)	I said, Yes, we may leave that.
^q	I think we will leave that.
 sd	my kids, when they were little they had given me some azaleas so I brought all my azalea bushes.
sd	And you know, I brought as much as I could bring
sd	if I left like one bulb of each one of them, by this year they'd have ten bulbs of each one of them.
 sd	it would cover it right up.
sd	But, I just couldn't see it, you know, going off and leaving everything like that.
sd	I don't do any of the mowing or, you know, edging and all that
sd	But that's because I'm allergic to the grass.
b	Really.
sd	because then it doesn't make me ill .
sd	And it's not as bad as it was when we were out in the country.
sd	if I went outside while he was mowing the grass, I was going to have a gigantic attack.
sd	That helps a whole bunch.
 sd	I mean, that's really nice.
sd	Well, the first thing we always plant is tomatoes
sd	And then we plant cucumbers
ny	yeah.
b	Really,
 sd	It must be the,
sd	Now I mean, that's something that grows like a weed here.
 sd	We have to allow extra room for those, you know, I mean extra space, between the rows and all.
sd@	if we plant, for every one plant we probably get fifty to sixty cucumbers off of it. I mean, just pulling them as fast as you can.
sd	We usually give them to everybody.
 sd	But we tried it, too, where you run it up a fence
sd	I mean like the little thing would be half on one side and half on the other.
sd	But, I mean, cucumbers here grow like crazy.
sd	Of course it's real hot here too.
qy	Have you ever had them just come up in different places?
sd	well, the first year after I mean, we planted them,
 sd	but the first year, you know, after we'd had a crop all these little things like,
sd	and I thought, how did this get here
sd	And it was weird, but the birds had, you know, evidently just deposited them for us.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you have any?
sd	I have one,
sd	and when I'm home, you know I'm either cooking or running doing, things or, laundry or stuff.
sd	And I hate when the phone rings and it turns out to be a telephone salesman.
sd	number one, I really feel that that's you know, my own home.
sd	and if I want something, I will get it.
sd	And I never buy anything from a telephone, salesperson.
sd	So, I really feel they're invading my time and my space
sd	it really bothers me.
sv	it's a little bit like junk mail except you can't, you know, ignore it, quite as easily.
sd	but at the same point,
sd	and then I hang up before they can say anything.
sv^e	and it works very well .
sd	but I just feel that's my thing on invasion of privacy.
sd	I wish that there were a way that you could, you know, submit your telephone number to the phone company and have a penalty for anyone who calls you to sell things, from a busi ,
sd	I mean you can't do it for any compan ,
sd	that company is not allowed to sent you any junk mail.
sd	If you get junk mail on a regular basis from any particular company you can,
sd	you have to go to the post office and ask them for the form that you fill out not to get, you know, junk mail from specific companies.
sd	And I wish there were something like that where you can call the telephone company
 sd	And then anyone making these calls have to check that registry for that area should, and is not allowed under penalty of, you know, being reported or something to call you.
sd	So that would be one way of doing it.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I wasn't going to be available to be called back.
sd	and, I'll call later, if I'm available.
sd	The other thing that there is recourse to and that's another thing, is when you use your credit card and then they ask for a telephone number.
sd	you do not have to give a telephone number.
sd	And I don't really like announcing in public
sd	my telephone and I don't like the way telephone numbers can be used.
sd	And, we weren't actually able to trace it, but we were able to discard the charges.
sd	but it was,
sd	It was the charge card and social security number.
sd	sometimes I charge theater tickets over the phone.
sd	and that was because I initiated it.
sd	and occasionally I do order things from catalogs over the phone.
 sd	that's a law that went into effect, I don't know a year or two ago.
sd	a lot of stores will still ask.
sd	the credit cards company's responsibility.
sd^t	well, this is limited to the privacy issue, the invasion of privacy.
sv	I guess that just comes with the territory with a family that
qy^d	any experiences you've had at work?
sd	So many things I think over the years have been, accepted, I mean that are no longer done.
sv	Well, I mean, that's none of their business.
sd	but of course, now by law they can't ask that.
sv	So I mean there has been I think a lot done to protect privacy.
qo	How do you feel,
b	Yeah.
 qy@	Do you feel that drug testing is an invasion of privacy? Or AIDS testing?
ny	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I sometimes feel you know, sometimes individual rights including the right to privacy have to be sacrificed for a greater benefit.
sv	I mean I do want my pilot to be sober .
b^r	yeah.
qy	Do you have a personal computer?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I work with them at Kelly Services, doing, data entry.
 qo	what do you think about them?
 %	or,
 b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	And you really have to be able to type pretty fast you know, before it really saves time.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
b	Uh huh.
^2	To set up the boundaries correctly, and how many lines you're going to use in an,
qh	can't you put, Can't you put it on a disk and then just edit it, if you need to when you go back.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
^2	Rewrite the whole thing.
qy	Do you end up with very different length lines?
qy^d	And it divides the words by itself?
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
bf	They space it out in the line itself.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qrr	or it's just that they don't use the materials that are available to them.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's better to learn it directly from the manual.
sv	Especially when you have to trouble shoot some things.
sd	and you have to work around it.
qy^d	Have you worked mostly on I B M,
sd	that's a , that's all I've seen in offices, is I B M.
qy^t	Well do you think it's been five minutes yet
fc	Well it was nice talking to you.
fc	Thank you.
qy	are you a T I er?
b	really.
ny	yeah.
qrr	or have you been participating in this?
sd	well you've passed me up.
sd	This is about six times.
b	Yeah.
sd	And I think it was tremendously down.
ny	Yeah
sd	But I think that when I was at T I of course, we had all the information before they started.
sv	and then usually a lot of them partake in some of the benefits of rehabilitation and everything.
sd	I don't know what they were.
b	Yeah.
b	really.
sv	That would be terribly embarrassing for someone to really come back positive
sd	now I'm not in personnel or anything.
sv	It's got to be a highly qualified agency.
sd	but it wasn't even in Dallas, you know, the one that did us.
aa	Yeah.
sd	and they have an agency where you can go for personal problems, financial or whatever.
sd	and they won't say anything about it.
b	sure.
sd	You know the classical thing is to give it away.
sd	That's a real worry.
qy^d	you know a lot about that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and one's at home, gets dozen calls a night.
sd	she'll be on the phone all night.
qy	Do you have children?
ba	great,
sd	and I always say that I've learned so much more from them than I ever taught them.
sv	It's a fantastic experience.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Have our house as a place where they can come at any time, so that you always see their friends rather than make them not welcome
sd	So we've been lucky that our house is usually the place where the kids could come, you know.
sv	and you always have your house welcome, then your children think that, you know, you're cool parents and all that.
fo	Well good luck with your expected baby there.
sd	she reminded me to say that they're very cheap until they get to start driving.
sd	As they get older you know, they cost practically nothing from one to five,
sd	but it's well worth it and everything.
qy^c	You still there?
sd	You know, I don't have much to say about drug testing.
qy^t	Did you get the booklet on how to get the gifts and all?
sd^t	I just got it a week or so ago saying, you know, so many calls will be something a prize and everything.
qy^t	Was it five dollars a call?
sd^t	Well, hope they follow through and everything.
aa	yeah,
fc	Bye bye now.
qy^d	Hopefully you're a basketball fan.
qy^d^r	Hopefully you're a basketball fan.
sd^t	since we're supposed to talk about specific teams, I would like to see them turned back to where the college player plays for four years, and then, they're not semi pro and just go on and are stolen by the, the League, you know, in three years,
sd	plus I'd like to see them to be true athletes where they're taking a regular college course.
sd^t	they didn't ask that, but they're talking about college teams,
ad	you, if you like sports go right ahead with this one.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's good.
sd	I'm all for that.
ba	That's great.
b	Yeah.
sv	He only has twenty, twenty five, whatever hours he has to spend on practice.
sd	I mean, that's what I mean by semi pro.
sv	and I think they ought to get rid of that.
sd	I like that.
sd	I don't, I don't like the pros at all.
sd	and I don't really get much out of that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
 sv	but that's so much fun to watch because they're pure amateurs, you know, and there's no money involved.
sv	it loses it somewhere.
sv	these players, let's face it, ninety percent are being paid.
sv	I don't think that college football, or basketball, should have to be semi pro, you know.
sd	everybody should play, you know.
sd	Well again, I'd just like to see the true student athlete, play basketball, you know.
sd	I don't like to see the ones that have no intention of going to class,
sd	and that's what I think is a lot of fun.
b	yeah.
sd	I don't know why the don't keep fencing and all that, you know.
sd	I thought it was so that you give them an education of that particular discipline.
sd	I don't know what it was.
qh	Is that all they're going to have to make money, you know.
sv	But it seems like it is.
qy	You went to Indiana University?
b	okay.
ba	Well, good.
 qy	you're a T I er up in Sherman?
bk	very good.
sd^e	I'm in the facilities there, down here in Dallas.
sd	and there's absolutely no money involved whatsoever,
sv	and you know they're going to class, you know.
nn	Huh uh.
sd	I never been in a football game in high school that had that many.
sv	of, pro anyway.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
^h	can't think of the other one.
br	Pardon me?
sd	so, they benefitted tremendously by leaving the Mavericks.
sv	he never quite achieved you know, the super stardom that he had in college,
qw	what do you read?
qw	What is your favorite?
sd	I will get ideas out for my own house and yard and stuff .
sd	I love Pierce Anthony novels.
qy	Figures . What, like those, magazines you get through the mail?
sd	And stuff like that.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd	I like far out facts or whatever.
sd	But I am a superficial buff.
sd	Superficial,
sd	I do not get too into it.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
^2	Because you read it .
qy	Are you an engineer for T I?
sd	I worked at T I for a little while.
 sd	we have got a book that says, HOW DO THEY DO THAT?
sv	And it answers everything.
sd	but a lot of silly little questions.
sd	Like what makes a firefly light, you know .
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	she was not fully blind, just legally blind.
sd	and that is the best book to go through, those NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC.
sd	I love reading about animals.
sd	The gorillas and stuff.
sd	That's something moves that slow .
sv	And it is just weird.
sv^t	Well, we can talk about anything we want.
sd	But like I said, I do not keep up on all that.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	With everything going down?
sd	I know I heard Bush say that, you know, we are either bottoming out or seem to be.
sv	But that is Bush saying that .
sd	Well, I like Ann Landers .
sd	I do not go into the details.
qy^g	Well, I know at T I they have most of the stuff on the printout, don't they? I mean, on the computer where you can read the daily news?
b	Uh huh.
sd@	When I worked at T I, I read that more than I read the regular newspaper. Because I would read that every day because you would find ten minutes here that you do not have anything to do.
sv	I know you do, being an engineer.
sv	There are some times when you have got ten or fifteen or even an hour off .
sd	We had an engineer in there every ten minutes.
sd	Well, it just encouraged me to read it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd@	Well, see that is me with the newspaper. Especially financial page.
sd	and he is tycoon or something.
qw	What is his name?
sd	I still do not know what the whole deal was with that.
b	Oh .
qy	He was just having an affair on his wife?
sv	That has got to be hard to go from really rich to poor. Which I am sure he ain't poor.
b	Yeah.
sd	But I have got three kids .
sd@	So it is hard to watch T V. Except for Donald Duck.
fc	And have a good holiday.
qy	Are you in the market for a car recently?
qw	what did you get?
qw	what convinced you to get that one?
qw	how many miles on it?
sd	And it's still running real well.
 sd	I have, my husband and myself and we have two sons who are drivers one of which is an eighty eight Plymouth Voyager Van,
sd	about a year ago, we picked up a second hand, Audi
sd	I mean he was out of the hospital by that night, but the car was completely totalled
sd	I guess right now my criteria for cars is, being solid, able to take an impact
 sd	and, so, we're not going to be in the market in the near future for any new car.
sd	Another thing I'd definitely want would be anti lock brakes.
 qy	do you have any particular things that are priorities on your list.
qy^g	I guess down here air conditioning's a must, isn't it.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's incredible.
sd	It's a powerful car. but it does not,
sd	It comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving
sd	power windows are nice, but I don't need them . Although I must say when you're driving in the east and there are all these toll roads, come into a toll road, you just push that button down,
sd	it's real nice for that window to zip down and zip up, instead of having to crank it.
 sd	if you're alone in the car just to press buttons, and.
sd	one of the things that we've liked when we gotten a new car, and this used car has it, is a sun roof
sv	and those are really nice in good weather.
sd	I'd love to get an air bag and a sun roof, just so it'd be a good solid car.
sv	and they, make the car more expensive, but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong.
 qw	So, if you were to buy a brand new car, what would you look for?
sd	the Audi's German, and I have to say, it has been pretty dependable.
sv	sometimes, one advantage of an American made car, is if you get stuck anywhere, most local garages can fix you up.
sv	But once you get something fancy, you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really,
sd	and I know the Audi parts are terribly expensive.
sv	You know, we certainly have the technology,
sd	I mean, everything is more solid in it.
 sv	you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic
sv	I don't think I have to give up as much as I'm giving up.
qy	But, do you need air conditioning down there?
b	Yeah.
sd	we've had eleven days in a row over ninety.
fc	and enjoy your car.
fc	it's going to be a hot one.
fc	bye bye
sd^t	and what do you see coming in the future.
sv	Sounds good.
ad	hold on.
qy	Are you there?
ad	hold on.
o	Okay,
sd^e	I'm twenty three.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 b	uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
 sv	I know that, in the early seventies, I think women were the first people to make a move as far as individuals.
 sv	before that a lot of people that wanted to protest were large groups like, black people, or, you know, just large, large groups of people,
b	Right,
sv	and you had gay movements, and just the smaller groups of people.
sv	And I think since then is when a lot of the women's roles have started to change.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
 sv	I think that, you know, you can just look at home life and see, I've been talking to a lot of people about education and things, and what, what affects the school system
sv	and I think that a big thing that effects it is that the mother is not home anymore, like she used to be.
sv	She used to be kind of a, a rock, you know, in the house,
sd	And, since everyone is going out and working now, whether it be because of finances or just the economy,
 sv	but I think that, society's really going to have to get used to it.
sv	And they're not quite used to it yet
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd^t	Speaking of getting married, I was talking to someone yesterday on this, on the project,
sd	and I said no, I'm just twenty,
sd	and I said no, I'm just twenty three, you know, because I don't think of myself as needing to have children
 sd	my mind just went,
 sd	because it really didn't, doesn't even occur to me right now to have children,
sd	I think that I'll probably have children when I'm about thirty, thirty five, something like, just because, I'm not sure if it's just me, or women in general that are twenty three right now, because, I'm really into my career.
sd	I'm trying to go somewhere, and, and get there quick and then worry about, you know, because right now, in my career I'm really starting out,
sd	and it's going to take me a while to move up.
sd	And I don't need anything kind of holding me back,
 b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b^r	right.
 b	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah,
sv	it's just really not there anymore.
sv	And that has to do with, you know, the women getting out and other women seeing other women, you know, out in the corporate world.
 sd	She's, she's about forty.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
sd	I just turned twenty three, April twentieth,
sd	because me, myself, I just like to move really, really quickly.
sd	I'm, you know, I'm working quick.
sd	I want to retire quick.
 sd	i , when the age creeps up, where I'm twenty three and twenty four,
 sd	but I'm actually very, very young.
 b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah.
b	Right.
ba	exactly.
ba	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
ny^r	yeah,
sv	I know, I'm probably feeling that way because everything's geared towards young. You know
sv	and whether I want to realize it or not, everything on television is young, young, young, young.
sv	and, y , everybody that's in the music business is starting out at fifteen.
sd	and I would really love to become, a professional singer,
sd	but I think I'm too old now,
sd	and I'm twenty three,
sd	because everyone I've seen coming up, they're fifteen. You know,
sd(^q)	and I, I really have to always tell myself, no, you're not, you're very young.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Right.
ba	very true.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I can do anything I want to do, anything.
sd	but, and I get so depressed not because I can't find a job, but because I can't figure out what I want to do.
sd(^q)	and I'm lucky though, because not a lot of people can sit there and go gee, I don't know what to do.
sv	not a lot of people,
sd	but it's depressing too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
sd	I'm a news reporter, now,
sd	and I've been looking for something exactly like that jus ,
b	okay .
sd^e	I went to U T at Austin.
sd	And I just happen to work at a Waco station, because you know.
sd	broadcast news, T V,
sv	Well, I don't know if there's going to be solutions to the U S budget.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but, I know that state has, cutback, raises for a year to help, the, state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition.
sd	State of Minnesota.
sv	I mean everybody's doing it so it isn't like, private business has had to do it
sv	so it might have to be something that they might consider doing that's got to be very short term.
sd	As for instance, I think you probably remember the military getting caught, with toilet seats that cost them four hundred, five hundred dollars.
sv	so. So it gives you a , idea that,
b^r	sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
sd	when you think about people, taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress.
sv	The rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that.
sv	And it's a real big crunch,
sv	but, during that time I'm sure there's hundreds of, thousands of people that are, spending money that does not belong to them.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
sd	I mean it gave people jobs
sv	but after that you know, they didn't want to do it anymore.
h	So I don't know.
fc	and have a good evening.
fc	thanks.
qy^t	do we just go ahead?
bk	Okay.
na^t	well, we're supposed to talk about vacations
sd	and probably the one I liked most was Hawaii .
ny	Yes.
sd	We went, six months after we were married.
sd	And we just went to, two islands.
 sd	We went to Oahu and Kauai.
^2	The big one.
b	Oh.
sv	It was.
sd	I enjoyed Kauai better, too.
sd	it was rainy .
sd	but, you know, we don't like to spend the money to go over there and sit on the beach anyway
bh	really?
bk	Oh.
b	Oh.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	You know, I've been to Nassau, too.
sd	I went on a cruise.
sd	and, to tell you the truth, I think I'd rather just go to the island.
sd	Well, I, got sick.
sd	I went with my sister just, a couple years ago
sd	it was a four day
sd	and we were both ready to get off the boat.
ny	Yeah.
bh	have you?
b	Oh.
b	I'll bet it is.
b	Oh.
qy	You haven't been to Spain?
b	Oh.
sd	I was born there.
ny	Yes .
sd	just ten months.
b	Yeah,
sd^e	and I would like to.
b	Huh.
bh	Would you?
sd	Now, now I don't know if I'd like to go there just from the the problems.
b^r	yeah.
ba	That would be nice.
sd^r	Yellowstone,
qy	Have you?
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
sd	now I'm just about, a half hour, north of Salt Lake.
sd	my husband works in Salt Lake,
sd	we're real close
sd	we like it.
sd	It is.
sd	Well, we kind of like it .
qy	Well, do you like to camp, those kind of trips?
qy	you like the motels?
bh	did you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Huh.
 sd	wow, I don't know what that was.
sd	I don't know .
b	yes.
sd	and in Texas that is where we camp basically.
sd	And, it was just a really nice place to camp.
sd	But Tyler, we sort of got spoiled with, I think.
sd	So I guess we just kind of came by it naturally .
qy	Do you have a large tent
b	Uh huh.
qw	And how many does it sleep, comfortably?
b	Right .
b	Yeah,
sd	That really gave us a lot more floor space and, so, you did not have to be constantly getting things off the floor in order to walk around
sd	A little more, luxurious, so to speak, but not much .
sd	and you did not have to be hauling things out of the trunk of you car,
qy	So, do you have plans for any other camping trips in the near future?
 b	Right.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
 b	yes.
qy	do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to?
qy	is it true that Caddo Lake is the only natural lake in the State of Texas?
sd	and I would love to see what it looks like .
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
ba	How interesting.
sd	And so, we thought we might take some weekend trips and maybe that would be a good place to go to and see what it looks like.
b^r	yeah.
sv	when the trees start blossoming out and everything it is really very pretty,
fc	So, well, I have enjoyed talking with you.
fc	Hope you get to those places you have talked about.
fc	thanks.
qy	so are you prepared to talk?
co^t	Let me push.
sd	I don't know of any other state, does not have a state income tax
sd	for instance, the local, sales tax is eight and a quarter percent.
qw	What do you have there?
qy	And you have state income tax also?
sv	I think eventually they're going to have to do it
qrr	or how do you feel about that?
b	really
b	uh huh.
b	Yes.
sd^e	we do have tax on clothes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I guess I didn't realize that.
sd	we don't have tax on groceries, for instance,
sd	It's the consumable food parts that, you know, we don't have to pay tax on.
sv	it's just eight and a quarter just seems like an awfully lot of tax on any sale, as far as I'm concerned,
sd	and she was saying as the years have gone on, there are fewer and fewer things that people can, take off of their income tax.
sd	And, you know, if you're not a home owner, or if you haven't sold property, or, have something major like that, it's hardly, you know it's just not much else you can do,
sd	and she said it's really taken the fun out of doing taxes for people for her, because she used to be real creative about helping them find ways of, you know, accumulating receipts.
sd	Can't do, really can't do it any more.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Where did you go to school?
sd	I'm a graduate student having gone back after many years.
sd	nevertheless, I am a student, and poor .
sv	I guess, as far as people like, our family, we can feel like sometimes we pay more than our share as middle class Americans with college age students, you know,
sv	I guess as you say, you just have to look around and decide that most of the other people that you know are paying about what you are,
sd	Because it seems like, they still come out okay
 +	you know.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it seems like, they must feel like they're paid for all of the years of experience or something, or just the title, sometimes 
sv	but I think that's a lot of luck and a lot of gambling, and not a whole lot of work .
 b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ba	Probably not.
sv	or what's left is not going to be worth anything you know, in terms of how, you can actually use it.
b	right.
sd	I mean, for a while there, not too long ago, they were saying that the whole system was going to be bankrupt you know, before very long, because so much was going out for programs it wa , that originally it was never intended to be used for. Or, you know, programs just weren't in existence
qy^d	but if you have talked about that in your classes, you know, in the last few years, I'm sure that you have heard,
sv	but, I guess, you know, you have to be sort of,
sv	you have to appreciate, yeah, what you do get for them sometimes
sd	I'd rather be able to control my money as much as I do with what's left over taxes than to live in, England or, some countries where so much of it is socialized that you don't see any of that money at all
 sv	and, so, you know, I guess it's all relative,
ba	That's exactly right.
ad^t	You want to go first? .
sv^t	like should the government make it universal or something like that.
qy^d	you would be in favor of it?
b^r	uh huh.
qy	Do they have options on you know, like choices of doctors and that type of thing?
b	Uh huh.
sv	and if you didn't have any choice you know, in who you go to,
sd	It took that long.
sv	I don't know how that program works, you know, if you can do that.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I guess that's primarily was one of my thoughts, you know, because, you know how government is .
sv	For them to have a choice on if they're in favor of it or not.
sv	it would.
b^r	uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	or they can choose one that their company has elected
sd	and that costs them less if they take the doctor that the company has selected.
ng	Well, only to the point that he could go to somebody at his own expense.
sd	He took the less expensive one of course.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	cause that's the first I've really known anybody that, you know, works for somebody that they had that option, you know, to make the choice of what kind of hospitalization they wanted to take.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	You really are,
sd	we live in a rural area up here.
qy	are you familiar with any of the area that all?
qw	Where? .
sd	But we live in Clarion County.
sd	we have a cousin that lives in Philadelphia,
ny^r	uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	So I suppose really our situation here is even different that it is in, you know, like more populated areas as far as, the doctors that are available .
sd	We've had some of the most outstanding doctors in our area for some of the different fields.
sd	So, we've been pretty fortunate.
b^r	yeah.
b^r	uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I still wish they could do more with the cancer situation, though.
sv@	I know they're making progress, but not like, that I would like to see, yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	and it doesn't seem to matter.
sv	Well, they say second hand smoke and that, is worse than smoking .
qh	so, what do you do, you know?
sd	so I haven't ever had that problem, as far as that goes.
sd	So I can't take any credit for not smoking even.
sv	it's a hard one to quit.
fc	and you have a good day.
fc	Right .
sv	what causes the most air pollution is probably the car
sv	and, whether or not, they'll ever get into like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed, train or something like that
sd	and that's what we're finding, here, where we're at, in Minneapolis area, is that people don't want to carpool that there are inconveniences to that,
sv	so it's kind of a thing where, I think the majority of the people do not carpool.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Exactly.
sv	or if somebody gets sick, and it's not the other person and they want to go home, and that one person's got the car then they're stuck,
sv	you're definitely right,
o@	so, * slash error Yes, / * slash error
sd	that happens quite a bit,
sd	other than that, I don't know,
b	Okay.
ad^t	we'll try to be real quick here.
qw^d^t	The other thing then is, because I don't know how long they want us to talk,
b^m	Five minutes, okay.
na	Minneapolis area,
sv	the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone and of course hay fever season
sv	but those are natural
sd	and they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if it's releasing any, lead into the air or other pollutants,
sd	and if that's the case, then you have to get your car fixed,
b	yeah,
b^r	sure,
aa	Exactly,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Sure.
sv	the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars, air conditioning, I'm sure over there it's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it
sv	but it's uncomfortable
sd	and, I don't know if there was something wrong with it, or his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that,
sd	and I was thinking how many other people
sv	because if you take it into a service station, they want to charge you forty dollars just for, freon, which only costs you about three dollars
sv(^q)	so I have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say, Hey, that's that's right there.
sd	I think it's like three or four dollars a can
sd	and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because I'm sure he breathed it
o@	and, * slash error Uh huh. / * slash error
sd	Mainly, if I'm really wanting an in depth thing I'll watch C N N.
sv	And I find it one of the best.
sd	And, otherwise it's just one of the regular, channels eight or five.
qw	And, where do you get yours?
b	Uh huh.
sd	and my husband, he reads it cover to cover.
h	and, I don't know
sd	and if I wanted to read, I wanted to read something light and relaxing and and, things like that
 sd	and it got so depressing .
sv	Seems like it wasn't anything but bad news .
sd	but I find that I do better with, remembering it and everything if I watch, the T V you know,
sv	and they kind of capsize it and everything
sv	and I think sometimes it's, you know maybe a little biased, you know
sv	and sometimes. you get the sensationalism as opposed to just pure facts.
o@	Yes. Yes. * should be two slash units You found some members of your church that had been murdered?
b^m	the same type of church.
b^r	uh huh.
 b^r	uh huh.
sd	or I didn't used to
sd	when my grandchildren have stayed over before and even maybe when our kids were younger one of the channels used to give brief inserts of news at a child's level.
sd	Like they brought down something that had happened like if there was something going on, in the war, they would bring it down to a child's level in words you know, that they could understand what was going on.
sd	The oldest one he's nine
sd	been a couple of years ago.
sd	Actually I even understood it better .
sd@	I have kind of a blas3e attitude about, news and news reporting which is not good, you know. / * typo in word 8
sv	Nobody should get that way about the news. And what's going on in the world.
sd	We like channel eight.
sv	It's the best.
b	Uh huh.
sd	channel nine watching it when the murders were in Killeen
 sd	They were having news coverage
sd^e	it was channel nine.
sd	And, you know they have that hour that nine to ten of an evening.
sv	and the difference in coverage was unbelievable.
sd	I can understand you know, why they're kind of behind.
qy	Did I say channel nine to begin with?
ar	No, chan , channel eleven I meant.
sd	I was thinking nine to ten.
sd	But channel eleven,
qy	do you have an opinion on that, on the U S R?
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Sure.
b	that happens.
sv	from what I've been hearing is the U S, S R has been, almost bankrupt for years
sv	But I don't think the U S would get involved with it because, there's too close of ties to where I think they understand that Gorbachev is trying to make a change, and that we cannot run them like we run the U S and that they have to make their own independent decision.
sv	I, I have no feelings that they would ever start a war with us because to them you know, it would totally destroy their whole country because our technology is far advanced from what theirs is at this current time.
sv	But if you get the Iraqis and Iran which will do it for the country for the pleasure of, you know, doing whatever, for their country, they'll do it.
b	Sure.
fc	and you have a good weekend.
fc	Bye now.
ad	Scott, let's, talk about advice that we can offer a parent where the child is going to go to a university
sd	I have three boys.
sd	And they're all quite young
qy	Do you have any kids?
sd	So I imagine you've gone through the experience yourself of selecting your college your own college.
qw	what do you use as a basis to determine which college or university you go to?
b	Uh huh.
bf	what you thought,
^2	Just the degree itself.
sd	Well, that's, that's good, because I did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work.
sd	I wanted to get a school that was small enough, that was personable that you didn't have a lecture, hall with about fifteen other students competing for the professor's attention
sd	and, but I felt that I got a pretty good, undergraduate,
sd	I went to Utah State University which is in Logan, Utah
sd	and well known at least there in the State of Utah and around the surrounding states and so forth.
sv	like you mentioned before, the name the college and university can give you and another reason why I chose that was the finances.
sd	I wanted to make sure that I would be able to afford it, that I wouldn't get through three years of the undergraduate work and have to leave.
sd	And, so I did a lot of talking with friends, with family with, counselors at high school, and also read some books on the subject at the library.
sd	And, it was kind of unusual because my two older brothers and I all went to three different universities, depending on what our choice was.
sd	and I felt very comfortable and good about that.
ng	I don't think so.
sd	the way that tuition is increasing, exponentially it's, it's kind of hard to set aside money and have that money grow at the same pace that the college tuition is increasing.
sv	And that your children can use the benefits of that university.
sd	So my parents stressed that we get excellent grades so that we apply and try for scholarships
sd	and, scholarships were very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education, because my parents couldn't.
sd	And what the scholarship could not supply I was able to work for and and save and, and get.
sd	and he's working to pay those off.
sv	and, the student loans are good options.
qo	what's been your voting experience?
qy	Well, do you feel like,
b	Yes.
sd	but, I have felt since I've been here that I haven't known what the issues were because it was a new community.
b	Uh huh.
aa	It does.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	No.
b	Uh huh.
b	No.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and, I also feel, especially in the presidential elections that, since we're back on the old system of electoral votes or that, and that your vote doesn't necessarily elect president.
b	Right
sv	and, I'm glad that that happened and everything
sd	but I haven't done that so far.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
b	Right.
o	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and I can't say that there's too much of that there.
sd	I know the bigger cities have problems with it.
h	I really don't know what we can do about it.
sv	Unless they start enforcing the,
sv	That's the only thing I can think of.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Yeah.
sd	I, I don't know what they're going to do with the problem because it just keeps getting worse and worse.
na	I'm a senior at Clarion University.
sv	Well, not only that, a lot of them's not even turned in.
qy	You know,
sd	but I can't say that I've heard of, you know, any significant amount.
sv	but then again like you don't know how many girls are reporting them or not.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	See, you see now I would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything.
sv	but I, I would say that's a bigger problem.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No, I don't either.
nn	No.
sv	and something's going to have to be done sooner
sd	I don't know what they can do.
fc	It was nice talking to you.
fc	Bye.
ad	you want to tell me first how you feel about the proposal,
b	Uh huh.
sd	The boys
sd	not the girls, the boys.
sv	but I did not think it would be good that they all do something like the Peace Corps because not all young people would have, what it takes to go like that because I think it takes a certain person to be able to do something like that,
sv	but there's a lot of other public service things that could be done.
b	Right.
b	yeah.
qw	why, why did they call it a proposal,
b	Uh huh.
sd	That's what I wondered.
sv	It'd be good character builder.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, people that have received sentences in jail, they have to go out and do public service activities which to me is good.
sv	Well, I think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like, you know, what what some of the other parts of the world are like or even other parts of the neighborhood some of the people, how they live
b	Uh huh.
sv	because that's one thing that's hard, with young people, you can't tell them how things are
sv	they have to see for themselves
sv	I don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done.
sv	Of course they've already gone through the period of time where they need more direction you know, their teenage years and that they really sometimes need a little better direction to go and something,
sv	course now Peace Corps, that couldn't be done of course, until they were done with school so, * should this be it's own slash unit?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Kind of an in between time.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but not all certainly would be geared to, even the Mormon boys that go out, not all of them go,
sv	I mean it's disaster if they don't go,
sv	but but some of them are not,
sv	they're just not made to do that type of thing
sv	and they just aren't able to do it.
qw	So, how do we fix the national budget?
nd	Well,
sv	The true source of the problem is, that we do spend too much,
sv	but also, that we don't take in enough.
sv	If more Americans were working and meaningful good paying labor, and paying taxes, and the tax structure was fair between the lowest and the highest income Americans, then we would have more money there to play with.
b	Right.
sv	but, in fact, in some cases that's what we ought to do.
sv	Not Reaganomics, thank you.
sd	what I was thinking more along the lines of is start going to space.
na	Well, at some point there will be enough jobs for most of the able bodied Americans.
sv	We also need to, assure that there's some work in the private sector.
sv	But I think we should also do something rather radical.
sd	Legalize marijuana.
br	What?
sv	I think it would reduce the amount of carry on drug use where people advance from one drug to another.
sv	I think most importantly it would give the federal government something new that they could tax.
sv	and really receive some revenues from.
 sv	if you look at prohibition historically, it's repeal helped the federal government a lot in tax revenues.
sv	Then I think once we put money back in the coffers of the federal government, and get the federal government to where there's money there again, we should reduce the amount of money,
sv	in some cases we do pay more, for welfare recipients to live then they can earn in the true minimum wage environment.
sv	And you can't deny people the right to supply their families better through whatever means.
sv	That's just sensible on their part.
sv^r	It's just sensible on their parts, to go after the, the greater amount of income.
sv	So, if you lower the amount they make and raise the amount of true minimum wage jobs, not those that are affected by the federal minimum wage, then more people will get off welfare.
sv	You know, give them a true incentive to want to work.
sv	And then don't start letting more outsiders in for a few years until we figure out exactly where we're at with unemployment.
sv	Reduce immigration, or eliminate it entirely for a few years, until we get our own house in order.
aa^r	absolutely.
sv	I think we ought to just tax them severely.
sv	It seems only fair.
sv	And I think really if we got all those that are able bodied into the work force reduced the amount going out for those purposes, created new jobs for that work force, there would be plenty of money.
sv	And then at that point, quit spending on space.
 sv	Force it all into the private sector.
sd	space was just a convenient place for me to go because that would put a lot of, a lot of
sd	Millspec and NASA work operates to the same demanding specifications,
sv	that would put a bunch of defense workers back to work.
qy	You know what causes that?
sv	the government specifications,
sv	sheets of paper for building a pair of B V D underwear for the federal government, is twenty two foot tall.
sd	If it was all on nine by elevens stacked one on top of another.
na	For making government issue underwear.
sv	To just understand those legal requirements and operate within the government guidelines, costs the company a huge amount of money.
sv	a huge amount of it is not the fault of the contractor.
sv	a huge amount of what you hear about the seventy five dollar hammers, and the nine hundred dollar toilet seats doesn't come from people in the industry,
sv	my job is government tooling specialist.
sv	I'm trying to think of his name and, what they put, him through in regards to,
sd^m	Thomas.
sd	So, I know that's my personal viewpoint of things.
sv	So, I don't know if it's done because we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for, you know, a real good purpose to help people that can't afford, health insurance, that kind of thing.
ba	sure.
b	Uh huh.
sv	when we have T V s and we have things that are kind of bombarded at us for, you know, immorality and this and this and this, that we can expect somebody to come off that's going to be totally clean . And come into government.
sv	I mean when somebody's corrupt and somebody's doing something, you know, it does hurt each individual of the society when you find out that somebody's done something or the overdraft policy or, you know, the other things that have occurred,
b	Uh huh.
sv	there's no secrets in the government. I don't think anymore.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
qo	what do you think about the war recently?
ny	Uh huh.
sd	just everything.
ny	yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	you couldn't become a political figure or president unless you had served in the war,
sv	you couldn't be a political figure if you were in Vietnam probably.
sv	And now, if you've served in Desert Storm you probably would be a good candidate.
 ba	E , exactly, exactly.
 %	yea ,
 sv	or good that it ended as soon as it did.
sv	and it seems like everything is raising, everything that can be, cigarettes, not that I smoke, but cigarettes, stamps,
sv	I mean it seems like ever ,
sv	everything single thing that we do, is higher,
sv	but that's not like, you know, as much as they should have raised it I'm sure.
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
sd	I work as a news reporter in Waco,
sd	I got to see probably a good part of the war, as far as what people thought about it, and a lot of things like that,
 sd	people were coming to me to ask me, you know, what's going on, you know, like I knew, or like I sat in on the meetings or something.
 sv	so that was pretty interesting.
 b	Yeah.
aa@	exactly. Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	Whereas it would have been,
aa	Exactly,
sv	The roles are changing a lot.
b	Right.
sd	because, you see that they have THE THREE MEN AND A BABY type movies.
sv	And I think, you know that,
 sd	and then you have the women, detectives now and, you know, different roles,
sv	so we probably want to do that even more now. You know since the women's movement in the, seventies,
 sv	and, you know, we've come a long way but I think it's still have a good ways to go.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
aa^r	Exactly.
 %	It's just not as,
sv	I mean like I say, we've come a long way, but we have, I mean, twice as far to go, still,
sv	and I don't think a lot of people, you know, realize the plight of a lot of people. You know, and you may be in good standing and everything may look hunky dory to you, but there's so many more people, exactly, * slash marks right? Should there be one after 'exactly'?
 ba	yeah.
 b	Yeah.
sd	I grew up in, in Brooklyn, New York,
 sd	and so I was just surrounded, you know, by Black people,
sd	and so, you know that's where I lived.
 sd	I went to U T to college,
 sd	and so you know, they have a lot of different people go there, different kinds of people.
 sd	And so I feel really enriched in that a lot of people don't get to see,
 sd	you know, some people have lived in Lewisville all their life, you know, and they don't get to see,
 ba	Exactly . And th ,
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Exactly.
aa	It is.
ba	my God.
sd	Well, there's so many people who have never, you know, even gotten to do that,
 sd	My sister was telling me she's going to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia,
sd	and, she just met a girl from, I think, Barbados or Jamaica, or something, like that.
sd	And I mean this girl she had like two outfits that she would just wear all the time, and everything
sd	and,
 sd	and,
 +	I just thought that was so very exciting, you know, to go and just witness, you know, this girl just coming to America type thing, you know. too.
sd	When I first moved here I was only thirteen but, everyone had a car in school, you know,
sd	I was from New York so, you know, we road the bus.
sd	you just didn't have a car,
sd	and I couldn't understand it.
sd	You know, all the kids had cars,
sd	and they, you know, have to have a car.
sd	So that was,
b	right.
sd	Or live really close to school and have them walk.
 sv	a lot of changes.
sd	I think so .
fc	well, it's good talking to you.
ad	Well, basically, did you want to go first, then?
b	right.
sd	it's just a typical home with, three bedrooms, two story type home.
sd	so it's, pretty much that, type of, home
bh	really?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	So it's the rambler style.
sv	It seems like they get incredibly small .
qy^d^t	The T I?
sd^e	about three times before.
sd^t	but it seems to be going okay.
nn	huh uh.
sd	I'm in Wisconsin,
ny^r	yeah.
qy^t	Is this your first time?
b	Uh huh.
sd^t	I don't have to wait until somebody calls me even though I have a feeling what's going to happen is I'll probably get tons of calls, you know, sooner or later.
b	Uh huh.
b	sure.
fc	Yeah.
fc	well, you take it easy, Gail.
 fc	Bye, now.
sd	but I go from classical all the way to, jazz and country and soft pop,
sd	and there isn't any particular music that I enjoy more than just listening to all kinds
sv	now, it's pretty neat music that they came out with,
o	you talk about twangy.
b	Yeah.
sv	the old, old country,
b	Yeah.
sd	Lately, you know, with the new music that has come out, some of the really good, music they have the saxophone playing,
sd	and it's so funny, because you can take an instrument and forget what it really sounds like when it plays by itself.
sd	my daughter just fell.
sd^e	a little bit.
sd	and she slipped.
sd	I can take all kinds of music pretty much except for when you get, like I said, into the real hard rock,
sv	let's just put it that way, hearing, anyway,
b	sure.
 fc	Okay.
 fc	You, too.
qo	well, what do you all do for camping?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Where do you go?
b	Oh. Uh huh.
qy^d	Around Gatlinburg, or somewhere up in there?
qy	and did it get real cold at night,
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but we'll stay in cabins. And, you know, call that going camping,
sd@	we drove up by Cosa Springs, Colorado. And went back seventeen miles back in the back where you couldn't even get a forest ranger if you tried to the tent for a week.
sd	You know, they were just right there.
sd	But about the fourth day, I thought, if I don't get a hot tub and shave my legs, I'm going to die .
sd	And I had I, I got enough of it right then.
sd	So, when we can go to a cabin as long as we've got running water I'm a little bit better off.
sd	I know that .
sd	I agree with him, too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And then once they're there they think it's kind of cool.
b	Yeah.
sd	Mom did the whole, pork and beans and, you know, the slice the potatoes and fry them outside and all the little stuff that we just were so amazed that she knew how to do .
sd	You know, couldn't believe,
^2	with bacon.
b	yeah.
sd	and daddy would always try to prove he could catch fish for breakfast
sd	One.
sd^r	One.
sd	Is that where you're hot, like on a beach,
sd	Because a lot of our friends will,
sd	and I'm thinking, how could you stand it, you know
ba	that's true.
sd	and see, especially in the tent every afternoon it would rain
sd	and you would get your book and just kind of cuddle up.
sd	And I thought that was fun.
b	Uh huh.
ba	no.
ba	no .
ba	Golly .
 %	Well,
sd	in fact, the more urban we get with the television and the cabin and the whole bit, it loses it's flavor.
sd	Well, I've gotten in the mood to go now .
b	Yeah
fc	Well, listen, I enjoyed talking with you.
fc	Have a good day.
qw	where are you from?
bk	okay
sd^t	I was just curious.
qy^t	Have you, too?
ad	Go, ahead,
ad	you first, Eve .
b	Food.
ba	great.
sd	It's fairly easy and fast.
sd	I guess I'm thinking of the easy thing to do for having, dinner.
sd	You know, the breakfasts and, and the steaks,
sd	Although I would like to experiment with, the meals my mother made, you know. So to speak,
sd	and I haven't gotten around to that yet,
sd	We were very poor.
sd	she would throw things together
sd	And my wife, of course, thinks I'm crazy, which I may be too
b	Yeah.
sv	But dinner parties are a lot of work,
b	Yeah.
sd	shish kabob is, just because it only takes a few minutes to cook, you know,
sv	But, so far as getting out there and putting it on, it only takes a few minutes,
 +	my guests, I guess,
b	Right.
b	yeah.
b	yeah.
^2	You'd get the odor of it, yeah.
b	yes.
ba	great.
sv	I guess it gets better and better as we remember it, back, as we get older, you know.
sv	But we probably should try it, to do that.
sv	and we'll probably forget all about them, you know.
sd	here I am talk about trying to make everything easy, you know.
 sd	And, we were going over to my mother's house for Christmas, you know, to have a meal.
sd(^q)	I said, We don't have turkey at Christmas .
sd(^q)	I said, We're going to have a ham.
sd(^q)	She said, What?
sd	And because she had turkey a lot, you know.
sd	we always had ham, you know.
sd	the cans were cooked for hours and hours and were just wonderful, you know.
sd	I'd like to try that too.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's good.
sd	My wife I think goes
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
b	Yeah.
sd@	I'll have to ask her about that. because we have a delivery guy that comes around, that sells,
sd	They have steaks and, and, actually, pirogies and all that stuff that,
sd	it was boneless
sd	We had it for breakfast a long time.
sv	It was really great.
b	Yeah.
sd	because I don't think in my married life, which is, twenty six years now, we've never done that, you know.
sd	And I remember that when I was a kid, to have the ham cooking. rather than that, we just,
sd	ham is just something you have for breakfast occasionally, you know.
sd	and I don't think we, really have it as a main meal.
qw	how have you changed your meals now?
qy^d	looking at those things?
sv	Parents, that's unusual.
b	yeah.
ba	That's amazing.
b	Yeah.
ba	Well, that's amazing,
sd	Usually it's the younger people doing it.
sd	 my wife's mother is the only grandparent left,
sd	and, she has high cholesterol.
sd	Of course, I have too, but not like hers.
sd	And she just will, I mean, she's going to eat the same way she ate, you know, her whole life.
sd	And she just tells, more or less tells me to shut up, you know.
sd	I'm trying to do something about my cholesterol in the same way.
sd	and, he talks about, you know, the chicken and the rice and everything else.
sd	And then he's got me into making eggs without the yolk.
ad	You know, try that sometime.
sd	But, when I make scrambled eggs now, talking about a recipe,
sd	but if I'm making four eggs, even for my daughter I'll take out all the yolks but one.
sd	In fact, when I make eggs for myself, if I fry them, throw them in there, I will almost hard fry them so I can not eat the yolk at all.
sd	You get like, a bite at the most.
sd	My cholesterol gone down twenty points.
sd	I don't know, whether any of that is true, you know . Whether the margarines or butter,
qy	Well, do you have any, television programs that you watch regularly?
b	Uh huh.
b	No.
b	Uh huh.
bh	you will?
bf	Relax.
sd	and sometimes I will watch, like the network evening news program.
sd	it comes on like at nine o'clock, at night
sd	I have seen that, MURPHY BROWN that comes on, Monday nights before
 sv	and it's kind of cute,
b	Uh huh.
b	but,
sd	I have seen it, I think, maybe once.
sd	My children like some of the morning children's shows, when they're home.
sd	It's just like a SESAME STREET,
sd	but I don't watch any daytime T V at all.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's nice.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and when the newspaper comes out on Sunday, I sometimes read through the movies that will be listed,
sd	and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because there's always plenty of things that we can record and then,
sd	and they have a couple of channels that are like nostalgic older movies, that I have really enjoyed that I'm seeing for the first time . Like the MARX BROTHERS and things like that.
sd	Some of the video rentals can be expensive
sd	and you can do it anytime you take the notion.
sd	They have some programs that they won't miss.
sv	Well, and things are repeated, so often that you know if I have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show . if I ever decide to tune it in again,
sv	Pretty funny.
sd	But, T V is something that we to not, deliberately try not to get hung up on it, like you say.
 sd	and there's a lot of good children's programs that they could watch several hours every day.
sd	Even if they're, good programs you don't want them sitting there watching them.
 o	Anyway. Well,
ad^t	and, I guess it's time to go.
fc	Nice to have spoken with you, too.
 fc	Bye bye.
 b	Uh huh.
 sd	I like to do like physical things like sports.
sd	and my favorite is volleyball,
sd	I live up at the college, So sometimes it's hard for me to do that,
sd	I go to my room and I like walk in, turn the radio on, or, you know, just kind of like veg out or something.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
sd	I like to do that stuff, but like when I'm at school, I don't have time to do it or even time to learn how to do it.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Like, I have, I come from a family of twelve children,
 sd	so you know, that's a change, because there's nine of them that are younger than me.
sd	I guess talking on the phone is one of my hobbies too.
sd	well, I'm not much of a basketball fan either.
 b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	not that I like reading, but I do do a lot of reading while I'm here at school.
qy	Do you like reading as a hobby?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
b	yeah.
qy^d	I know one thing that's pretty popular with the girls up here at college, and I make them also, is the padded covered photo albums?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I know they're real popular here at school, also.
b	Uh huh.
sv^t	I really don't have any other.
b	Uh huh.
fc	It was nice talking to you too.
fc	Thanks.
qr	do you have a home, or apartment?
qy	do you have to do a lot of upkeep?
b	Uh huh.
bk	Okay .
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
sd	but it takes about an hour with the two of us working to, you know, do the bushes and all of that sort of thing.
sd	the worst part is controlling the weeds. Which I hate because we don't like to use a lot of the chemicals and, because, like, we have a dog and, you know, he's going to be out in the yard and who knows who he eats out there.
sd	I get to put out all the Christmas lights out there and all that, sort of thing .
bh	No?
sd	like, one year we did the edge of the house all the way up on the roof
sd	I decided I was afraid .
sd	that's all it gets.
b	Uh huh.
ba	wow.
ba	no.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba@	no . But you still have to pay for it, even though they're not going to do it?
qy	is it real expensive?
 ba	gosh.
ba	my goodness.
qy	Well, do they do other things for you all?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	But you knew when you moved in, you'd have to pay that, didn't you?
b	Oh .
b	Yeah.
ba	That's interesting.
qy	do things like plant bushes and trees?
bk	okay.
qy	So, there is, like, no restriction on what types of bushes you can have or anything like that?
sd	I ripped most of them out and put them somewhere in the back.
sd	But that was a lot of work.
sd	Took me a long time.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, We won't go through that again,
sd	I will pay someone to do it .
sd	it took so long.
sd	there is a machine that will do it.
sv	And I guess that costs you an absolute fortune.
sd	By hand.
sd	but it works great now that we've got it.
sd	it's nice.
sd	you know, you have to keep the area moist
sd	so, we had an incentive there to do that.
sd	Well Amy it's been, kind of overcast today and cloudy.
sd	he was having a kite day,
sd	and it's been pretty rainy looking.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know it just has that,
sd	several times in the last couple of weeks it has looked rainy that day and not done anything.
sd	they're pretty old, big tall trees,
sd@	and so if it's an overcast day then the weather is pretty blah . Because I really have to catch some sunshine or else I feel like I live in a cave all the time,
b	Uh huh.
ba	I bet.
b	Yeah.
sv	That makes a big difference
sd	and , I thought, well, I'm just not anxious to have worry about the weather.
b	Well, yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	we have some extreme weather in each season,
^q	it's not going to be so humid,
sd	that has just not been the case.
sd	It has been,
sd	my car, I thought it was going die last Summer
sv	I guess it just couldn't handle, the stress, and the record heat,
sd	and, you know, I was worried about every time we came to an intersection the car started idling rough, you know, because of the extreme heat.
ba	I know.
sd	but I, understand that this is kind of typical for this time of year that rainy season.
b	Uh huh.
b	No.
b	Sure.
sd	Brown.
sv	and they want to go out and run in it and get all muddy, You know,
qh	so you're going do I want a green lawn or a muddy feet , in the house.
sd	the nice thing I'm looking forward to is, not having a hurricane season.
sd	and, you know, you had to have a supply like, emergency supply on hand all the time during the hurricane season,
sd@	and it was pretty spooky . because you always have to think, you know, what's the weather doing,
sd	And do we have enough, you know, food storage, and enough, batteries and all the kinds of things.
ba	That's right.
sd	Well yeah, I don't really like tornadoes either,
sd	so, not too much of that.
sd	and, I can't believe the record temperatures that
 +	were here last Summer that,
sd	it was just unbelievably hot.
aa	That is pretty bad.
ba	I can't imagine.
sv	but I guess the weather hasn't changed too much from here to Houston
sd	like you say coming a little bit further up north. It's a little bit nicer to have a Spring and a Fall season, where you have some pleasant weather everyday where you can feel like you just want to open your windows
b	Uh huh.
sv	and, it feels good
nn	No
ba	no.
ba	Now, that sounds awful.
sd	I have driven around in the neighborhoods and seen those little flood gauges that will be at little yellow signs,
sd	and I thought I would never buy a house with a flood gauge down the street.
sd	that would be awful.
fc	Well, I've got some kids out on the trampoline I need to go look and see what they're doing.
fc	Well, you too.
qy^d	Say you did, starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	She had to label everything.
qw	What was she driving?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	quad not really easy to get rebuilt just right.
qw	and like, what were you replacing the starters and bendix on?
qy	Did you replace just the, bendix on the Chrysler station wagon or the whole starter?
sd	The starters are kind of fragile.
sd	Especially if you need a tune up.
sd	and it starts up
sd	and when it's properly tuned up, that starter will last for a long time.
sd	See, they built that starter so it would fit every V eight and all the slant sixes that they've built in like thirty five years.
sd	but they geared it down so the motor spins really fast so it's got, to spin for very long,
sd	it's kind of tough on the bushings.
sd	Usually what goes is the bushings.
sd	But, most places don't rebuild them with g , with good enough bushings.
sd	after you get rebuilt one, you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly, especially if you need a tune up.
qw	Anyway, what are you driving now?
ba	That's good.
qy	is that Chrysler van?
qy	one of the little mini vans?
sd	Do you like the way it rides and stuff?
qy^d	Rides rough?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	right now, without getting some of the sportier models, the four cylinders aren't real peppy.
sd	But, they're starting to change that out in the last couple of years, too.
sd	every time I turned around I was having trouble with it.
sd	well, I starting working my father's service station when I was about, twelve.
sd	Had a super B for a while with a four forty in it.
sd	It was a lot of fun.
sd	It got about seventeen.
sd	but
sd	Didn't have to work too hard to move the car around.
sd^e	definitely.
sd	When I rebuilt the engine on that, about a hundred and thirty thousand on the car.
sd	Well, Wayne, I've never done any, auto repairs myself at all.
qo	what's your experience been like?
b	Uh huh.
 b	Right.
 b	Uh huh.
ba	That makes sense.
b	yes.
b	Right .
 b	Uh huh.
ba	I'm sure it was.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
 sd	and he hasn't given it to someone else.
sd	and he just isn't one of them.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Right.
b	No.
b	Uh huh.
sd	you know, that it's, , really has a bad reputation is to feel that people in general feel and have rightly so, I think been cheated many times,
sd	they had punctured a big hole in it when it really could have just been patched or whatever,
sd	And, so, Kelly growing up, he felt like that was a good way on Saturday's that he developed a good relationship with his father.
sd	And so, they used car repairs kind of as a way to have you know, something that they did together,
sd	so, that's one way he looked at it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	so, I haven't tried to do a lot myself.
b	Uh huh.
^q	and I know what's going on
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	as far as, universal health care I guess I'm all for it.
sv	it doesn't matter if you have money no mone , or all the money in the world,
sv	But, the expenses right now for health care, are just unreal.
b	Yes.
b	sure.
^q	and I can, you know,
sv	And in a universal system I don't think there is a financial gain for the doctors.
sv	The quality I think goes down. Uh huh
 +	when you have a universal system.
sv	I guess that's the whole U S concept is to come here and,
sd	That's what they look at it as.
sv	and that's sad because if that's the case, if doctors aren't going in to be doctors to help people then maybe they shouldn't be in that area anyway.
sv	But that might be one way of weeding out those that are greedy for the money and those that really want to help mankind.
sv	But I think we have to head toward that way.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm worried when I get older.
sd	You no longer have insurance.
sd	I mean and you're sixty some or fifty some years old you try to find insurance.
 sv	I mean you're uninsurable. Unless you want to pay five hundred, six hundred dollars a month
sd	and I know people that are paying two hundred, three hundred dollars a month for insurance.
sd	it was like eighty dollars out of my paycheck.
b	Yeah.
sv	it's getting harder and harder to survive.
sv	And, and that's why, if they don't go to a universal system, something is going to happen.
o	Okay.
sd	and, of course I like the PEOPLE magazine because it's gossipy and it's fast reading,
sd	And then I will purchase a GOOD HOUSEKEEPING occasionally, especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and and things like that
qy	and, do you subscribe to any magazines?
qy^d	you probably have smaller children younger children.
sd	our children are grown
sd	and, I'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren .
qy	Well, do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to?
sd	now my husband does that,
sd	you know, and of course, naturally WALL STREET JOURNAL, you know and, or SPORTS ILLUSTRATED,
sd	and I took them all
sd	in the seventies, maybe, late seventies they changed their format
sv	I don't think there's been a magazine as they used to be
sv	even GOOD HOUSEKEEPING I don't,
sd	My sister, takes, TOWN AND COUNTRY and VOGUE
sv	and there's really nothing in them but advertisements for very expensive clothes, very expensive jewelry things that the average middle class citizen is not going to be purchasing
sd	you know, and if I want to drool or if I want to see how the other half is living you know, then I look through them
sd	they're not something I, you know, take any length of time over.
sd	I have discovered that, you know, with my available time, I would rather actually read a book than a magazine.
b	Yes
b	Yes .
sd	I will read them in a doctor's office, too.
sd	I like reading, you know, the PASSAGE OF PEOPLE or something you know,
sd	it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when I was young
sd	It's quick reading you know,
sd	and sometimes after I've worked all day and have things to do at night, I just, I want fluff
sd	I don't want a lot of thinking .
qy^c	Are you still there?
qw	So what's, things that you look for when you go out to dinner?
b	Uh huh.
sd	We try to get out maybe like once every month and a half or something like that,
sd	but I definitely want to go to a place that's nice and clean, you know.
sv	You know, you see cockroaches crawling around and everything, you know.
sd	and then I like you know, good food and good service.
b	right.
qy	So is there some nice places to go to eat in Plano?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
ba	that sounds beautiful.
sd	Well. This is only a little small city.
sd	You know, they have prime rib on, weekends
sd	and the atmosphere there is really, really nice.
sd	So, and then if we really want to, you know, something different we go to Modesto which is like twenty minutes away.
sd	But, we don't have any fast foods here in this small city .
br^m	Do I have kids?
sd	but he's grown up.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	All the kids seem to love McDonald's don't they, you know.
sd	I'm sure there isn't.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I know.
qw^t	Well, let's see, what else can we talk about? .
sd	it's foggy and cold here.
b	Yeah
na	I came from Iowa when I was sixteen
sd	so I've lived out in California for a long, long time.
sd^e	I like it real well.
sd	so we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there you know,
sd	so, right in Chinatown, so we went to lots of restaurants Chinese restaurants,
sd	I really miss them. You know.
sd^e	I really don't miss living there.
sd	I just like to go in there and have a nice Chinese dinner once in a while, you know.
sd	It's close enough if I wanted to go there, to San Francisco for dinner or something, why, you know, an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and you know, have dinner and then come on back.
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	so I don't even know what the law is, in the state,
bh	do you?
sd	I think now, that I recall, reading about it in the paper.
qy	is it restricted to certain crimes?
b	Uh huh.
sv	I mean they're anxious for someone to be killed .
sd	I can't see that.
b	Uh huh.
ar	No.
sv	Well, there is so many chances for appeal, that it kee ,
sv	it's really sad.
sd	somehow I hoped that as a people we could be better than, expecting, the feeling that it
sv	someone is calling for someone else to be killed, you know.
sv	Is really kind of bad .
sv	and there really are criminals that are hard core and, repeat, and never have any chance for,
qy	do you feel at all like, it's a religious issue?
b	Uh huh.
sv	But like you say, if it hit you personally, closer at home you would feel, feel differently.
qy	Do you think most states have that
b@	Uh huh,
ba	that's right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	there's a lot of people that are on death row. But there's not very many people that actually, do get killed.
sv	and then through appeals.
sd	I mean they cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper.
sd	If it finally gets to that point.
b	Yeah.
qy	are we doing lethal injection now?
sv	which seems so awful.
sv	I guess, it is,
sv	the other one just seems so terrible.
qrr	or, it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
sv	It's, It's kind of been scary, to think about it
sd	and, And you're hoping there is something that will cut down on that.
sv	You hate to have the dubious honor of being, you know, so high in the, in statistics,
sd	our family, hasn't had any crime.
sv	it's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way.
sv	And how they would expect, how they would hope,
sv	I mean you hear of people who have, committed crimes, and then they get out of jail and they go, and they do the same thing again.
sv	And you wonder why they can't just stop it.
sv	So, maybe you would,
sd	but still I would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone.
sd	we moved here, I got a jury summons,
sv	just like constantly, it seemed like,
sd	and I didn't have to go.
sv	I mean, I think everyone should have to serve on the jury,
sd	I hate having to be in charge of someone else's life.
sd	And I would hate to have to hear any kind of case, involving a violent crime or anything.
ba	That would be really awful.
sd	Well, anyway, I sure have enjoyed, talking to you about this. Although it has been difficult
sv	I'd hate to decide it, but I guess it's important, that we decide as a people what we're going to do.
fc	Anyway, well, you have a good day.
fc	bye bye.
qy	up in, T I out there?
b	right .
sd^e^t	I just hit one then.
qr	Are you Republican or Democrat?
 sd	so I was going to say if you're a Republican, boy we would really have a good time.
 ad	You first.
sv	Go ahead loan your money out, you know.
sv	Not just a couple.
b	Right.
sd	and he lost, you know, all of his money before he died.
sv	and they just never even got conservative with our money at all.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	And, it hasn't worked now.
ba^r	no doubt.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sv	and not high quality ones at that, you know.
 sv	a lot of the workers don't understand that, they need to put out the best that they can because it comes right back to them, you know.
^q	so it doesn't matter, you know.
b^r	Right.
sv	You don't sound like a nonexempt, Jim.
sv	You don't sound like a nonexempt.
sd	I'm being a Yankee, I guess I'm letting my Yankee come out, you know.
b	Yeah.
ba	well that's good.
sd	I know a few people,
qy	like do you do technician work or something?
bk	quality, okay.
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean there literally is no installation work going on.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	and so if that's true, it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that went down the tube somewhere.
bh	I know what you mean.
qy	but are they pretty good up there?
b	really.
sd	Well we're in the metroplex here, you know,
sd	And, I don't know how, Bell didn't get it.
sd	And, they advertised that it was T I Bell and then all of a sudden, Secorski got it, yeah.
 o	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
sv	there's a lot of air pollution.
sv	I think industries and companies provide a lot of it
sv	and, I guess with the oil burning over in Kuwait and stuff, that would have a lot of air pollution in it.
sd	I'm north of Pittsburgh,
b	Yeah.
sd	and like they get fined whenever they do the air pollution
sv	but the fine is nothing, you know,
b^r	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my God .
 b	Uh huh.
sv	but you know, that doesn't seem to stop them there
sd	I don't know what else they can do.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I don't think it's something that people really think about, either.
sv	I don't think we really have too much control over it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I really don't know too much else about it.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and and you just have smoke going out into the air for a day or two, until you can get it fixed.
sd	so, you know, it's something we have tried to help.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
fc	It's been nice talking to you.
fc	bye bye.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think I agree with that very much.
qy	and it's for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I never have either.
qy@	Is there a reason why you have never, Uh huh.
sd	so I always assumed that that was why I was never called.
b	Uh huh.
qy	do they have such a thing now as a six man jury?
sd	and I wondered if it was true.
sd	and that I wasn't sure on either, whether it should be unanimous or not.
qy^d	That would mean they all would have to decide one way or the other.
b^r	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
^2	Bring some of these things out.
b	Uh huh.
sv	since my husband worked as a policeman, I can't believe there are very many people that come to trial that are not guilty of some part of whatever they're accused of.
sv	but, I would suppose there are circumstances, you're in the wrong place at the right time, or know the wrong person at the right time.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
qy^d	They still found him guilty?
qy^d	When people said he was at work?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	So there's nine years of that man's life gone.
b	Uh huh.
sv	we bend over backwards protecting the guilty people, the one's that are on trial.
sv	And, And we often forget about the one the injustice has been done because I they still say our system is the best in the world.
sv	I think they've lost sight of some things that are very important to our country.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	but I don't know if I'd go that far.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's important in so many facets of our lives.
sv	And, I feel like if people don't like what our flag stands for, they're welcome to go some place else.
sv	There's nobody holding them here.
sv	I'm sure.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	do you think that's good you know, like if a jury,
ny	Uh huh.
qy^d	Make a recommendation?
qy	Do they sometimes make a recommendation?
sd	That's what I was thinking they sometimes do.
sd	And then the judge has the final decision on what does really happen. Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It depends on you know, what they'd been guilty of, and a lot of different things, I guess.
sv	And there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody.
sv	It doesn't make sense.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	right.
 sv	Improve it if we can, if we ever get a chance.
fc	and I hope you have a real good day and week.
fc	I hope not.
fc	You, too.
qw	what major changes have affected your life?
qr	You mean yourself, or women in general?
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and I'm sure you've labelled the cause, because what strikes me the most in the changes in society is the way kids behave.
sv	and there's just no respect for people or property,
sv	and I guess, you know, when you stop to think of it, these kids have probably been deprived of a lot of attention that they've needed all their lives.
sv	Scary,
qw	But for how many years?
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's great.
 b	Uh huh.
 b	Right.
sd	and so I'd be gone, you know, an hour and fifteen minutes or something at a stretch.
sd	and you know, nobody seemed to have a big problem with that .
sv	So. That's an interesting issue though.
sv	But I think you put your finger on it, when you said that they're not respected if they don't work, because it seems to me that a lot of people I know, women I know, are doing very menial jobs in a certain sense, certainly financially
sd	and, I mean, when I see the amount of clothes that they buy and how much it costs them to buy fast food on the way home I'm sure that they're not quote making money for the family on this
sv	and probably you're right.
sd	I mean, you know, when I think of this one friend who makes probably twenty thousand dollars a year, I'm sure she spends at least that in clothes, plus, you know, fast food every day, and out to lunch every day,
sv	our society demands women to work if they're going to be respected.
sv	Really sad .
ba	that's true.
b	Uh huh.
sv	so that might be a positive change in society.
sd	I guess I haven't seen that as much in this area, although every now and then you hear about it.
sv	there are those people who have had serious questions all along, and, you know, are sort of pursuing it
sv	and I thought it was more because of the very transient nature of the area and that people were going basically just as you said, as a social to meet people, and that,
sv	and there are a lot of things changing, I suppose,
sv	Just, you know, the whole environment, I find sort of, you know,
sd	and, you know, young people that I know are getting very serious diseases
b	Probably.
sv^t	Well, I guess we've sort of run dry a little bit.
fc	It was nice talking to you.
fc	Bye bye.
ad	I'll let you go ahead .
b	uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd	I always thought it'd be great to have twins.
b	Well, yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Your first ones you mean, it, was this way?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
ba	That's difficult.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
sd	but drugs in Texas, are extremely bad.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, that's all you can do.
qy	Well, I was going to ask, too, does your wife work?
qy^d	She just recently started working then.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, we also have five children.
sv	When you have younger ones to take care of, you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones.
sd	and those activities helped a lot in, giving us things to do with the children.
qy^d	T lives in Pittsburgh, you probably don't know where that is.
sd	He works right on the border of D C.
sd	and our baby lives just a mile over the hill , so, we'll get to see her a little more than, what we do the other ones.
sd	Well, they have to.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And that does make a big difference.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Let's face it, you know, we're not none of us like they portray it on those shows.
sv	I mean, life's much more difficult than that.
sd	I'm kind of old fashioned, I guess, that way.
sd	I don't think I ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It does, it,
o@	and, * slash error  okay.
sd	A lot of the people I've talked to work for, for the same.
qy^d	Which your income would be a lot better, now.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And it's, kind of a waste of a person.
o	You know.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	And you, you recognized this and, was able to, you know, do something about it.
sv	Well, it puts a strain on everybody, your wife and your family.
sv	And, the only thing you can remember is to try and stay together as much as you can, because it's very easy to, go your own direction when you're working so hard and going to school, too.
ba	Well, that's wonderful.
sd	so, he's been retired for three years now.
sv	That's quite a change.
sd	well, he made it at fifty .
sd	and he still works part time at other thing, you know, same job as he was doing, only he's retired and doing it independently.
o	Okay .
sd	But we have one, we are going to have one on Memorial Day, I guess.
sd	They have had one the last two years. We go out to my dad's farm and, you know, it is just a picnic and spend the night. Go fishing and stuff like that.
sd	about ten.
b	Huh uh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	my, dad has a house out there anyway.
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	it is, it is like a country home.
aa	Uh huh.
sd^e	The grandchildren.
sd	So the big family is a lot smaller that it used to be.
sd	It is near Lake Texoma.
sd	all of his children live in the Dallas area too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	French reunion?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
^2@	Meet in the middle. Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	And they do not have to clean up afterwards.
b	Yeah.
br	I am sorry?
sd^e	he does not really have any, domestic livestock anyway.
sd	But, he leased, to his neighbor for the cattle to feed on.
sd	He has a garden and, a lot of fruit trees and blueberry bushes and things.
sd	And then there is wild blackberries there too.
b	Huh.
sd	they're kind of off and on it seems like.
sd	Depends on the rain.
na	it is, eighty acres.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah.
sd	you just spend time on maybe ten acres of it.
sd	because that is where the ponds are and where everybody fishes.
sd	we have not been able to catch any of the adult bass yet.
sd	they are in there, but they are real spooky.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Never saw the bass?
bk	Oh.
sv	it is probably in there just burping goldfish.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	they really do.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And, they routinely use them for bait for, goldfish for bait for yellow catfish.
sd	They live in the Mississippi River all the way through Minnesota and up into Canada.
b	Uh huh.
b@	 Uh huh.
sd	That is what happens .
sd	Because they will just come after anything then.
sd	And you could catch a couple anyway during that time.
sd	it is, catfish food.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Well, I do not know how much different it is from dog food but, you know, it looks like Purina High Pro.
b	Yeah.
sd	because they come up to the top, and you can see their whiskers come through the water.
sd	the big catfish just kind of vacuum the top of the water.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, they are really funny fish.
sd	When you catch them, they make a kind of a burping, growling sound at you.
sd	And they try to hit you with their tails.
sd	I think the world record is fifty some pounds.
sd	that is only about three and a half feet long.
b	Yeah,
sd	they get real fat.
sd	they stay slender until they get to be, eighteen inches long, and then they start to widen
sd	She was fishing for sunfish.
sd	and, you know, it was just pulling drag out.
sd	And it swimmed wherever it wanted to.
fc	It was nice talking to you.
fc	Bye bye.
fc	Have a nice Memorial weekend.
o	Okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I believe in it, too .
sv	you know, on the premeditated murders I feel you know, I mean, if it's beyond a doubt that you did it, you know I would say go ahead and execute that person as well.
qh	Well, you know, you got, you got that point well, you know, what if a mistake is made and you put someone, you know, to death that really didn't do it.
sv	but, I would say that, you know, for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated, it would be kind of hard for, you know,
qy^d	You know what I'm saying?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that, that anyone anyone from Pennsylvania had gotten it.
qy	do you know if Virginia has it?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know Florida has it.
b	Yeah.
b	you know,
sv	and you don't really hear about it real often, how many people,
sv	I mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed, you know, compared to that and to how many people are being sent, that doesn't seem like very many.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's true, too.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	And then they get out.
sv	they get out in three years on probation,
sv	and they do it again, you know.
sv	It's like a slap on the fingers for them.
qy	but, are you, would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think some of them would rather be in jail .
sv	They probably have it better in jail than what they would out in the streets.
^h	I don't even remember what it was now.
sd	I'm at Clarion University.
b	Yeah
sd	we only have seven thousand students in the entire campus.
sd	we're about two hours north of Pittsburgh if that would help you out any.
sd	North of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
no	I've never heard of Polk
sd	I never heard of that.
sd	It might have a new name.
b^r	yeah.
sd	We're probably about an hour away from Sharon.
sd	but then after I would say my point of view, then they'll say, well, yeah,
sv	anyone that is like so against it that you couldn't persuade them in any instance.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv@	but you know I look at that and say, well, they should have thought about that beforehand. You know.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but, whether they plea bargain or not, if they're guilty of murder, they're guilty of murder, you know.
sv	So I don't think that they deserve anything less .
h	I don't know,
sd	and that costs money, yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, basically I am a mother of a three year old,
sd	so I kind of relate to trying to find a good day care because it's, extremely hard thing to do to trust somebody else with your child, trust their emotional and their safety and all the rest of that.
sd	and what I'm finding is with, day cares that are like day care centers like, for instance, Learning Tree or Kinder Care and all of that.
sd@	What I find is that they're highly structured, highly organized. Almost too rigid for the children if you bring a child in at a certain time. like nap time or whatever time, because of parents' hours they are differ ,
sd	Everybody is napping, whether they came there an hour before or they came right during that time.
sd	And with that kind of a system my daughter just isn't likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down, on a cot.
sd	The only thing is you raise the question of if it's safe, can you trust the people, you know.
sd	And, To the point that you kind of say to yourself, especially home day care
sv	I mean, I think center day cares there's so many people coming in and out that you're better off if you're going to put a child into that type of system for eight hours, it's fine.
sv	but home day care works well if it's an infant.
sv	if it's, if you want to have kind of like a family structuring where there's a home that they can be provided. Because I've seen things at the day care where they can't keep up with all the kids.
sd	The kids have, colds
sd	but, ours are just major credit cards that we have and, use only , when we feel it's necessary to make a big purchase.
ny	Yeah.
sd^e	one Sears.
sd	Sears is pretty major with us simply because we do, Appliances and things like that
sv	and they're real good with their appliance and stuff like that
sv	but if it's, any large purchases, you've got to kind of think about, how much you're going to put down as far as, payments on it so that you're not getting eighteen percent or twenty percent interest taken off,
b	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah.
b^r	sure.
b	Sure,
aa	Exactly.
aa^r	Exactly .
sv	Or, if it's a business transaction a lot of times that's important, too to keep a better receipt of it.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
b	yeah.
b	sure.
b	yeah.
sd	or it's preapproved for,
sv	that's to entice you to get more credit cards.
sd	I mean, you know, you always constantly getting those preapproved stuff,
sd	ours is through a bank, yeah. * should they 'yeah' be a seperate slash unit?
sd	We had it a long time ago through a bank
sv	that's exactly it
fc	Okay.
fc	Okay.
fc	thanks a lot.
qy	Can you think of anything else that's happened recently?
b	Uh huh.
sv	and, and they made references to in the past, how we have given arms to, Nicaragua and to other places in Latin America, and that those might turn around and haunt us someday.
sv	I mean, not to this large scale as Iraq,
sv	whenever we give arms to people, as we did, and as we sold arms pardon me, to Iraq, when we wanted them to fight Iran, and then it turn around and,
b	Uh huh.
sd	the time that I've studied in Mexico, Spanish was one of my majors in college, there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards America,
sv	our interest there is, you know, what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them,
sd	I mean, there's just very few really modern cities.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and so many communities have to have that for farming .
sv	And they don't look at it so much as, you know,
ba	That's right.
sv	And I think it's really very sad that north of the border, you know, the United States and Canada is so different, from South America, and Central America.
sv	There's really a disparity between what I would call civilization of the countries, you know.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it's really kind of sad, that we would go all the way to Iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between Jerusalem and, Israel and the Middle East Arab countries, and when we have a lot of problems, r , right in our own back door.
sv	So I guess we've kind of neglected Latin America.
^2	recently ,
 %	but I,
sd	made me stop and think a minute about, not worrying so much about the Middle East crisis.
sd	I know that it's not settled but, there are other areas that we could focus our attention on.
fc	you have a good day.
fc	Bye bye.
qw	Well, what kind of garden do you have?
b	Oh.
 b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you have a lawn?
b	yeah.
sd	And, the peonies have been out for now about three weeks
sd	and of course I've got lots of weeds in mine because, I don't use any poison either.
sd(^q)	and I say, Jeez, you know, this is the first year it's been so perfect.
sd	my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall
^q	we'll have a freeze.
sd	and sure enough, you know, we had really mild weather until I think it was May or something
sd	and then, you know, everything just got hit hard .
sd	My son does the mowing of the grass.
sd	I don't think that's a pleasure for anybody, the mowing.
b	Uh huh.
sv	they help you.
sv	I mean the peach tree is a start
qy	aren't they pretty hardy?
 b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 sv	I mean, you've got three or four months you're talking about of bad weather.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
ba	dear.
ba	Sounds like it would have been pretty.
ba^r	sure.
sv	Well, it sounds like you've got your hands full .
sv	but it's not off the list.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sv	Maybe next year they'll do better.
fc	well, thanks.
o	Okay.
sd	Capital punishment.
sv	but we seem to have a duality of, in this country where most states in theory have it, but, but do not use it.
sv	Texas uses it about as much as any other state.
sd	Texas is a big state,
sd	people are sometimes sentenced to capital punishment, but no one actually has the sentence carried out.
sd^e	I think so.
sv	the sentence of life without possibility of parole, has become a common one, and is being used much more.
sd^e	prisons are overcrowded.
sd	you're certainly in the majority at least in this country.
sv	we are, I guess, the only one of the major Western nations currently with capital punishment.
sv	but they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates.
sv	we tend to be skeptical.
qy	however the question is is that making the difference.
b	Oh.
sv	I think that idea is even more common in Western Europe.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	Me, too.
ad	you want to start first ?
b	Right.
qy^d	You apparently have somebody there, in one.
qy	you are kidding?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	for heaven's sake.
sv	You are very, very much aware of what goes on.
ba	That is great.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
ba	I will be darned.
sv	Now, see that is a nice attitude to go into.
sv	it seems like they must be waiting until it is a necessity
sv	and there is no chance of, good companionship or doing anything.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	But what I mean is instead of maybe entering a nursing home, when you are still able to have good,
 +	relationships with, maybe other friends they wait until they are, you know, unable.
b^r	right.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	That is great.
ba	that sounds great.
b	Uh huh.
sv	See if they could get this idea across though, better than what it is, you, know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	well you have that with anything.
b	yeah .
sd	Well,
sd	like when my sister was real bad before she died we took her the last month and a half, into a nursing home.
sd	And they were super with her.
sd	They were,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	They , left them temporally maybe they had a, broken hip or something or,
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	And it can become home to them.
sv	It, It depends upon the individual.
b^r	uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	There has to be consideration taken on everything.
b	Yeah.
sv	you would look into it thoroughly and, do the best job you could in choosing one.
sd	that is what, I am saying,
sv	most people will not even look at that until it becomes a necessity.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and he did fine,
sd	they lived on a farm,
sd	but she made arrangements, so that when she was gone, she did not want her children, her other children burdened with his care.
sd	So they, she has made arrangements that when she was gone, that he would go into the nursing home.
sd	and, he, he has been there quite a long time.
sd	And, he don't know me usually .
sd	Somebody else, is helping him out, you know,
aa	Yes.
b^r	uh huh
ba	True.
sv	But , for some reason people resist, the fact that they should be paid as well as businesses and that type of thing, you know.
sv	It seems to be a resistance.
b^r	right.
sv	But there seems to be a resistance.
b^r	yeah.
sd	Well, around here, we have some, you know, the churches, take the children
sd	and, I know our kids thoroughly,
o	Okay .
sd^t	I had to press one.
na	Sure.
ny	Uh huh.
sv	I think we should have stayed longer.
sv	but I think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do.
sv	and there is not going to be anything left of Iraq at all .
sv	Well, I don't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it,
sv	I just mean that, the world in general .
sv	I think we should have helped the innocent people in Iraq out a little bit more, rather than just quitting where we did.
sv	But I think that's almost impossible, next to impossible.
qw	What did he say about it?
sv	We don't have the money for that.
na	It would be really nice because I'm kind of tired of driving in pot holes .
fa^c	I'm sorry, I dropped the phone .
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
nn	huh uh.
sd	Only in Ohio.
sd	I've seen,
sd	I've seen pictures of it
sd	and we we're never able to take vacations because there's twelve kids in the family.
ba	my.
b	Uh huh.
b	Really.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And, it's pretty, like, windy and hilly.
sd	It wouldn't be like a mountain.
sd	I have no clue.
na	I would say it's closer to sea level.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	the farthest away from home?
sd	Probab , I'd say five or six.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my Gosh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Now see for me, that's a long ways.
sv	So that will give you some idea of where I'm at.
sd	And I'm about, I'm about two hours north east of Pittsburgh.
sd	I mean, there's just no one around.
sd	and between what I make in the summer and student loans, that's how I go to college.
sd	Finance.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, like I said my fianc3ee, * typo
sd	I'd rather work for a company and, like be their financial advisor or something.
b	Uh huh.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Well, well what would be the unemployment rate out there?
sd	See that's what it is here too.
b	Uh huh.
fp	Hi, Kay.
qw	I, was thinking about salaries and benefits and was wondering what's the most important thing to you besides a salary in a job.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
sd	you know we have that Aetna
sd	that's the insurance that we have right now.
sd	When we were in Colorado, they had, a different type of H M O there that I really liked a lot.
sd	It was, not that kind of H M O s where you have to go to their sort of like clinics, you know
sd	but it was with a certain list of doctors that, you know, participated in the H M O,
sd	and, you know, then you only had to pay the,
sd	for us it was a five dollar co payment every time you went to the doctor, and, three dollars for the prescriptions.
sd	And, I especially liked the prescription, especially since my children tend to have ear infections all the time .
sd	those prescriptions can be very expensive.
sv	especially if you get, what is it, Seclor I think that that just about breaks the bank right there.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do, Do you have the basic plan or do you have the other one?
na	Right.
sd	they'll pay a little bit more I think for the different procedures.
sd	A couple of times we've had to pay, I don't know, three to five dollars but that's not that bad.
b	Uh huh.
sd	we don't like that either .
b^r	uh huh.
 b	that's not bad.
b	Right.
ba	you're not kidding.
ba	That's right.
sd	Well, those are some of the things that are very important to us too.
sd	the athletic facilities that you sometimes take advantage of I think that's pretty nice,
sv	But that's a nice benefit to have.
b	Right.
sd	I mean they're going through some tough times to say the least.
sd@	job. one of the drawbacks, I think, of working for a big company, is often times, you do have to follow pretty rigid, guidelines,
sv	A lot of times smaller companies have bonus plans, where I think in a large company it's hard to do that because there're just so many people to deal with
sv	that's one of the things that happens when you're dealing with a large company.
b	Uh huh.
o@	Right . * slash error How long has he been in his present position?
b	Uh huh.
sv	In a big company, though, you also get moved around a lot .
sd	He may be having to drive over here to Lewisville some time.
sv	you never know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	We're very,
sd	In fact, this is a little off the topic, but yesterday, my mother happened to be on a train going from Phoenix back to Chicago
sd	and we went downtown, and met her train for half an hour, and brought her a little snack and an Easter basket
sd	I mean, just for us to snatch a half hour like that is a special occasion for us.
sv	it's nice. It's nice that you can have your family close like that.
sd	sometimes it can be.
b	Okay .
fc	Well, I have too.
fc	you too.
 ad	now you can tell me what you do.
b	Uh huh.
ba	great.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and the pay is decent.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	I had a granddaughter .
b	Right.
qy	Do you have major medical benefits?
sv	it depends on what your deductible is how high it is.
sd	that's pretty high,
b	Right.
sd	And five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your major medical, too.
sd	course we live in a rural sort of setting
sd	and where she works she has no benefits at all.
sd	And her wage is not very good .
sd	Of course, living expenses aren't as bad either, though, which makes a difference.
sd	Well, she has to pay for it herself
sd	you know, they have to pay for their own insurance.
sd	they're not that much different.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Is that right?
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's a big difference.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	should be.
b@	Yes. Uh huh.
 ^2^r	it would be more convenient, too.
sd	they have to take their two children to day care, you know.
sd	getting them there and going to work, and then picking them up and, all the preparations.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think those benefits you mentioned, sometimes they're even more important than the wage itself.
sv	they come out to a much better benefit than an increase in your wage a lot of times.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	it would make it a lot better.
b	Uh huh.
sv	well, and if it was there, you would really have a little more, knowledge on what's going on probably, you know, with your child.
b	yeah.
sd	and they, where she works they don't have anything like that.
ng	Pittsburgh.
sd	Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	so they were very flexible
sv	and that would be great,
sv	They say you're going to do it this way, and that's the way it's going to be.
b	Yeah.
b^r	yeah.
sv	well, that's true in any company, I think.
sd	I've maybe worked five years out of our married life you know, out of the home
sd	but, the rest of the time I've been an Avon lady and a lady.
sd	and you have to take care of any benefits you want yourself,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 sv	Usually consultants make very good income.
bh	Is that right?
b	Uh huh.
sv	A consultant really should be more knowledgeable than everybody else, you know
sv	so it stands to reason they should really have more benefits.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
o	Okay.
nn	No.
sd	and that's how he got it.
sd	I just graduated from college.
aa	No.
^2	Or, what I'm looking for.
nn	huh uh.
nn	No.
sd	I've heard of that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	it can .
b	Uh huh.
ad	I like to think about that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^2	Not always safe .
b	Yeah.
ba	that's nice.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well there's twelve kids in my family.
sd	So the dental was very important, you know, to my dad.
sd	it's, you know, it's just another, you know telephone network.
sd	but now I think they're going to start getting into eye.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd@	But my fianc3e, he's on that same kind of pension as what you said only, for everything he puts in they'll match it, up to a certain amount.
sd	Like if he puts in a dollar they'll put in a dollar, you know.
sd	and they'll match it.
qy	did you ever hear of the National Bureau of Standards?
sd	and he'll be getting three weeks vacation.
sd	and he has all the holidays off.
sd	and it only costs a dollar as long as they go to that doctor.
sd	but still that works out really nice.
ba	That's not bad either.
b	Uh huh.
qo	So, what is your latest experience with painting?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	I had an addition put on
sd	and I decided, because my inner room looked so dingy, because I put these beautiful French doors in
sd	and, so I decided, okay, I'll just, you know, have them paint this little room, you know, a little ten by ten dining area.
sd	He said, Well, I'll be done this afternoon, you know
sd	and and he was there to paint the French doors also.
sd	and if you've ever painted French doors, which my husband just finally said he wasn't going to do , because it looked so formidable,
sd	so the whole project basically took a week .
sd	and each little, paint stroke, you know, the paint wasn't going on right is what it was.
sv	but that doesn't guarantee anything .
b	Right.
 ba	no.
sv	and that can make a difference, too.
sd	I mean, and they bring the, you know, little samples
sd	and it was like you said, you know, it was blue blue cast to it.
sd	He had to redo that too.
sd	and it was a major project getting the money together to do it too, by the end, of the whole project,
sv	I don't think he did the interiors very well .
b	No .
b	Uh huh.
sd	It wasn't a big deal for them.
 sd	I think my husband's really glad about that .
ba	For sure.
sd	you just get in there and do it yourself.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
h	I don't know.
sv	I don't know if you get into the mind set where you just say, Well, I'll accept something, or you just really have to get on their back, I mean, about things and working with what they say are professional painters.
sv	I tell you what, the fumes that the paint gives off makes you wonder what these people do any ,
sd	and I don't think I could stay sane, you know , working with all that.
fe	but, my goodness .
ba	it does.
b	Yeah.
sv	It makes you wonder .
fc	Well, I hope you have a nice day today.
fc	And you take care.
fc	Okay.
fc	Bye, Kay.
sd	and she's the only one that lives near by.
sd	and one lives near D. C.
b	Yeah
sd	we see them once in a while, a couple of times a year at least,
sd	and the ones in Pittsburg, of course, we see more often,
sd^t	I'm ready to go.
sd	one of the biggest problems seems to be they don't have anyplace to put some of the things that need recycled.
sd	Right now we've recycled glass for years because we have a glass industry in our community.
sd	Owens.
sd	and they have bins to collect those. the aluminum cans.
sd	what they were doing was shredding it and trying to sell it to farmers for bedding for their animals, and that type of thing.
sd	but somebody told me that they were charging as much for it as they did for straw. Which is why they couldn't sell it,
sd	you know, because the farmers would buy the straw if it's a, you know, similar price.
sd	mainly the glass, the aluminum, the plastics.
sd	and, we would like industry to do more before they build these big, huge incinerators.
sd	And, we just feel they should offer industry some incentives to do more reducing of their waste products and reusing,
sd	At first, apparently, it costs more to get started.
sv	But once they get established, then it's a money saving thing.
qw	And what is T I?
bk	okay.
ad	Excuse me, go ahead .
sd	he works in a computer laboratory.
sd	And, it was through him that,
qw	maybe you could tell me, what is the difference between office paper waste and just like newspapers?
b	really.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well it would be inconvenient in other words to,
^2	more areas where they would pick it up.
b	Yeah.
 b	Yeah.
b	uh huh.
sd	well, Knox is just over the hill here .
sd^e	They, they no longer are, you know, active.
b	Yeah.
ba	for heaven's sake.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, we only live probably about fifteen, twenty miles from Knox.
ny	uh huh.
b	yeah.
sd	We feel that they should give businesses more incentives to do more recycling and more reduction and more reuse and all those things that could be done.
sv	we just don't think, we don't think some of the politicians are really interested in our best interests.
sv	And, it's been a real struggle and a hardship for a lot of people in our area that we've, you know, have been fighting against this thing in trying to have things changed, to make them more right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	well, we're going to pay for that whether we pay industry or, pay,
sd	and it's our money that's cleaning this, stuff up.
sd	and that will make another hazardous dump
sd	We'll pay for it again,
qh	Why not pay industry a little more, and reduce it, you know, and not have as much of it. 
aa	definitely.
sv	but they think, and probably they're right, people buy it easier .
sd	We don't have anyplace right now that will take them.
b	yeah.
sd	So I've been concerned about crime lately.
sv	it's really scary to listen to the news every night and to hear about all the problems.
qy^d	I wondered if you were taking any special precautions in your neighborhood?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
b	No,
sd	and so } we've been trying to install some, outside lights
sd	and we put up a fence in the backyard.
sd	Mostly, you know, not so much thinking that we would deter someone to break in, but that our children would be safe playing in the yard. You know.
sd@	It's scary to send them off down the street a few houses . * should this end the slash unit? To let them go play with someone because of what you hear about people getting picked up and everything
sd	{D and so } I have to spend a good deal of time watching them , walk down the street and, say, call me before you leave and come back
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba@	no. That's a good thought.
sv	but it but it does seem that there is a lot more here in Plano of, just bored teenagers .
sd	Vandalism.
 sd	I know my sister in law who lives in our neighborhood they've had their,
sd	they parked their car out on the street before and it's been spray painted and
sd	because you don't know if it's someone their teenagers know or is it just random crime,
sd	but, we've been real lucky that no one in my family anywhere that they live has been a victim of, you know, a serious crime.
sv	But, it's really scary to know that you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen but it doesn't mean you'll be safe
sd	and, But, I guess I take little bit of, safety in knowing that a lot of the crimes that they report are, like drug related or things that,
sd	places usually that I wouldn't be going. And things I usually wouldn't be involved in.
sv	And, there's not so much of it completely innocent victims compared to,
sv	but it is scary.
qy	Were you raised in this area?
qr	So, has it been getting worse that you noticed, or about the same?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	we moved here from Houston not too long ago.
sd	so, of course, we were interested in schools
sv	and they're not really very safe
sd	and it's just a whole different idea that, at least the people here feel that their kids are pretty safe at school.
sv	And so that's been something that's been good you know, in this area that you feel like, you know, there's not going to be too many knifings or shootings at school today.
sd	I don't know how people live with that every day.
sv	Pretty scary.
sd	my name is Karen.
sd	I've probably personally take I think just two
sv	and you may be familiar with it from Wisconsin, is called COUNTRY.
sd	this one is the one they have all the pictures of scenery from places we wished we live, like Wisconsin .
sv	Gorgeous leaves and trees and all the lakes and the mountains and things.
sd	and that's my very favorite.
qw	What do you take?
^2	decorating.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Are you?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	We took NEWSWEEK
sd	and I think we took it especially just during the war to kind of catch up on everything and have it be digested.
sd	But we've kind of discontinued that right now
sd	I think it.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and we saved the ones from the war and one from the earthquake.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, you sound like you, That's the thing, you sound like you have the facilities to do that.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
ba	I bet it is gorgeous.
aa	I agree,
b	Uh huh.
b	right.
sd	I think I opened VOGUE the other day or something
sd(^q)	And I thought, Why buy this?
qh	You know, what's the point?
sd	And my number one pet peeve in a magazine, is when they put the perfume in it because, real often, I don't like very heavy perfumes
sv	and very often, like, you know, in my bills, also, magazines and bills, and they'll, come out just stinking , the whole thing.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
qr	or do you keep it?
b	Uh huh.
sd	See how the family liked it .
sd	Well, I'm going to pay attention more when I'm in the store to that COUNTRY LIVING, I remember seeing the cover.
sd	Back when I decorated the house with a lot of the little country, primitive things, the little pigs and the jeez, and the ducks, and that, that was the big rage here, couple of years ago.
sd	And I bought a lot of the country magazines
sd	but I had forgotten the recipes
cc	I'll have to check that out,
b	Uh huh.
^2	And you don't want to part with any of them because there's one thing in each one .
ba	that's good.
b	Uh huh.
b	right.
b	Right.
qw	what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Oh .
qy	You serve it cold?
ba	that sounds good.
sd	Usually when we entertain we do something really simple, because I like to visit with my company, and not be scurrying around in the kitchen,
sd	so, a lot of times, we'll barbecue
sd	and we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like Adolph's meat marinate, and put it on the smoker and cooked it.
sd	and then people think they're eating steak or something .
b^r	yeah.
sd	It really does.
sd	I don't usually just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because I just know I'll never take the time to do it.
b	Uh huh.
sd	it seems like most people like spaghetti.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well I think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference, in your whole house.
sd	It's usually friends from church and stuff,
sd(^q)	and it's usually kind of like, you want to come over, and they say well what can we bring.
sd	and everybody else brings something.
sd	I don't know if I could take the pressure of having to you know, put on this really fancy dinner for someone.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah
b	Yeah
qy	Do you work?
qy	Do you stay home with kids?
sd	and I'm not going to work anymore.
sd	and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night,
b^m	Eat at six, yeah.
ba	that's good.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other.
sd	but since it's just the two of us, it's ,
b	Yeah.
^2	to see what's happening.
b	uh huh.
sd	I've seen those in the magazines.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	we like that.
sv	that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too.
ba	neat.
ba	wow, that's great .
qw	How old is he?
ba	wow, that's good.
qy	Do like you cook a breakfast every morning
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sd	I've never tried it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
 b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Uh huh.
 b	Yeah
sd	so she would make these fancy casseroles and hide it in there, you know,
fp	Brian in Plano, Texas. How are you doing today?
sd	Great, Nancy.
sd	You're in Plano also,
sd^t	I was just talking to someone the other day from Pennsylvania.
qy	Really?
b^r	good to hear.
qw	Which one?
b	yeah.
sd	The Utah Jazz.
sv	They've got some good good, some good, good players out there.
qy	Well, you ready for New Year's Eve?
ad	Should we, start this so we can,
qw	What was your name again?
sd	Nancy, that's
sd	and I'm Brian.
sd^t	Okay Nancy, then I guess today's subject is benefits in the job other than salary.
qw	What, what do you feel are important to you or other people as crucial benefits?
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh .
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	to compensate for some of the benefits.
bk	Oh.
b	Yes.
qy^d	so actually that is a benefit,
b	Yeah.
sv	well I guess that's a good point,
sd	I think through our health insurance that I can get better rates through a group plan as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because I had to do that at one time when I wasn't employed with a large corporation
sd	so I I think one of the benefits I see is the group discount.
b	Yes.
sd	and that's one thing I do have.
sd	I don't think I would have insurance,
sd	and in my previous job, I really enjoyed because they had what was called flex schedule where I could go and I could work, nine hour days and have like Friday only work four hours
sd	or I could do, work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a, you know, three day weekend. And make my job flexible in that case.
sd	I mean because I was in a position of management I had responsibilities over people that, I needed to make my schedule, so that if I was not there I would have coverage by some other management personnel,
sd	so I think that, that was an excellent benefit that I really enjoyed
sv	and that's good.
qw	And, what other benefits do you think are important?
ba	that's true.
sv	Well, and that's an individual thing.
sd	and also a nice thing that we have in our corporation is a profit sharing plan where we can, participate in the profits of the company. you know, if we've been there a while and we're vested, which means that, you know, we have an interest, in the company that we can, get some of the benefits of either the profit high times or in a sense, suffer during the low times
sd^t	and I thought I'd make one tonight.
sd	That's what I did with mine, for a long time, put it on the handlebars so I can hang them up.
sd	And sometimes she just flops them all over the seat.
sd	I like it.
sd^e	it's just as boring.
na	I read a book while I'm doing it.
sd	But I was doing that on the exercise bike.
sd	I feel like I'm getting a little better of a workout, and I'm losing more weight on this than on the other.
sd	I was getting all dimpled up .
sd	And those are going away.
sv	So that's real good.
sd	We got it at a little bit of an incline.
sd	this is five hundred.
sd	I know they get cheaper.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I hope so.
sd	and we ski and swim in the summer
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I think, your voice sounds familiar.
qw	Where do you wo ,
sd^t	I wonder if we talked before.
sd	I'm in Garland.
sd^t	You sound like this girl that I talked to about books, and we got into movies one night.
b	Uh huh.
sd^t	education. Social changes that we've seen in the last ten, twenty, thirty years. Yeah,
sd^t	that one was.
sv^t	The most boring one was about what meal would you cook for a sit down dinner.
sd^t	The other woman didn't cook too much either.
sd^t	I talked to this old woman that was a retired administrator in Ohio one night about education.
 b	Uh huh,
 sd^t	and then a couple of weeks later I talked to the guy's roommate, in Virginia, about different things.
b	Uh huh.
no	I don't know.
qw^t	Well, how'd you find out about it?
qw^t	How did you find out about it?
nn	Uh huh.
sd	I have a friend that had a roommate that worked at T I
 sd^t	and she saw it on the computer screen and they made copies of it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh .
sd^t	But then on the letter it says cash or prize.
sd^t	This is going on my fourth week to do it.
ad^t	tell me.
ny	Yeah.
qy^t	Does it say?
b	Uh huh.
sd	He's telling me to start the grill.
qy^d^t	So it's not all stuff that T I makes.
bf	You mean the clocks.
 b	Yeah.
b	god.
qr^t	Did they mail that to you, or he brought it to you?
sd^t	so you're bound to find something you want.
b	Yeah.
qy^t	Well, do you know you have a ten minute time limit.
sd^t	and then they come on and they tell you got five seconds to say good bye.
sd^t	We'll keep talking if we want to come up with something else.
sd	we joined, ex.
sd	and they transferred it to another one that was really far away.
sd	it wasn't near me.
sd	and we'd end up just smoking cigarettes and riding around like we couldn't find the place .
sd	So my husband's just discouraged me on those things.
sd	And I got one of those Jane Fonda workout tapes that I dubbed from a friend.
sd	I had a baby, I think .
sd	Two.
sd	she's in college.
sd	So there's where the money goes.
qw	Where's you ki ,
bf	Two.
 qw	Where you going to school?
qw	And what are you doing?
b	Huh uh.
sv	The test is a booger. The test, the exit test.
aa	It's hard.
sv	It is so hard.
 b	Uh huh.
sd	See I didn't have to take any other exit test because I've been teaching for quite a while.
sd	But I've heard they're terrible.
sd	I've had friends fail that twice.
b	Good.
sv	right after you get out.
sd	most of the training I've got has been through Dallas just teaching E S L.
sv	Trying to find a jury so you can get a jury as far as, they may say they're not biased,
sv	so, I don't think it's such a bad idea to think about.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	Catches you off guard, doesn't it? .
b	Uh huh.
sv	I thought the sentencing was done by the judge.
sv	I mean, it's either guilty or not guilty.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	in certain cases I can see them going, just basically with a judge, guilty or not guilty verdict simply from a judge in highly publicized cases versus the small, maybe, you did a crime that was, burglary or whatever
sv	But when you get into these highly publicized cases where everybody knows details whether it's through the NATIONAL ENQUIRER or whatever.
sv	I'm not going to listen to the facts and con their way into, getting past the lawyers and getting through that.
sd	But I wonder if there is some big expense in trying to call a jury to trial and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if there's something that they have to pay.
sd	I know companies have to pay for these people to be off from work. Or at least give them the time off from work.
sd	If I remember, jury duty is with pay.
^2	Paid, right.
^2	Some that may decide not to.
qy	Did you want me to go ahead?
sd	and they took care of the family,
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean it doesn't bother him at all to do the dishes.
sv	But, men are starting,
sv	I think those men don't last very long in relationships because I think women know what they want.
aa	exactly.
sv	and I think that's even going to get better. Even, you know, even more so.
sd@	you can be whatever you want to be. Whether it be a welder or trucker or whatever . As long as you, go to school for it and get the education,
b	Uh huh.
aa	I do too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, emotionally I think, women do a little bit,
sv	 I know of some mothers that I guess I'd rather be with the father because the father is maybe more understanding, more, low key, more apt to be a better father than some mothers that I have seen that have been raised, you know, to develop whatever skills that they have,
sv	So, it may come down to where it's individual basis. Where everybody is treated an as individual, and not by sex.
sv	And it wouldn't matter if it's a woman or a man saying that.
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I don't know, if you've only got one,
qy	Do you or your husband work for T I,
ba	Well, that's neat.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	So, I've worked for them for several years, like twelve now, I guess.
sd	but, well, have you seen any movies recently?
bh	did you?
sd	I have a hard time with movies that are real long.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I've heard a lot of good things about it.
o@	Was it, my wife and I went and saw a couple of funny ones.
sd	We saw THE NAKED GUN, TWO AND A HALF
o	what was the spoof on TOP GUN,
sd	I was pretty disappointed in that one.
sd	we have small children, so we don't get to see too many, but we've seen I guess two or three movies this past summer.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Have you seen GHOSTS yet?
sd	I enjoyed that movie,
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I think,
b	Uh huh.
qy	SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?
sd^e	I did.
sd^e	I really enjoyed that a lot.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but really, I mean, when you stop and think about it, Anthony Perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie
sv	and yet it was his character that was so intriguing,
b	Yeah.
sd	I really did
aa	I agree with you.
fa	I'm sorry
sd	I always get those mixed up.
sd	that's not why I go
sv	and that one was.
qy	he didn't see it?
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
sd^e	I've seen it.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I guess, you know, as far as comedies go, probably my favorite is YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.
sd	I love that movie,
b	Yeah,
sd	but I'm a big, Mel Brooks fan
qy	He does?
qy	is that the one that's he's starring in?
sd	that came out, like early in the summer or something like that.
sd	I haven't seen that one either.
qy^d	BLAZING SADDLES.
 ny	uh huh.
sd	I like that one too, but I thought YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN was better.
sd	and sometimes I work on trumpet mouthpieces.
sd	and we cut out things, you know, and color and, use markers and things like that.
qo	how about you?
b	Uh huh.
aa	exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	my father is in the antique business.
sd	and he buys all kinds of, china and figurines and statues and stuff.
sd	It's called J B Weld
sd	It's an epoxy resin that you mix together.
sd	the hand's about the size of a cricket. And, has, like the forefinger sticking out and the thumb sticking out,
sd	It's kind of a ivory color all over and and, has some age spots in it,
sd	He had a blue bowl a few weeks ago that he fixed that way.
sd	And then, And and then he, he thatches, you know, those, thatched chairs.
sv	Course that's like that, hooking that you were talking about.
sv	That takes a lot of time.
sd	but I think he's stopped pretty much now.
sd	and I use, the graphics software on that, to do figures and to look at things, you know, see how they work.
b	Uh huh.
sd	we bought it at an, unfinished, furniture place and sanded it down and, stained it and then lacquered over it .
ny	yeah.
aa	sure is.
qy	did you use a Zar stain?
sd	it's Z, A R .
sd	if you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out.
sd	and it was all right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh
fc	Well, it was nice talking to you.
fc	you too.
sd	when the war was on I watched C N N and, NIGHTLINE pretty regularly and read the paper and all
qy	Have you been keeping up?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	There's no official document signed or anything?
sd	so I got out like my encyclopedias and tried to read about the history.
sv	there just hasn't been any peace over there ever . In thousands of years, of history.
sv	there isn't any real Arab coalition because they do fight among themselves.
sv	and they have such hatred for, Israel
 b	yeah.
sd	And got it over with.
sv	there's just no way for us to be involved over there and hope that there will be much peace.
sv	and I'm afraid that we would have to stay.
 b	Uh huh.
 b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
 b	Right.
 b	Right .
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	I'm not interested in keeping big military over there and having to go and call the shots like you say.
sd	And I just would prefer that, I mean sometimes we've said we're not interested in what other countries do.
sv	it was important demilitarize that area because of all the build up armaments.
sv	because we just don't want to send our people there and make them stay.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I don't think there's much hope for a lasting peace over there like they, expect. * Should utt 101 be included in this slash unit?
b	Yeah.
aa	No.
sd	I have a repairman just came, for my refrigerator,
fc	I hope you have a good day.
fc	Bye bye.
o	All righty.
qw	What type of home do you have in Dallas?
b	Uh huh.
ba	good .
qy^d	And it's probably typical of your neighborhood.
sd	I'm in Plano just, you know, north of where you live.
sd	And, we live near Coit and Legacy in a relatively new development that just has gone in about two years ago.
sd	and it's typical of the other homes in our neighborhood too.
ny	Yes.
sd	and then we had them level off our living room and dining room ceiling to, nine feet so we could get bedrooms above.
sd	but we don't have so much wasted space.
sd	And we could get more bedrooms per square foot that way.
ng	Mine are actually the lowest in the neighborhood.
ny	Yeah.
sd	it's over three fifty a month.
sd	just to air condition it,
sd	so, above the garage area I have a studio.
sd	and it, and it's the size of a three car garage.
sd	So, that's where I work.
aa^r	yes.
sd	and we just absolutely, love it.
sd	I just hope we never have to move again.
sd	Detroit this last time.
sd	We were there two years
sd	we love it.
sd^e	and they're much, much better constructed down south than they are up north too.
sv@	Up north they just kind of throw them together. Because we had homes built in Detroit also,
sd	If the trim work didn't line up that's just what you get .
b	Oh.
sd	and you know, they seemed so proud of everything they did.
sd	And it really made a difference to us.
b	Yes.
b	Oh.
b	Yes.
sv	That's important too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah,
sd	ours is pretty much level in the two years ,
sd	but I don't know with the E D S building and Penny's and everything going in up on Legacy, we're hoping that brings in more people.
 sd	That's what we're hoping because, we're just real close to where that is.
 b	Uh huh.
 sd	I hope so too.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah.
sv	For that reason it can stay the same,
sd	but , But we love being where we are.
o	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Hm .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ba	that's a good idea.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's good.
sd	and we recycle paper.
sd	and, you know, we recycle old aluminum cans and all that kind of stuff.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	and then we get money for that.
sd^e	you know, we just keep it with the dorm.
sd	and then we buy, like, cooking equipment and stuff.
sd	and whatever the dorm would want, that's what we buy.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
nn	No.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Is that what this target is,
nn	No.
b	Huh uh.
b	Oh.
sd	I don't really know any other recycling that they do.
sd	We have to take it to a recycling place.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd	I didn't know that.
sd	I never heard of that .
no	not that I know of .
nn	No.
ba	my gosh.
sd	and then you get money for your aluminum cans.
sd	But I know they're going to start now.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah
sd	Well, that's all I really know about recycling.
bh	really?
na	We have Kroger, but not a Skaggs.
b	Oh.
na	You guys are getting into it more than we are.
sd	if you have grocery bags you can take them and use them instead of getting new ones.
sd^e	but we don't have any place that collects the grocery bags.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my.
sd	I'm a finance major.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
 qw	What do you think the outcome will be?
ny	Yeah
sd	we've had one as long as I can remember .
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I can't think of anything on recycling.
nn	No.
qy^r	What do we think about them?
 h	I don't know .
qo	what you think about Pennsylvanians.
b	really .
sd	I really don't know anyone from Texas or anything.
sd	I've never been there,
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
qy	is it like a foreign exchange type student?
sd	the only work I do outside the home is I am an Avon representative.
sd	And I sell family products.
 qy	Do you work outside?
bk	uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, you'd have to dress differently when you're working every day, I think.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	so what I wear depends on the weather.
sd	so I know a lot of the Avon representatives are portrayed as being very dressed up.
sd	But, I try to dress nice, but for convenience, because when the weather's bad, when I go into the home I take off my shoes which I try to wear something easy to take off, you know and put on.
sd@	so, I really don't have to dress up like you would, like if you're in an office or something. well, not actually because we really only have maybe three, four months of, I'd say warm weather.
sd^e	and the rest gets into the cooler weather.
h	so I don't know.
sd	But for now, But for now, we have a lot of ice and snow in the wintertime and, cold weather. And that type of thing.
sv	I think, you know, you have to spend more money on your clothing, and that because you do have to have a good appearance to do a good job where you work.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
qrr	or did you did they wear more dresses and skirts.
b^m	No slacks.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Not even a dressy slack suit even if it's all,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I don't think she ever wears slacks to work.
sd	But I didn't know if the trend changes, you know, if,
sv	Look more like a woman, .
b^r	uh huh.
sv	well, then you, you know why they make them then , that way.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	But, yet, you need to keep up an appearance for your husband, too, though at home. Because that's, I believe,
sd	Well, you'll be excused because considering everything .
sd	But I look at homemaking as a job also. being a homemaker
sv	and I think sometimes we lose sight of that. by the fact that we don't sometimes watch our dress,
o	Okay .
sv	and I think we've even gone into more the labor aspect of it also. With the pay and everything, you know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah.
 b	Uh huh.
sd	She never really had a chance to work.
sd	She doesn't believe in the woman working unless she has to.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	that's increasing more unemployment for people that need to work. You know, like for the men that don't have jobs,
sd	you know, she feels if there is women out there just because they want to do it, she said, you know, they could stay at home,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qo	} what do you think about the women that are not having families because they want to continue their business?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
sv	Or they won't be as good as they could be.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my.
o	Bless you .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I agree.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And they just enjoyed the income, the extra.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
ba	I know .
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	see, now, my parents, there is no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college.
sd	and I think that's right
sd	I mean I tell them I pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor, you know.
sv	Well, if they do, they don't know it, you know .
ba	I know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and with the abortion, I don't think there is going to be as many abortions, but I don't know what women will do when they get into politics, you know, about abortion.
sv	I think it will be freedom of choice.
aa	Exactly, yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd@	I think if a woman would get into politics or enough women get into politics, I think it will definitely be freedom of choice. Uh huh.
sd	and we are not supposed to, you know, say that that's okay, but I really feel that it's freedom of choice.
sd^r	I do.
sv	And different circumstances call for different things.
qy^d^t	I guess you heard our topic for today was clothing?
sd^t	How you dress for work and season to season and everything.
qw	How do you dress for work?
b	Sure.
ba	You bet.
sv	Look professional .
sd	and I am very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt and things like that
sd	but then when I travel it is a little different situation.
sd@	suits and sports coat, tie and the whole bit. Cause you go to meetings and you are required to look your best and look professional of course.
sv	I think in today's society, there is more credibility to be quite honest
sd	my first job years ago, thirty years ago, twenty nine years ago, in fact, was selling agricultural fertilizer.
sd	and I sold you know, manure.
sd	but I was calling on guys that wore bib overalls.
sd	and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional
sd	and he sort of expected me to dress as a professional
sd	so, it was sort of,
na	You bet even back then
sd	so I been aware of my dress ever since then and try to look my best,
sd	but here again I dress casual quite a bit
sd	If I call on just, a normal little dealer of mine, I might be casual.
sd	So it depends.
nn	probably no.
nn^r@	Probably, no. Because, today I believe you can get away with,
sv	you like your minister standing up in front of you with no tie, he would be missing something.
sv	Although, he shouldn't be evaluated on that.
sd	So, its' just different.
sv	it is.
sv	I guess that has changed also.
b	Right.
b	Sure.
sd	so I understand what you are saying there
ba^r	and it's a very good point.
sv(^q)	But what's the old saying, you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.
sv	I think you have to dress sort of accordingly.
sv	But, you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and, or evaluate a person by that.
qy^d	I guess your dress changes.
 qy	Can I guess your favorite team, if you had one, might be the Steelers.
sd	you know, I kind of like the Cowboys, too.
na	They've had some great games in the past.
sd	He lives in the Dallas area now, as a matter of fact.
sd	He bought a big horse farm out in a little town called Roanoke, Texas.
sd	As a matter of fact, there was some talk about trying to get him involved with the team management in some sort of a coaching job.
sv	He's such a motivator, primarily, you know, with the quarterbacks.
sd^r	I really do.
sv	That would be really great.
sv	and in the earlier years they really had some super teams.
sv	he's very good.
sv^r	He's very good.
sv	there are very few Black quarterbacks, or at least that are starting anyway.
qy	You have any idea.
b	Uh huh.
sv	that was just such super team.
sv^r	it really would.
qy^d	They have such a super team for years, that won what, four Super Bowls?
sd	I don't know if that could ever be duplicated again or not.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's right .
ba	That's right.
h	I don't know.
sv	they had such a super team.
qy	Have you been following the big draft that occurred yesterday?
bk	I see.
sv	it really is.
sd	They may get hurt, or, not be able to participate at that level, if you know,
qy	Ever been?
 sd	He used to play for the New York Giants.
 sd	That was one of the toughest guys that I've ever seen in my life, as far as, you know, dedication.
 sv	He just went all out every single play.
sv	there's been so many.
sd	But if I had to pick one, I would probably pick Sam Huff, as a matter of fact.
b	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv^r	he is,
sv	of course a quarterback has a big ego.
sv	they can't survive.
sv	They always think they can win, you know, which is the way it should be.
sd	Boy, he never gave up, I'll tell you.
b^r	uh huh,
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	they really were.
sd	highlights, yeah.
sv	well they make mistakes too, I guess.
b	Uh huh,
sv	it's just a matter of how hard, you know, or where.
sv^r	they really do.
sv	he's about a half hot head anyway, such a temper.
b	Uh huh.
sv	obviously not very fast.
sv	but, he has a terrible weight problem.
sd	they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not, you know, completely out of control.
sv	But I guess most every team has someone like that,
sv	Absolutely they get bigger and bigger, it seems every year.
sv	I guess you have to, you know, to stay in the game I guess.
b	Yeah.
sv	well, or I would have to say, you know, someone like Montana, I guess, who's done so well for so many years.
sv	He's no Spring chicken anymore.
sv	But he's very exciting to watch.
b	sure.
 aa	absolutely.
sd	I never was, you know, a big fan, you know.
sv	but he's a very young fellow.
sv	of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a good supporting cast, you know.
sv	hopefully they'll do better this year.
sv	Miami's had some down years, too.
sv@	it's cyclical, I guess. As the players get older, get slower.
b	Yeah,
aa	yes, very much so.
^2	Hip injuries and things like that, yeah.
sv	that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game.
ba	That's right.
sv	So when you think about it, that's really not a very long time, of course.
sd	But if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don't make it seven years, you know.
ba@	That's right, yeah, * should this be two slash units?
sv	that's a pretty short career on average.
sv	Of course they play their, you know, cards right and do some good investments, you know, they'll do all right.
sv	But a lot of them don't, unfortunately.
h	I don't know.
sv	They've had some excellent teams, though, obviously.
qw	What is your opinion?
bf	You say yes.
sd	I have heard someone else, say that, the Canadian health insurance is absolutely excellent
sv	This is evidently this is one of the ways that they're paying for the program plus discouraging the people to quit smoking so they don't have to pay out as many, benefits on like lung cancer and things like this.
b	Yeah,
ba	my word, Lynn.
ba	That's horrible.
sd	Well, we're fortunate in that so far, knock on wood, most of us have been real healthy
sd	so we don't have a lot of medical bills.
sd	but what worries me is the fact that I don't like the government telling me who I can see and who I can't see.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Are they?
sd	Well, I know that James had it.
br	I beg your pardon.
sd	and she was on that Kaiser Permanente
sd	she would have had to wait like two months to get the doctor she wanted.
sv	But then again, I guess you can even do that in McCullum.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and that still goes on.
b	Uh huh.
qh	More and more taxes? .
sv	I know that it's getting to the point that the insurance doesn't pay that much on catastrophic illnesses.
sd	They don't pay anything on, implants or transplants,
sd	and the average person can't afford, you know, a heart or a kidney on just their own.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Good grief.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	that's helped bunches
qy^d	or wonder if they're wanting it.
qw	So what movies have you seen?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I saw DANCES WITH WOLVES and, HOME ALONE
sd	It is.
sd	It is about a little kid that his parents go off to Paris.
sd	they take a head count and the oldest daughter counts one of the neighbor kids instead of,
sd	And he is up in the attic asleep because he got in trouble.
sd	So she made him go sleep upstairs.
sd	And there is, there is a couple of burglars, breaking into the houses in the neighborhood.
sd	And he sets up traps for them all over the house.
 sd	he does.
b	Uh huh.
 %	But,
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, like, in the early eighties or during the, like the SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT era.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	And it was shocking at the end too.
b	Yeah.
ba	That is right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Especially JAWS.
 b	Uh huh.
 b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Just more of the same.
 sd	In one of them they have a mother shark, destroy a whole, marina and aquarium.
 +	Which is kind of far fetched.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	They hardly ever play music when a shark attacks somebody.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
 sd	Well, every once in a while, I go, but it has to be like somebody that I like
sd	you know. I did not go see FIELD OF DREAMS when it was in the theatre because I did not know it was any good.
 %	then I,
sd	And then I really liked it.
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	when the anniversary came up
sd	that was around the time of anniversary, you know.
sd	And then it was on the news.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	And I wondered who it was too.
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	INVISIBLE MAN?
 nn	Huh uh.
qy	did they make the movies after that
b	Uh huh.
 b	Right.
aa	yeah.
fc	It was n , Nice talking to you.
qw	What do you like to watch on television ?
b	Yes .
sd	and I think our favorite night is, Monday night,
sd	and we start out with EVENING SHADE and MAJOR DAD,
sd	and I think that's the one night that we really try to watch television.
sd	You know my husband's always got it on.
sd	I'm not always sitting down,
sv	I love all those, that two hours
qy	did you watch did you watch it?
sd	and I like, U S A, when they had their, mystery movies and things, their made for T V movies
qy	Do you watch it much?
b	Yes.
sd	Now we haven't watched any of those.
sd	now we have watched some things on that.
sd	and, you know, there's this surgery going on as we're eating our dinner you know,
sd(^q)	and I'm saying let's move right on .
sd	But our grandchildren like that Discovery Channel if they're over here, because lots of times it will have things on, animals
sd	and they just thoroughly, you know, enjoy that
sd	in fact, I think they were watching something on, whales, or killer sharks, one or the other couple of weeks ago over here
sd	and, so we have watched that
sd	and, otherwise, of course my husband's into the football
sd	and, you know, I will watch that some if I'm reading or doing something else, you know with him.
qh	but do we have to carry this on into the summer and the spring you know, all of that,
sd	He's ten
sd	but, and we very seldom watch television on a Friday night or Saturday night, because we're not home
qy	do you ever watch that?
ny	uh huh
^2	that are sometimes so dumb .
qy	Are you a T I er?
bk	good.
sd	I thought, well all these T I ers have gone home, at one o'clock on Friday.
sd	I kind of worked my way through college as a mechanic as a kid.
sd	but in the last ten years my car doesn't go to a shop, you know,
sd	I did take it to a transmission place to put in a new transmission but, I change the oil and transmission
sd	But I do it for fun really and to save money.
sv	Like I think Sears is probably the best place
sd	because, I've heard, when I used to go there and when I,
sd	But what I heard them tell other people was always right.
sd	You know, when I sat there, you know, I dropped my car off for tires or something like that.
 sd	they seem to actually have mechanics there.
sd	And when when I did it the next time, I realized the filter was loose and everything,
sd	So I'm just doing it all myself.
sv	You had to do it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	Well, you like Fords, apparently, huh?
b	Yeah.
bh	Really?
 ba	My goodness.
 sd	I always wonder when you have little things like that happen, we don't inspect, I'm in facilities, } why we don't inspect areas and guarantee it so to speak.
sv	There ought to be an inspector or quality insurance guy after an oil change, you know.
sv	Just in case, they didn't put the oil in or whatever.
sd	I always wonder about that when someone does repairs or little things like that,
b	Yeah.
sd^r	I don't either,
sd	I think I do most of the things better than the average person.
sd	you have Fords and I, I have three Chevys,
sd	I don't know how long I'm,
sd	And I'm, sold on small block Chevy V eights.
sd	And I, I bought one car new,
sd	and I almost accidentally got the next car, although I was kind of looking for it when I got a used car with the same engine.
sd	So I buy filters, you know, three or four at a time.
sd	And essentially the engines are different
sd	the cars are different years, but the same Chevy V eight.
sd	the course is two are eighties and one eighty six, you know.
sd	there's no way I could fix every car in the world, you know.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think they're all bad, really.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Is that right?
qw	What did they want to charge you for it?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
^q	This is your little water, heater in there, for the, the heat inside?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	But it came out from you know, underneath the hood.
sd	It came from,
ny	Yeah.
sd	it's been a long time since I took one out.
sd	so I'm always very careful when I change hoses on it.
sd	I, when I take those hoses, I cut them off very gingerly.
sd	and I've always done that as a kid, you know, just yanked on it.
sd	And they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time.
sd	and I thought, well I'm going to carefully take those hoses off.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	My wife's, Chevy, it was a Caprice, air conditioning stopped.
sd	I realized that the air conditioning wasn't cutting in.
sd	it's not the evaporator, the big filter on one side.
sd	I just pushed that in, and I heard it click.
sv	you could have taken something like that and thought, well, the compressor's not working. Or it would have taken me all day probably if I didn't do that. But sometimes you have some dumb luck. If you have a little curiosity and you have enough knowledge to check things out.
sv	And I know that's tough if you don't, at least give it a shot.
sd	and, I feel bad about not at least showing them some of the things.
sd(^q)	I said, So you can learn the basics, you know.
b	Yeah.
qw	what kind of music do you like?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	sometimes I'll listen to jazz,
sd	I also like the, the classic rock stations, that play the older, more mellow type rock music .
sv	and, sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating
 x	,
sd	and I just get kind of tired of all that.
sd	I guess, I don't like hard rock.
sd	I have some rock and some jazz and a couple, maybe one or two country and western. Some, I can't believe I can't think of his name. Garth Brooks,
 sd	And, but it's mainly just the light rock type stuff.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	because I have so many albums and cassettes I feel like, gosh, I'm going to have to go out and buy a C D player and then start collecting C D s,
sd	I haven't gotten around to doing it yet.
b^r	yeah.
sd	Just like V C R's, too .
sd	and I can do without it for a while.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
sd	right now, I think. They're somewhere between ten and fifteen dollars a piece.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I thought, my gosh,
sd	now I know another reason why I'm not going to get a C D player for a while.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	so I can record off other cassettes.
sd	I don't have one
sv	Now you know, one of these days when I get a new car, maybe, I guess all of them will probably have C D s players by then,
sd	I just got mine paid off .
sd	and she's got the cassette, so she can record I mean, I'm sorry, o , other way around, off C D s onto cassettes.
 sd	but but, I just haven't gone to C D yet.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And they get worse and worse, too.
sd	Well, that's amazing how when I was in college, I used to have the stereo on all the time or I had on M T V or something,
sd	I'll turn that on while I'm in the shower and while I'm getting ready because there's really not much else I can do
sd	and, and then I listen to it when I'm in the car driving to work because, again, you know, there's nothing else going on.
 sd	I might as well listen to the radio while I'm driving to work.
sd	I just don't bother to do it very much anymore.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	What instrument does he play?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've never heard of that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	my parents had me take piano lessons for eight years,
sd	I could sit back down and play a few things, but not like I used to be able to.
sv	It's kind of sad that I've let that slip away.
 qw	What kind of pet do you have, Gail?
bk	you have children .
qy	Have you?
qw	what have you had?
b	Oh.
sv	Well, you're going to have lots of pets with your children growing up.
sd	And we do have a very loving cat that's, you know, kind of our baby.
sd	and that's because they have a Great Dane .
sd	They're just huge .
b	yes.
sd	that's why we've never gotten a female, you know, in anything.
sd	and our male cats, you know, we had,
sd	He's still out partying.
 sd	But, you know I do think that maybe we'll get a female next time and just have her spayed, you know.
sd	It just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved
sd	and, that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap.
sd	But it was like he knew you know,
sd	and so he was a lot of company to her. You know, and,
sd	And when everybody turned we all four of us turned in a row .
b	Uh huh.
qy	Did he? .
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I think that's one of the things that both of us are not wanting to start over with, you know.
sd	and, you know, it just really, you know, upset me no end.
b	Oh .
b	Uh huh.
sd	and you grieve just as much over them when they go you know, as you would a child.
qy	Any vacations recently that you would highly recommend?
bh	really?
ba	wow.
qw	what, has been your favorite trip do you think?
qy	Really?
qy	Better than Europe?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I am from Denver
sd	and then we had to write, reports about it during our vacation. which, was really fun.
sd	 and, it had sparked an interest of mine,
sd	That is what she had originally gone to school to do. Was photography
sd	so we are hoping not soon, maybe within the next ten years to get to take a trip over to Europe and take, a trip from the northern portion of France down to the southern tip of Spain, and follow.
sd	It is kind of a backward S shape, trail that the pilgrims use to take, in, back in the medieval times, to see the relics, in, southern Spain and in Italy
sd	and so we would like to take pictures of the gothic and Romanesque monasteries and, just take that journey all the way down and then right a book about it.
sd	it would be
sd	it is our big dream.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	sure.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Wow.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b^r	yeah.
qy^d	You said that you have been to England several times?
sd	It is called, Bemerton?
b	Okay.
o	Okay, Ron.
ad^t	and might you say what kind of cars you have and so forth.
ba	My goodness gracious that's,
qy^g	Well, that's still not enough for a total, is it.
qy	and do you buy one every two years?
b	Uh huh.
qrr	or just are there normal safety belts in it, that you had.
qy	Did that help you?
qy^d	They didn't go off.
qy^g	But you were hit in the side, weren't you?
sd	you may, you may need to be hit leaning towards the forward to activate it.
ba	My goodness.
b	Uh huh.
ba	My goodness.
sv	This doesn't sound like you've got very good luck with that one.
 +	realize that they don't have to drive that way here.
sd	and I find that the most of the repairs I have to do here is body damage due to the salt that we have to put on the road to, take care of us in the winter time.
sd	and once in a while we have to replace some of the plates in the bottom of it because it's rusted away.
sd	Well, I di , I had this Cougar the body of it, totally rebuilt, to get some of the rusts that were in the fenders done, and then it all repainted,
qrr	or you going lease it again?
bh	Are you?
b	Uh huh.
qy	isn't it too large for normal town driving, finding parking places and getting in and out the doors?
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, that certainly would be a wonderful, comfortable machine to take on long trips
sd	I'm very much aware of that.
sd	I'm sure it is, because that's the way that I enjoy this Pontiac that I have.
sd	but it's very quiet and very smooth riding machine.
qo	So, what do you think about a year or two of public service?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I spent a year teaching there
sd	and I think it was probably one of my largest eye opening experiences because I come from nice middle class white suburban home
sd	so I wanted to stay close to where I was working on a masters degree, but also because I just thought that it would be interesting to live some place else so totally different than my own up bringing
sd	it changed my understanding of the world around me
sd	after that, you know, you never think of it I guess because I paid for all of my college education myself, I never thought about doing that because I had all these college loans I'd started paying back.
sd	but now that I'm further along, and I'm still paying these college loans, I think realistically, you know, you can have your college loans delayed now, because I had them delayed because I'm back in graduate school at thirty years old,
qy	I probably would have done, you know, just like, is this, is that the Mormon church, that does that?
sd	Because one of my neighbors, did that in Pittsburgh, from Pittsburgh.
sd	probably like you said, to be able to travel some place else whether it be the United States or outside the country, I think it would have been a very good, experience for me.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I think I was paid, about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year
sd	and I, one of the things I taught was a computer class
sd	and these kids, you know, every girl I taught, except for one, was pregnant.
sd	and they were high school juniors.
sd	and I think, you know, in the sense, that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities for, just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical, things, I think it's a really good idea. And even if it is overseas.
sd	I tell you sometimes I worry about things over seas because we have such problems right here in our own country.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know that my first couple of years of college were, probably too carefree at the, beginning
sd	and then at the end I had to be too serious.
b	Uh huh.
sv^t	I think this was a very interesting topic because it's something that, you know, we don't talk about in this country probably enough.
ba	that's true.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I spend a lot of my time teaching college students
sd	and, I find great disgust in them, in their, their self centeredness and their inability to understand, multicultural or multiracial situation
sd^r	they don't understand,
sd	I think that's, just having a good time.
sd	I guess he's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it, you know,
sv	today's young people are short term pleasure oriented,
sv	and it has to be fun.
b	Yeah.
sd	I think I, have read recently that, the Bush Administration has increased the funding for the Peace Corps.
sd	I guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense, you known,
sd	and some of the are the overseas programs.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's true.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I guess, I live near Washington, being in Baltimore, it's something like one in four people, in the Washington, area, are lawyers,
sv	and I just sort of think that's ridiculous.
sv	with with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and, you know, the problems we have with AIDS and cancer and how come everybody is a lawyer, you know, you know ,
ba	Right.
sv	you saw, statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run.
ba	that's true.
ba	That's interesting. Uh huh.
fc	thanks so much for the conversation.
fc	Bye bye.
qh	So Ken, how do you do your family budget?
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	yeah.
b	Huh uh.
qy^2	Well, then you just pay it off at the end of the month?
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
ba	That's a real good idea.
sd	I put in so much money, each, you know, month towards long term savings, you know, like in, mutual funds and things, you know,
sd	Maybe after awhile I'll rub off on her or something .
b	Yeah.
b@	Huh uh. Yeah.
sd	So am I.
sd	I'm a voice researcher.
b	Huh uh.
sd	So does mine.
b	Huh uh.
sd	but she saved enough maybe to get her through August.
sd	It doesn't work, Ken .
sd	so we don't.
sd	But, you know, there goes my savings .
sd	But, you know, it's one of those things.
sd	Now, see my wife will do things like make clothes.
sd	and she's already made, you know, presents and gifts and things for, shorts for me and things for the summer.
sd	but, but, she does have things where she likes to pamper herself that just to me seem like money dumped down a drain. You know.
b	Yeah.
sv	You know, but you need a hobby.
ba	That's true.
sd	I guess she just stopped polishing them because they were yellow.
fe	, my gosh,
sd	And lotion, my goodness, body lotion,
sd	must spend more on one application of body lotion than I do on soap for an entire year.
sv	It's funny.
sd	That's true.
sd	maybe after we're not in school anymore, we'll be much better at saving.
sd	And that's what's really paying for my time unemployed or whatever. Because the ten thousand dollars in tuition, really doesn't cover living expenses.
sd	we're paying double rent, double utilities,
sd	She doesn't live within her professional income, you know.
sd	so it gets tough,
sd	You know, it will cut our telephone bills, you know, by four fifths, you know, if she's here,
sd	so hopefully our budget will in increase then.
sd	Just since December.
sd	and they're about the same ,
sd	And I was like, well, that's true my dad never said a word, you know.
b	Yeah.
sd	must be cringes or something, you know,
sd(^q)	and I was like, oh.
bh	What else can you say?
sd	I think that's probably a really good idea.
b	Huh uh.
sd	and one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage, and the food bills
sd	for savings , I'll have to look into that.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	really, because of the heavy ice.
sd	It broke the limbs.
b	Huh uh.
b	Right.
b	Huh uh.
^q	What happens if something happens to a car, you know.
sd	If I get busy I don't get a chance to pick it up, like this week I noticed several copies haven't been touched
sd	and if they, go out to play or something I like to keep my eye on them so I'll, you know, maybe go outside and read the paper while they're playing or sit in a chair by the window or something.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I can hear the news, not have to sit right down and listen to it.
sd	and so, I do try to keep that in mind that whenever you're reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I would really say that that's not true, because it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain candidates,
sv	but you'll have a variety to choose from.
qy	Do you ever listen to the radio
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	I don't.
sd	I really, have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of, even music
sd	and and then I'll know to keep an eye out for it,
sd	but I've got out of the habit of listening to the radio.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
qy	Do you have a particular local channel that you watch?
b	Uh huh.
sd	and so we're still shopping , for a favorite channel.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I like the anchors to be different kinds of people.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, I prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because I think you're more likely to get,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Yeah.
 b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
sd	it's just we haven't found one that we've snuggled into.
sd	I guess because you get use to, you like the anchors,
b	and,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's true.
sv	So that really effects how they report the news.
qy	Is he the sports,
ad	I guess it is time to close now, so I can run go help put the kids to bed.
fc	Yeah.
qw	what kind of books do you like to read, for enjoyment?
b	Uh huh
qw^r	What kind of business is it?
bk	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's interesting.
br^m	A what?
bh	really?
sv	it's like, life is to interesting to read fiction
sd	I have a real heart for people involved in cults
sd	but, and I have a neighbor with a big motorbike
qy	so. Do you enjoy reading anything like that?
b	Uh huh.
br	Thirty or younger, Is that what you said?
ba	that's funny.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
sd	but, anyway, . I did read one chapter of that .
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	I haven't.
b	Uh huh.
qw	What's the name of it again?
br^m	LIFE EXTENSIONS?
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
sd	and I know my husband's uncle owns some acreage in, Eastland, Texas, which is in West Texas,
sd	and he owns a lot of acreage that's been farmed properly, you know
o@	you know, and , I guess I'm going to have to wait for the millennium, I think though because I don't think we're going to restore the earth to,
qy	you know what I'm saying?
sd	you know, and try and do what I can do out of it that's practical,
o@	but, anyway,
b	Uh huh
b	Uh huh.
br^m	Because it's what?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
b	Uh huh
bh	Really?
sd	but it's three or four times deeper than it needed to be,
sd	and so they have probably half an acre,
qy	Would that be healthier to do that, to drill your own fresh water well like that?
qw	What's most important to you?
b	Right.
sd	now I don't have that, although I do have a pension that I'm drawing from them which, thank God, I had.
sd	But, man, I think those medical benefits are the most important.
sv	so you might as well not even go .
sd	so mine was being put into like a trust fund, you know.
sd	but I don't know if they ever got anything or if they lost all of theirs
sd	I really feel sorry for all those people that spent all that time there, you know.
qw	what company do you work for?
b	uh huh.
nn	No.
qy^d	You probably heard of that .
bh	does she really?
ba	how about that.
sd	Well, you did.
sd	Well Ryder and P I E went together you know,
sd	and then that ended it .
sv	when P I E and Ryder went together, why that was downhill from then on, you know.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	We could do that for eighteen months.
sv@	God, that's terrible. You know.
sv	but anyhow, and jobs aren't that hard to find, to get another one that does pay your benefits, you know.
sv	if you do get a job, they don't pay benefits.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	and they're lifting refrigerators into trucks and and everything else, you know.
sd	So I don't know what's happening and what's going to happen.
qw	who do you work with at this time?
ba	All right.
ba	My goodness.
aa	I guess you do.
qw	what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you, other than their present salary?
b	uh huh.
bf	because , they have a specific reason to do so, because they themselves benefit from doing a better job.
^2	And it's a contribution.
sv	You can't stand in front of a counter and do that kind of stuff all day and feel like that you're contributing something to a scientific level of knowledge or so forth.
b^m	You're a financial planning firm?
qw	How many,
b	Uh huh,
qw	Well, what changes have you considered, in doing it, to your company, that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better?
qy	When you say bring in, do you mean that they negotiated with people to come in and, ask for your support?
sv	Even though they didn't bring it in, they help it once it's there.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but it might be whether the locality there, those people want that kind of support.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's true.
sd	but, for me to try to get it now, it would cost me like over three hundred dollars a month with the same company that was providing health insurance at P I E.
sv	God, the government should come up with some kind of a health plan, or stop these doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high.
sv	Well, the thing is, you know, jobs are so hard to find you know,
sd	No benefits, you know.
aa	Yes.
sd	I mean, you get a job now, and the wages are really low
sv	so you just, you know, pray to God that you don't get sick.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I don't understand that either.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	then I just sent cards in
sd	and then } they would just send me a check for what was ever over that, you know.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
aa	that's true there.
aa	right.
sv	people that's on unemployment.
sd	so, it's kind of hard, you know,
sv	they'll be calling at my door,
sv	now I do think the government, though, is going to have to do something, with this problem, because, you know, even to go to a little doctor out here, just to ask him anything, costs you forty bucks you know, just for the visit.
sv	and then } that's another forty bucks, plus whatever else he decides to do to you,
qw@	Well what movie have you seen? Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It's one of my favorite even,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	uh huh.
ba	Good.
qy	is he young?
sd	that makes sense.
sd	Well, my kids' very favorite, and yours may be too young for it, was HOME ALONE.
sd	They think they're so cute.
sd	but we did try to go see about a month ago that, DEAD AGAIN that black and white one,
sd	and we couldn't run it back
fa	And I'm sorry .
sd	We're just not real big movie goers.
sd	Well, that's us too
sd^r	that's us too.
aa	I thought that was cute, too.
sd	and he wants to see that
sv	I thought the funny part in HOME ALONE that's good for kids, is kind of coming up with how they can deal with problems on their own without panicking
sd	and he's terribly rich by now.
aa	me too .
aa	That's right.
b	That's right.
sd	AWAKENING, is supposed to be wonderful.
sd^r	AWAKENING is supposed to be wonderful
sd(^q)	and she said that was an excellent movie.
b^r	Yes.
sd(^q)	and we have some doctors at church who said that DOCTOR was just wonderful.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS
qy	did you all ever think about purchasing that one, when it comes out?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	I understand that, too.
sd	I think with the rebate you could get it for nine dollars
sv	you could rent it more than onc , more than four times and watch that.
aa	Well, I understand I understand,
b	of course.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	sweet .
^2	But that's, in her plans.
sv	Well, it's hard to find a movie any more these days that you can take your kids
sd	we rented ADVENTURES IN BABY SITTING thinking that would be so cute,
sd	but the language in it is just for no reason, has to stick in,
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, you watch, it differently when your kids are in the room, you know
sd(^q)	and they go, I know, Mommy, I know.
sv	it's a little different, because you see things from a different different angle.
sd	we rented Chevy Chase and that FAMILY VACATION.
sd	And those are just absolutely hilarious
sd	We had to fast forward through a whole lot of it for them to see it .
qy	do you participate in family reunions?
qy	were they close?
b	Uh huh.
ba	how neat.
b	Uh huh.
sd	that would be fun.
sd	but now we hold it at, Lake Texoma so that the Oklahoma group doesn't have to drive as far.
sd	and we've had as many on a, Saturday night as about two hundred and fifty.
b	Uh huh.
sd	our family all brought in food and everything.
sd	and we go get Kentucky Fried Chicken and bring out.
sd	and just love that they have all this little batch of cousins that they get to see about once a year
sd	and our children, you know, thoroughly enjoy it.
sd	Now I'm to the mother was
sd	and, I am, now the older generation and doing more of the cooking and watching my daughter you know, more and everything,
ba	my word.
b	uh huh.
bh	are they?
^2	Get together any more.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	and as, as parents get older and start dying off, I think sometimes it is hard to keep the interest going.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	you probably do good just to get your immediate family together.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and we have three grandchildren
sd	but our daughter is really interested.
br	I beg you pardon?
sd	I wish that our son was you know,
sd	and he's newly married and doesn't have children
sd	and, you know, I'm hoping, that as they, you know, are, married a little bit longer and have children that they may be more inclined to want to go, you know, to it,
sd	I know that.
sd	Now when he was a preteen, you know, when he was like ten or twelve he loved going,
sd	and this is more country western group
sv	and that might be the solution .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	and I do believe there must have been some sort of quota system because, I know a lot of people that in a sense, not, qualified is the wrong word, certainly were deserving to come.
sd	or there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether they would be able to come .
sv	And so I would guess that, you know, there are quotas for different places.
sd	or, I'm not sure what the terminology is.
sv	Maybe political a ,
aa	You got the term.
o@	But, Yeah,
sd	I guess I haven't been in a situation where it's been threatening to me.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	but they just maybe work harder
b^r	right.
sv	but maybe part of that's the problem that here we've let this value slip.
sv	And they need to have some competition.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, that's too bad.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	that's really sad.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	there is too big of a concentration coming all at once to allow for adequate melting into the society.
aa	Right.
aa	Exactly.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right,
b	Right.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	Well, I guess, I don't have much, much more to contribute to the topic.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Goal directed.
bf^r	Goal directed.
ba	I see.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	sure.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
ny	Yes,
sd	Up in the Gaithersburg area.
b	Uh huh.
sv@	I think as I recall in my son's class, there were an awful lot of minorities. And, of all varieties.
sd	I guess I wasn't involved enough to, really stop to think about it.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	right.
fc	Well, it was good talking to you.
fc	And have a good weekend.
fc	all righty,
sd@	Of a exercise program you have. Right.
sv@	Well, swimming is, one of the best exercises you can do. I mean as far as for, cardiovascular
sd	and and it's least hard on your body,
sd^r	It's the least hard on your body as far as, impact
aa	right.
sd	boy if I go, in the summer time I try to jog a couple of miles
sd	and, well, you know, even doing that three or four times a week, when summer hits, that's a hard thing to go out and and go jogging for, half hour or so,
sd	but so, I'm not quite getting the level that I need to.
na	I like it.
sd	so, to do a whole lot just requires a lot of, coordination as far as scheduling and that type of, deal, you know,
sv	Of course, you got a little different direction going,
^2	you don't notice it as much,
qy^g	You feel it, don't you?
sd	And things don't fit just quite exactly fit the same.
qy^d	there, probably quite a few facilities.
^2	If you can find the time it's just the.
sd	it is hard
sv	It's, like anything else whether or not you want to sacrifice another half hour.
sd	My problem is I don't want to wake up another half hour earlier and do more .
^g	right
sv	as soon as you do it, it's really a release.
sv	and you feel you feel in a lot better shape just like eating right foods.
sd	If I eat very much sugar, boy, just does something.
sd	I have to be real careful.
^g	Did you?
qy^d	Makes a lot of difference.
sd	Well, there's a lot of fat in meat.
b	Right.
sd	Fish is pretty good for you,
^2	Kind of see what happens.
o@	and, it's almost impossible
sd	your ketchup has sugar in it.
sd	that's that's a problem,
fc	Okay.
fc	Let me tell you it's,
fc	It's a little different, challenge, isn't it?
fc	Where are you going studying?
sd^t	I've been on this list for two months.
sd^t	I think I've made four calls .
sd^t	and lot of times we don't answer the phone, probably when I get mine early in the evening .
qy	Have you been to any lately?
sd	I haven't really seen one since probably August because, every weekend in the Fall we go to our high school football game on Friday then we go out with friends after,
sd	and that's kind of the our social for the,
sd	But, I saw, ROBIN HOOD, which I didn't care for.
sd	and my husband dragged me to it.
sd	but he just, to me, is not a very dynamic actor.
h	I don't know .
qy	Did you see,
sd	That's the last one I saw, I think.
o@	and. I do too.
sd	I really enjoyed that.
b	Right.
sv	Which most of them probably aren't .
sv	so they've probably seen about everything at this point .
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I know it.
sv@	We can see some pretty raunchy stuff on just regular T V without cable or anything. You know
sv	there's no way to protect them any more.
sv	it'll teach a great lesson, because she ended up in so
sd	But it was a fun movie to watch.
qy	the scary one?
sd	I didn't see that,
b	really.
sd	I like scary ones that are realistic.
sv	They say is really frightening, too.
sd	, the new one that came out.
sv	They say it's really horrifyingly scary
sd	He doesn't like to be scared .
sd	They liked it.
^2@	And it was still scary? no.
ba	Gosh.
sd	I know my husband wouldn't have stood for that.
sd	he likes MARY POPPINS and things .
b	Yeah
sd	I really like a variety.
sd	and we lived there for five years when we first got married
sd	it was familiar your accent.
b	Oh.
sd	I don't know up there.
aa	uh huh.
sd	Well, see the accents up there fascinated me, because even in his family alone, there were several different accents the way they would pronounce words differently.
sd	most of them were twenty or so you know.
sd	and so they were together for all that time .
sd	their accents differed a little in the family
sd	in the sixties.
sd	I finally.
sd	I knew it was easier back here.
sd	but I was real familiar with Texas.
sd	I went to college here and everything.
sv	and life is a little slower, a little easier.
sd	so it worked out.
qy^r	Was it hard when you first came?
ba	my.
ba	I know,
aa	yes.
qy	Were you all transferred?
qy	read any good books lately? .
b	Uh huh.
sd	and at Christmas break I read, SARUM by, a fellow named Rutherford.
sd	well it's sort of the historical fiction about, the Salisbury area in England.
sd	But he did this job well,
qr	do you find you have much chance to read for just pleasure or mostly for business?
b	Uh huh.
ng	I don't think I have seen it.
b	Oh.
sd	I think I have heard about that.
qy	did it have something to mention about, sort of, cultural rituals of manhood?
qy	Is it IRON JOHN?
ba	Good.
br	B L Y?
ba	Great.
qr	do you have a favorite subject to read, whether it be science fiction or history
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
b	Okay.
sd	That sounds great .
qw	who is your, favorite religious author?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Max Lucado?
b	Yeah.
sd	I've met him several times.
b@	 Uh huh.
o	Okay.
sd	and I liked it a lot because it had a lot of music in it.
sd^e	it's, It's, it's, Robert Townsend movie.
sd	but it was a lot of music a lot of old songs, things like that.
sd	and, it was called the DELLS,
sd	And, it was kind of like just about their, their life, and their, history and things like that and from, how they went from stardom to nonstardom.
qy	Have you seen that?
b^r	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	He's doing the Kennedy movie that's coming out,
qw	What have you seen?
sd	I know what you're talking about.
sd	It's called REVIEWING MY LIFE, or something like that.
sd	I didn't get to see that.
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
o@	It's, FATAL ATTRACTION .
sd	but one of my favorites, that I can watch over and over.
sd	I've just haven't gone out to see it.
qy	Was that pretty funny?
sd	but I need to see it.
sd	I guess it was so much suspense.
sd	And I like suspense.
sd^e	on that order.
sd	I forgot what her name is now.
sd	Anne Archer she was the wife in FATAL ATTRACTION,
sd	and she played in, narrow margin which was a little more recent,
sd	and that was kind of another suspense type, Alfred Hitchcock type thriller.
sd	God, I guess I haven't seen too many movies lately.
sd	I'd rather rent.
b	Yeah.
sd	and that's just for a bucket of popcorn, you know.
sd	God forbid you should want something to drink with it,
aa	easily.
sv	And you're usually going to go to dinner or something with that.
sv	it's almost more fun really to rent movies. You know, just kind of stay at home, maybe.
aa	that's true too.
sd	but then you can make your popcorn and you know, be comfortable.
sd	Well that's about all the movies I've seen recently .
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	I never did.
qy	Was that Arnold Schwarzenegger?
sd	KISS BEFORE DYING.
sd	it looks pretty suspenseful.
qy	Are you looking in the paper?
b	Oh.
sd	that was great.
sd	out of a piece of paper, they can kill somebody, you know.
sd@	and that's what was so scary about the movie, you know. Because he was such an awesome character, you know,
sd	but you were kind of on his side because he was so fascinating.
sd	but I won't tell you that, just in case you see the movie.
ba	very good.
sd	it should be a while yet, though.
sd	but I don't like Steven Seagal things,
sd	That's why, I, I just don't like the,
sd	I don't watch a lot of Arnold Schwarzenegger or anything like that either.
sd^r	that might be good.
b	Uh huh.
sd	or, you know,
sd	I like the movies that make you think.
qy	did you see it?
b	Uh huh.
sd	and she said it was okay, you know,
sd	it wasn't anything spectacular.
sd	but I never did,
sd	and everyone else watched it .
b^r	uh huh.
h	I don't know.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh,
sv	I think though, that movies are losing their luster.
sd	I can't pinpoint it.
sv	But it doesn't seem like it's as big, rage to get the movie theater as it used to be.
aa	exactly.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
o@	Let me ask you. Do you think the Soviet Union is a, still a threat to the United States?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv(^q)	and I think, that's making Gorbachev and others realize that, hey, maybe this Communist thing isn't working.
b	Right.
b	That's right.
sv	But I wouldn't doubt if the Soviet people think C I A and they think such bad things, you know.
sv	They do.
sv^m	they do, you know.
fa	excuse me, I've got a cold today.
sv	but, just on an economic point of view, if the Soviet Union doesn't do something fast they ain't going to be able to feed their people this, this winter, you know.
o@	But, on the other hand, I'm kind of getting fed up with, our own country and presidency, always concerning themselves with other nations' problems when we have so many at home yet.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sv	but, I think I heard in the news about last week sometime that, the president ended up canceling one of his international trips so he could spend more time on a domestic issue because the American public is kind of getting fed up with it.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yep.
aa	No.
aa	That's right.
sd	and where they're going than I do beca ,
sd	but I have kept, my eye on the Rangers.
sd	and then they kind of fell on their face .
sv@	They've got a one man show going there. Which is interesting, you know.
o@	 I guess he can really call down a salary .
sd	They're so astronomical I can't even imagine that kind of money.
sd	You know it's just, phenomenal .
ba	Well, good.
ba^r	I understand.
qy	you are involved with T I s, speech, recognition?
bk	okay.
ba	I see.
ba	great.
ba	I see.
sv	but the depth of knowledge is quite different.
sd	I don't understand football.
sd@	you know, it's such a rugged game that it seems to be too physical for my, interest . Uh huh.
sd	But I can't relate to football because I've never, played football and don't, have any interest,
sd	but now I have a grandson that you know, is gung ho for, football.
sd@	And, that doesn't please Grandma too much. because the injuries can be very, very devastating.
sv	I think the odds are cut down.
sv	but, I think that they have a lower racial of injuries, ratio of injuries in baseball.
b	Yeah.
^2	A love for them.
ba	I see.
b	Uh huh.
qy	did you sustain any permanent, injury with that?
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It was never set right.
sd	And so he brought me up from like a hundred and fifteen, I had my high game of two eighty seven.
sd	addressing that , to put the ball,
sd	So I got a lot of, recognition from the bowling league, I guess.
sd	I liked to as a method of, entertainment and I, fellowship
sd	but, I don't have, Jack standing behind me to tell me what to do .
sd^e	I'm not.
sd	I would have to brush up on my bowling before I even tried to, win a lot of money for the junior achievement, organization.
sd	But that's the only thing that I would, you know, be to do.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Still carries a good average?
sd	but, most of the time it is through the news in the evening
sd	But the majority of the time now I don't get a daily newspaper where, you know, I get tons of, news coming in that kind of stuff.
qy	you do ?
qy^d	You read it in the morning then?
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	sure .
^2	To see if they did it or if they, criticize you or put something in there wrong.
b^r	sure.
aa	exactly .
sd	But, unless there is a big issue going on like when we were at war then I think everybody was glued to the T V to find out what was going on.
sd	But, other than that, no.
b^r	yeah.
sv	and, other people that, you know, do it differently or don't even watch any news at all
b^r	sure.
b	Sure.
b	Yeah.
b^r	yeah.
qy^d	You're not, further up.
sv	I suppose you watch for hurricanes coming in and things like that.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
qw	Well, what kind of music did you all listen to? .
b	Uh huh.
fa	or, I am sorry,
sv	I am going to make you sound like you're eighty something.
bk	Okay,
qw	What was,
qw@	what was you doing during Woodstock? Uh huh.
sv	You would have had a ball.
sv	I kind of would have liked to have been there.
b	Yeah.
qy^g	Don't you wish you had been able to, though?
sv	that would have been such a great memory.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	You went and planted a tree or something?
sd	when I grew up, we did not have any causes.
qy	you know what I mean?
sd	Well, I do remember demonstrations over busing.
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah
sd	By the time I was born, even now, you know, women's rights,
sd	Daddies Are People Too.
sd	The judge will usually, give custody to the mother ninety seven percent of the time. Because they go through the female.
sv	But it does seem, you know,
sv	It really does.
sd(^q)@	He said, "My kids are my cattle." You know. But that is the way most people feel, that women should get custody.
sd	and I have got two kids.
sd	He is still back there in the seventies .
o@	but, you know, to him,
sd	He, you know, he does stay with it as far as music and stuff goes,
sd	If I like it I am going to wear it.
sd	But, my husband is not a conformist at all .
b	Uh huh.
sd	My husband works for the railroad.
sd	I want to tend to her.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And my mom had six kids.
sv	But I know that it would have been better had Mom been able to stay home with us.
sv	and they do need parental guidance twenty four hours a day.
qy	Do you stay home with yours?
b	Uh huh.
^2	They raise them.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, I think that's neat.
b	Right.
sd	But now, we are trying to go back to about the sixties, you know, when the mother was staying at home.
qy^g	what do they call it, the nuclear family?
b	Yeah.
na	Now one of my sisters is down here.
sd	and, my husband was in the service when I met him.
sd	so I am keep having to scratch his back.
^2	Outside of, I mean, going,
sd	I would rather work at home, if I could.
sv	Bringing their computers home and working from there.
sv	kids could see their parents, you know, how hard they work,
sd	and it was three and four days a week.
sd	my little boy he went wild. You know, mean because he had been used to me being there all the time,
aa	yeah.
sd	and it was costing too much at home, more at home than I was bringing in.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you know what I mean?
br	you what?
bf	We passed them on to us.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No.
b	yeah.
fp	Hi.
qw^d	I'm wondering what camping means to you.
sd	I don't think of, trailers and campers and all this stuff.
qy	do you do much camping?
ba	gee.
sd	but, up until, gee, maybe five or six years ago, I did a lot of it
sd	and so, I camped a lot in, the Middle East
sd	and I was able to camp right in ruins, which was always very exciting and, a bit exotic , for those who love bugs,
sd	but, , and then when I used to come back to the states in summer we'd often go up, to the lake country in New York with my brother's family and do camping there.
qy	And you're not going?
by	that's too bad,
sd	I grew up camping, being in Girl Scouts and things like that,
b^r	uh huh.
sv	a nice tent on the shore of a lake,
sd	and you get up when it gets light .
sd	and, I guess just the change, from the rat race.
sv	I mean, you know, it's really hard to get away
sd	and I guess when we did sites in the Middle East, of course it was with a group, in order to make it safe
sd	we just sort of put out the sleeping roll .
b	Right.
o@	 and I'm very eager to start,
sd	I love to walk
o@	and, you know, I think that that might be a little eerie at first, going alone.
sd	but, you know, I'm going to try .
sd	I hope you get into camping some day, just slowly.
b	yeah.
sd	and I said, Gee whiz, for twenty dollars we can go down the road and get a motel which we did,
qw	What kind of movies have you been seeing lately?
sd	it's an excellent movie.
b^m	SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?
qw	What was that anyway?
bk	Okay.
sd	and, and, I can't the last name.
sd	we really enjoyed, DEAD POETS' SOCIETY.
t1	and, who played the father, anyway
sd	excellent movie.
sd^e	we have.
sd	we loved it.
ba^r	I know what you mean.
sv	but, I mean, you know, basic thick western U S accent for a ROBIN HOOD just doesn't seem to fit.
sd	It's a good movie.
sv	Well, they did a real good job with it.
sd	he worked hard at it.
sd^e	I haven't, an opportunity to see that,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	It sounds kind of like one, we saw at home here rented it, CLARA'S HEART.
sd	Whoopi Goldberg.
sd	she's a housekeeper.
sd	she. She was now I can't say it, a Haitian.
sd	It was just a good movie.
b^m	A KISS BEFORE DYING.
b	Yeah.
sv	that takes a good bit to make one that's predictable that's still worth watching.
sd^t	It's been down this weekend.
qy	In the school systems?
qw	What school system does he go to?
bk	Okay.
sd	and I teach in Dallas.
sd@	And my husband teaches with Plano. In the what?
ny	yeah.
sd^e	they're still in elementary.
b	So, yeah.
b	Uh huh.
nn	No.
sv	I know when you get the kids that have gone the summer being out of school, then it's like they've lost so much ground, we spend at least the first six weeks just backing up, reteaching what they had the year before. You know.
sd	and Richardson's supposed to start some pilot schools, going to school year around.
sd	And then you know, we investigated this by flying some people out from Dallas to observe some of the schools in California that already had it.
sv	and we might as well use them.
^h	Well, air conditioning, and heating.
sd	that's forty degrees.
qy	Isn't it less?
sv	really, if you go year around there's not thirty days difference.
sd	Like I think going two six weeks and then having two, two weeks off, each after a two six weeks period is one way.
no	See, I don't know, because I've never seen it in action.
sd^e	the school system in Dallas has sent people there to do that.
nn	No.
sd	and I know a lot of teachers that would like to try it.
sd	and I heard that in Dallas, it's one out of every three is actually in the classroom of the educators that were hired .
sd	It's ridiculous.
^2	Marvin Edwards.
sd	and they've hired all these administrators in on that, you know.
qw	Pass or no fail, what is it?
sd	No play.
sd^r	No play.
^2	Carter High School.
b	Yeah.
sv	And all the things that Dallas fights, costs thousands, probably millions of dollars, I bet you.
sd	And psychologists and stuff.
aa^m	That's right.
nn^r	No ,
sv	now that's sad, when there's supposed to be what, you know, one thousand, sixty five dollars, something like that, spent on each pupil.
sv	But if we could do something like that I'm sure it would certainly help.
sd	and it's for kids that have fallen behind in their reading according to, like I T B S scores.
sd	and we always have to teach toward the middle of the road.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	My children's parents aren't even there at night most of the time to do anything with them.
b	Yeah.
sd	and we're going to do that until at least the first part of May.
sd	But see, they're not in Dallas.
sd^e	we're not working with the same type of students that most of these kids in Garland are.
sv	But see, what we're doing is we're turning these kids off to school even more than they are.
sd(^q)	Like our principal says, I want every child to be on task all the time.
sv	But we're expecting kids to.
b	Okay.
sd	If they finish before their thirty minutes is up, then they can go out and play for like maybe five or ten minutes, probably be the most.
^g	didn't you?
b	Yeah.
qy	I think, you guys in Indiana, don't you have the death penalty?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
sd	when I was an undergraduate, I was a member of Amnesty International
sv	the eye for an eye was a stupid argument.
sd	and I, you know, I've seen, I've seen cases in the news and all where, you know, a person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder.
sv	I think that maybe, a good solution to capital punishment might be, reserve it solely for, repeat offenders of a crime like, murder.
sv	but if a man's convicted of two murders, you know, there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong.
sv	to tell you how liberal I have turned, toward this, or, or whatever side that is I've kind of chosen, I believe it that, big time drug importers, like, say Noriega for example that these people need to be, eliminated, from society,
sv	and I think the death penalty is the best choice for those people, because, really any kind of, jail sentence for them is just another chance to, create another power structure .
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
qy	are there cases where you think that, the capital punishment shouldn't be, sentenced?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and they do have the death penalty.
sd	so, that was a curious case.
sv	something is sort of nightmarish to say the least.
sd	the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see, where elderly people are abused and things like that.
sv@	The first thing that I would look at would be their history. As far as any court cases that came out of there, the history of, you know, their doctors, their nurses, and things like that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Just out of curiosity, what kinds of things were they doing when they were considered a bad place?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my goodness.
^2	In pain or something.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's great.
b	Yeah.
sv	And my biggest fear that they would be, is that they would be lonely.
sv	And I would like to know that there are, you know, just a lot of activities, like you said, you know, just putting a plant in a room, You know. just brightens and, and just makes them, just a little more active.
sv	and, just to know that they're not, you know, laying in a room, looking at gray walls. You know, that's what would just really kill me.
sd	I'd like to know that, you know, they have friends there,
sd	and they have little conversations and things.
sd	I'd like to know there's a lot of interaction and, maybe some kind of activity, little field trips or something.
sd	I don't know how they would do that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	That's, really neat.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ba	That's great.
sd	That will be something, you know, they would look forward to if they knew, you know, that the puppy is coming on Wednesday.
ba	That's really neat.
sd	That really is.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	Putting any of my family in an elderly home, to me would be the very last resort.
sv	and I know it's hard for a lot of families if you're trying to work or trying to take care of your own family, it's kind of hard to because an elderly person sometimes can be totally dependent, you know, on you.
sd	and, but it would really have to be a last resort, because that would just,
sd	I would feel so guilty.
sd@	Unless I knew that they were somewhere, I mean, just really great. You know, that they were really enjoying.
sd	I don't know anyone personally that's in an elderly home.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bf	Nod your head and smile at them.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
sv	That's something, that, if I had to work in an elderly home, I don't think I could do it.
sd	Like I would really like to be a teacher,
sd	But I don't think I could do it. Because I'm very, very emotional.
sd	And I mean, the minute something happens,
sd	I cry on, I mean, Hallmark commercials.
sd	That's just the end of me.
sd	And so I mean something real life, I just,
sd	I'm an education reporter,
sd	and I always go and do an education things.
sd	I meet these kids who are, you know, dropping out of school left and right.
sd	they're going to graduate early,
sd	and I just want to hug them, and go, you are just fantastic.
sd	And, you know, I could just imagine, you know, working in a home like that,
sd	And those people, they're so sweet and, and so genuine, You know,
sd	and all they want is just for everything to be happy,
sd	and you know, And so that would probably just tear me apart. I mean, in a good way,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I'm sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean, usually a of elderly people they like to, share their experiences with the, with the younger children.
sd	They'll be telling them all kinds of stories. that they don't even know what they mean.
sv	so they need to share it.
sd	And I'm sure I'll be like that, too.
b	Yeah.
sd	I didn't know there were such groups.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	And I would hate it if anyone put me in one.
b	Yeah.
ad	Somebody take care of me.
fc	well, nice to talk to you.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	Well, I've been thinking I'd love to buy a new car, right now, if I could afford it.
sd	and I think that would be just the perfect family car .
b	Oh .
qw	What is it?
b	Oh.
sd(^q)	and it said Toyota, made in Japan, right across the front of all the engine parts .
sd	so they just put different names on them depending on who they're being shipped to.
b	Yeah.
sd	It was real interesting.
sv	But, you know, I would really want something that I would want for that much money. For ten or twelve or fifteen thousand dollars or whatever.
aa	definitely .
sd	I'd be wondering, you know, here I am buying this expensive of a car and my house isn't worth that much money .
aa	That's true.
b	Yeah.
sd	and we got more features and air conditioning and whatever on it then we did on our brand new one for twice as much money.
sv	or, you know, make sure that you can have it checked out well enough .
ar	I wouldn't .
b	Yeah.
sd	we bought one like that.
sd	but this one was my husband's
sd	and they're usually quite similar, I think.
sd^e	he's from here
sd	so we kind of met halfway
sd	and they, planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin and had, you know,
sd	we went to the reunion in end of June and first of July that part the fourth of July weekend,
sd	but we had to plan everything like clear in December, January to reserve that.
nn	No
sd	this was everybody.
sd	I, jeez, I think over, three hundred were there.
sd	It was quite a large
sd	so it wasn't too hard for them to come in the day and leave.
sd	and we do that with his family about every five years, a great big one.
sd	And then like immediate family like we try to do one thing once a year.
sv	Well, he has eight brothers and sisters
sd	so that's big by itself.
ny	Yeah.
sd	So we have a little shindig with them.
sd	there are four of them who live here in Texas, and his mom and dad.
sd	So, the others live in close neighboring, states, like Nevada, Arizona I think like that,
qo	How about you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's hard.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and my mom's family does it once a year, just like you said
sd	You can come and go as you please type thing.
sv	you just cannot do that.
sd	There are enough in the area to just kind of span yourself out.
sd	and my cousins, they just go stay with their mom and dad, you know kind of thing.
sd	And so it's not hard in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one Utah area
sd	but the real planning, that's the real key
sd	and that's how they divide it up
o@	and then, she has ten in that family
sd	and each one of them take their turn.
sd	And then the parent who's turn it is, her children help her,
sd	like if it was my mother's turn all of us children would help her put it on kind of thing.
sd	My children are all grown up.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I'll bet.
ba	I'll bet it is.
qw	What is the favorite thing you do with your children?
b	Uh huh.
qy	You just watch them play,
sd	but I didn't feel like I was very good at it either.
sd	My grandson got me to one day,
sd	Different worlds
sd	And I don't even know what they're talking about.
qy	Do you?
b	Yeah.
sd	I know when our kids were growing up, we were big into water sports.
sd	but I had all girls
sd	so we didn't do too much sports wise.
sd	I find my grandchildren are very involved in soccer and baseball
sd	and little boys do all of those things
b	Uh huh.
ba	I'll bet you really are.
b	Uh huh.
o@	but, you know, that was just for a couple of years when they were pretty small for girls
sd	and then they got more interested in other things,
sv	but I think that's probably what it was.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think, the older mine get, the more I enjoy them.
b	Uh huh.
sd	it wasn't that I didn't like them when they were little,
sd	but the older they got, I enjoyed them as teenagers.
sd	of course three girls, they've all become women in themselves that it's been neat to watch them.
sd	what kind of wives, you know.
sd	How they do things
na	Two of them live real close to me.
sd@	most of our time spent with them is, they come over to eat. And bring the kids
sd	and we play with the kids, you know.
sd	they camp out
sd	and we spend weekends in the country with them quite a bit,
sd	but as far as doing any activity, now that the grand kids are here, we all just stay around the house mostly.
sv	It's too much effort to go somewhere with all the kids.
sv	They'll always remember it, too.
sd	I need to take my boys to do this or that, you know.
sd@	And I remember the year we went to Disneyworld, as quick as my kids are big enough, we're going to go to Disneyworld . You know .
sv	they just really can't wait to be able to take their kids where they had fun.
qy	Do you work?
b	Uh huh.
sv	The time you have with them has to be quality time then.
sd	I imagine that they have, a lot of homework, too.
sv	and especially if they're active kids.
ad@	we need to discuss the voters. On a national and a local level.
sv	I blame it to apathy.
qh	Why should I go out of my way when it doesn't matter.
sv	And I think the other thing is the news media puts such a blitz on it that they had it predetermined with a half of one percent voting, you know.
sv@	and by time, say you get off work and go to vote. You feel like it doesn't make any difference. Due to the overabundance of news we have available to us.
qw	What do you think on the local elections though?
sv	I think that the people that have, a lower income, which you automatically equate with lower education tend not to be registered.
sv(^q)	or when it gets down to the point of someone saying are you going to vote today, they say, Well, I would
sd	and I believe in this,
sd(^q)	I had someone tell me that, I will never register to vote because I don't want to serve on a jury .
sd	I was just so surprised and amazed with the statement that they say only registered voters can be picked for jury selection.
sd	if they don't vote, they don't have to be on a jury.
sv	There is convoluted logic for you.
aa	Yes.
sd	That one was just beyond my imagination.
sv	you're probably right.
sd	and they had, like a ninety eight percent turnout.
sd	They were standing in lines to vote.
sv	And their vote didn't count .
^2	Or any one shows up.
sd	Back gone the full circle.
aa@	certainly, there's a message there. Even if they lose.
sv	and I think women turn out to vote for women, too.
sd	but by golly we're going to make a statement here you know.
b	okay.
^q	and she did it backwards in high heels.
^q	don't tell me what women can do.
sd	I'm pretty sure I did.
sv	Well, and some of the issues are so emotional.
qy	Have you followed the Dallas elections on zoning?
sd	I don't live in Dallas county.
sd	even the news. You cannot follow what the actual facts are at this point.
sd	I don't really know if some of the poor judges that are trying to decide how it should be divided.
sd	I wonder about them at some point.
qh	Should judges be elected or appointed.
qy	Are they politicians,
b	Sure.
sv	that's one of those you can pick either side
sv	and we could spend a lot of time on it because it's difficult.
sv	It's situational, really.
b	Oh.
sd	I was worrying along the lines of you get every time someone puts in a ballot in a ballot box a dollar bill comes out the bottom.
sv	That might work in some places.
qw	So what are your opinions on it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^g	Right?
qw	so when did it end?
sd	and I don't remember a lot about anything at that time in my life very much in, great detail.
sd	So I am pretty fa ,
o@	but I'm really not. You know what I'm saying?
^q	and let's go to war for that way
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I don't know, you know, I can't say that I agree with Vietnam, because how can you be gentle unto all men, and then shoot them.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and so something good did come out of that, in that now, you see what I mean, if like now,
b	Uh huh.
qy	Is that right?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and I've kind of avoided that, those, the war things, and how God approaches that because I think it's just now coming up to where I really feel like I come, you know, need to decide, what I feel.
sd	They left a woman, and a child, and the sheep.
o	Yeah.
ba	I know.
sv	Bush wouldn't, because it wouldn't make any sense, you know what are I'm saying?
sv	and I think that's a problem for a lot of politicians, is they want the glory.
qy	Do you see what I mean?
sd	Beverly.
aa	that's a big one.
sv	or that's what I think is a big one.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
sd	That's really in the last thirty years has changed significantly.
sv	I don't know what's causing society to have so many broken families and things like that, because I think that's bad for us.
b	Uh huh.
qy^c	are you there?
sd@	I take DOLL READER and DOLL WORLD . Because I collect dolls .
sd	I also take BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS.
sd	so he just sent away to get some woodworking books.
qw	So what kind do you, get?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	but other than that I never liked that really.
sd	I can hardly wait in the mornings for the newspaper to get here, you know.
o@	But, other than that, magazines, I don't know. There's so much advertising in them anymore.
b@	okay. Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	So now that I'm into dolls, that's about all I really want, you know.
sd^e	I think they're interesting.
ny	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well those travel magazines, more or less, show you different countries that you could go to
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well I don't know any other magazines I could talk to you about.
sd	I don't take anymore than that .
cc	Well I guess that will be it then
qw	what is your favorite, food for a dinner party?
qy	Do you do Tex Mex?
qw	how do you make fajitas?
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
o@	Oh. Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	it sounds good.
ba	Well, that's nice.
sd	well, basically, because I lived in the Middle East for a while I tend to fix Middle Eastern foods when I have, have people over.
sd	And so, some of the dips are like chick peas mashed with, sesame.
sd	I forgot, , what it's called,
na^r	that's right.
sd	now I remember it.
sd	And, dipping Arabic bread, the thin piece of bread in that.
sd	those of us that have gas stoves bake it on top just like putting it in the gas flame and sort of getting it black, on the outside but mushy on the inside.
qrr	or is it, turkey?
qr	Would you barbecue a turkey or a chicken
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I wouldn't imagine that a barbecued chicken would.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	right.
fc	Well, it's been fun talking to you.
fc	Right.
fc	in Wyoming it would be less spicy?
fc	dear.
fc	very good.
fc	bye bye.
sv	I imagine you can't escape it .
sv	Well, of course, it was fun for you .
qw	To?
b	really.
sd	I was born and raised near Miami and, spent the last twenty years in Dallas where the Rangers played.
sd	And, for the last, roughly year, I've been in San Francisco where there are two teams. The Oakland A s and the San Francisco Giants.
sd	but honestly, you know, I do my duty and watch the sports on, the newscasts
sd	but that's about all the exposure I have to sports.
sv	Well, I guess the, San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A s were like the leading teams a couple of years ago.
h	That's sort of what I gather.
qw	What is the prognosis for, this year?
qy^d	I assume that means good for the Minnesota ,
ny^c	Yep .
sd^c	I think a train went by.
sd^c	but I think it probably was the train.
sd	I, sort of gathered that in my, subliminal memory.
b	Huh.
qy	The A s?
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b^m	Eighty six?
ba	Huh!
sv	Well they must play every day then.
sd	I mean eighty six times two is a hundred sixty.
sd	And Lord, that's, over five months worth.
sd	Even if they play every day, that's over five months worth.
ar	No.
sd	That was the Super Bowl.
sv	I think you don't know all that much more than I do about baseball .
b	okay.
b	okay .
sv@	I think one of the most significant changes that have happened is that they've changed from homemaker to the work market. And for several reasons.
sv	and some is they're more educated than they used to be I think.
sv	I think sometimes, leaders in government they've become more, adroit in that area, too, instead of just men all the time.
sd	We have more women in government.
ad	And, now I'll let you say something .
^2	Very limited.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	I think that's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	I really think women have so much more responsibility you know, as far as everything.
sd	the average today of having a single family, you know, with the mother as the head, you know, it just really, so commonplace, nowadays.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And my mother had a nursing degree and was able to make it in her profession,
qy@	isn't that funny? that they were able to do it, you know,
sv	and even today I think the chance for education j , is, is so much, better for all of our girls, and boys, too.
sv	but the girls especially.
^2	A lot of things,
b	Right.
sv	We're not going to see a lax off of women in the work force.
sv(^q)	and I think that they're going to, be really responsible and do everything just like, what you said, you know, make the grade and make it so women can be the top people in their, in their field.
aa	I think so.
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	Exactly.
aa	Exactly.
sv	And I think that is happening more and more.
sv	I think it's just going to take a little bit longer.
b	okay.
fc^m	Good to talk to you, Sally.
fc	Thanks.
b	Yeah.
sd	and I did live in, San Polo Brazil for four years.
sv	and, maybe it would be better that we let the Panamanians run it however, I think, we're certainly justified in, our actions dealing with, Noriega in this ...
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	I haven't.
sv	but now we're in a situation where the United States looks like we're it now.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	Well he doesn't care as long as he's feeding his family.
sv	I mean they make the things that Custer did look like, like trivial.
sd	and, you know we set up ...
sv	I mean, Teddy Roosevelt didn't have the reputation, speak softly and carry a big stick for nothing
b	Right.
sv	I can't see communism in that country carrying on past him.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sv	there may be a point at which, you might want to consider some kind of socialistic, organization or socialistic set up to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a democracy.
b^r	right.
sv	But cocoa leaves sell real well right now, it seems,
sv	that's where your absolutely right is we've got to do something in that region to encourage, or to make him growing bananas profitable again, I mean.
b	Right.
sd	I never know when the D I A may be, listening on my phone .
b	Right,
sv	it's got to be horribly tempting for those peasants.
sv	and there's dishonor in not being able to do it
b	Uh huh.
qy	are you reading the papers about the Middle East summit?
sd	I think I was worn out from Middle East after the war.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I don't know in the short run it would be really nice to get the hostages all back.
o@	I, I, I guess we grew up in such a different world I could never even imagine taking hostages.
qo	But I don't know what do you think some of the long term repercussions might be?
b	Yeah.
sv	I wish those countries could have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do.
sv	so I think that's something that has to be considered too.
sd	and I was just thinking, well, peace is peace you know,
sd	and that really is the nicest thing.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I think so.
sv	probably all of the other Arab countries said that we were sort of wimpy for not forcing him out.
b	yep.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think the thing is though I guess the Arab countries that used to argue with us or not support any ideas that coincide with the U S ideas or whatever used to probably receive money from the Soviet Union.
sv	I think that's really, probably what started the whole process.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think that they're so much more vulnerable now because they don't receive support from the Soviet Union
^q	but we really won't change in the long run.
sv	I think that's the way I sort of see them all working, you know.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I always find it very hard in my heart to align with the Israelis because they seem to be just as bad as the Arabs, you know.
sd	They have to be subjected to all of the Arab bombings, and terrorist attacks and whatever.
sd	My grandmother's almost ninety seven.
sd	I mean, I hope I don't get like that when I get old.
bf	you don't know if their complaints are legitimate.
sd	but he's quite well off.
sd	So they can't hide anything on you or anything like that.
sv	But I have heard of really awful conditions, especially down the southern part of the the country which is.
ba	that's terrible.
qrr	Is she of Alzheimer's or something like that?
b	Oh.
bd	that does happen.
b	Yeah.
sv	And that happens a lot when people are sick or they just real manic depressants, they end up being put in homes,
sv	Even though it's very expensive to stay at home mentally it's just the best thing for you.
sv	and it's so ironic is that they go in there and they lose weight.
sd	and now they're feeding them, quiche and all kinds of strange food that we would eat.
sd	that's the thing my grandmother really misses, I mean, really growls about.
b	Oh.
qr	Do you sing or knit or anything?
sd	but that's all I've done.
qr	Do you make sweaters and things or just blankets?
ba	I see.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's just too time consuming.
sd	I've been trying to get some wedding gigs and things like that.
sd	But, if I could do anything I wanted to do, it would be to sing professionally.
b	uh huh.
sd	I work for channel six in Waco.
sd	It's not as exciting as it , as it sounds.
sd	my day is usually pretty full.
sd@	And even if I had a hobby like knitting or something and I wanted to take it to work, I'd probably never get to it. You know,
sd	Normally.
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd(^q)	and he was like, you didn't make that.
o@	but, Yeah.
qw	How many children do you have?
sd	I hear them in the background there .
sv	that's a hobby in itself.
sv	A job in itself.
sd	I was getting ready to fall asleep.
sd	but I really haven't done anything really, professional per se.
sd(^q)	and, I just now got some business cards that say, singer,
sd	I mean when someone comes in, you know, for a wedding dress, they might ask about it.
sd	This one woman even wanted me to bring my tape in because I have a demo tape, you know, if any one wants to listen.
sd(^q)	so that would be great, if someone came and heard it, and they were like, I want that voice,
sd	but, . I haven't got any calls, yet
o@	so, hopefully I'll get some calls in. Especially now since it's spring
sv	and it's the wedding season, I guess.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Then I could be getting paid for something I love to do.
sd	but, I'd love it.
sd	I try, you know, in school
sd	Sing pop music.
sd	So, that's what got me really, really interested in it.
sd	So I'm trying to be sensible, too, at the same time.
ad	hold on one second.
fp	Hello.
qy^t	are we suppose to hear a beep or anything?
h	so, I don't know.
fc	and, and good luck with your hobbies .
qy	Laurie?
sd^t	and I'm supposed to compare those with my habits.
ny	Yes.
b	Right.
sd^e	I do not.
b	Uh huh.
b	okay.
sd	I'm a traveling person
sd	so I use credit cards quite a lot also as far as everything from service work and gasoline in my car to my lounging, entertainment and for everything.
sd	she uses a credit card, most of the time.
sd	so she'll use them more than I will.
ny	Yes.
sd	They'll have to look up the number because I'm never carrying a credit card.
sd	But I do carry like my American Express and my Visa which I use for, you know, primarily work type things.
sd	This is my first call by the way,
bh	is it really?
sv	so we're both beginners then.
sd	so this is my first time to, to use it.
sd^e^t	I was given this topic.
sd^t	you call the eight hundred number,
qy^t	Have you tried it yet?
sd^t	When you call the eight hundred number, they assign you a topic and, pretty, cut and dried .
sv^t	about two three minutes I think.
sd	one thing I've always tried to do is when I get my credit cards, I always try to pay them off because I just sort of detest paying interest.
sd	like years ago my wife and I got married
sd	and I was giving everyone ten dollars a month and everything like that.
o@	 Or at least I try to,
sd	so they should follow the same rule.
sd	it's an absolute savings.
sd	Well, I think that's all I have.
fc	I think you'll enjoy it.
fc	Okay.
fc^m	Thank you.
sv	I think you got it.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, it sounds like you have really strong views on it.
sv	And just to play devil's advocate, it never seems right to me, that, we take in people that are criminals and people that are, you know, low income or even middle income that are struggling to provide for their families,
sv	that I find very difficult to swallow, sometimes.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I'm with you there.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And then when you think of the thousands and thousands of dollars that get burned in court costs, you know, we could be poor people and helping, you know, helping the environment.
sv	I mean, prison is such a waste of a human being.
sv	It doesn't do anyone any good.
sv^e	people need to be punished,
sv	and I do agree with your statement that to take a human life is wrong.
sv	but locking someone up and not getting, you know, any benefit from that for the person or for society to me is wrong too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And we want to remove them.
sv	but I think that the whole crux of the problem is, no one has come up with a solution that is acceptable, that does, you know, basically, you know,
sv@	and number two, it's it's the punishment, it's the ultimate punishment. Because, you know, they've harmed someone
sv	and, you know, you want to appease the people that have suffered.
sv	But it really doesn't take their pain away.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
sd	and she interviews, inmates all the time that are coming up for parole.
sd(^q)	And she says it is just really frightening how easy it is to, you know, have the prisons release people because they're overcrowded.
sv(^q)	She says, just their emotional state and their way of thinking is so incredibly wrong
sv	and there's not anything she can do to keep them in. You know, if they meet certain guidelines, you know,
sv	and those guidelines keep getting lessened and lessened because they have to do it to make the system work.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I would like to see the money that's been budgeted for new prisons being put into the research of alternate solutions to the problem.
qh	How are we going to make that happen?
qh	What power do we have?
b	Uh huh.
b	That's right.
ba	I know.
sv	But it sounds like you are, you know, interested in what's going on around you.
sv	and I guess that's, you know, what we're meant to do.
sv	Maybe an opportunity will come by that we will have a chance to make a real change.
qw	Where do you work?
ba	That's great!
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
sv	Most of us are so sheltered, you know.
sv	And a few people in the news that bring it to us and make us see what's out there.
sv	you're really performing a benefit to society in doing that.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I'm just, I'm just agreeing with you. When I think of it, how difficult it must be to just to just give the facts. Because usually on an issue that you really care about, you want to, you know, persuade people to your viewpoint.
sv	that has got to be a challenge sometimes.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
bf	And you have to walk right down the middle with it.
b	Yeah.
cc	And I'll read your book sometime.
fc	I enjoyed it.
fc	Thanks for calling.
o@	 Well, that's funny because I just, quit my job to stay home with my kids.
sd	so I know a little bit about it not, a whole great deal.
sd^t	It's such a broad, you know, topic that you need to boil it down.
sv	But, one that, , I thought it was a serious problem, that I'm not sure it's being taken care of right now, was like bilingual education for, different, minority groups and like Asians and, Mexican Americans and just people in general that speak other languages that sometimes come from other countries or coming from different areas they , and in this area,
sv	and, as the school district, I'm not sure how to go about it, because it's hard to get one teacher that speaks all these languages
sd	and so the teachers are not sure how to teach them math when they don't read or speak English.
o@	and, to me that seemed like a big problem in the school districts.
sv	A lot of the teachers were just not getting the backbone or support that they needed or the materials or the extra help that they needed for these specific children .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd@	and it teaches language too. Which is really good.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and it is just excellent.
sv	but it's unfortunate that they don't qualify, because I think everybody would benefit from these programs.
sd	It is excellent
o@	and, that's why I quit my job.
sd	and, you know, being a teacher, you see all these parents who are working and working and working and just, you know, don't have the time, time, time.
sd	I don't know how long .
qy	Well, are you in the market for a new car?
qw	What sort of requirements to you have for your car?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	top of the line.
b	Oh.
b^r	right.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	Well, I guess I'm, more traditional in that I don't like power windows or power locks, because the people that I know who have them always seem to have trouble with them.
sd	so I just don't like anything that I can't figure out why it doesn't work .
sd	and I want an air bag
qy	Have you?
sd	Somehow I just think, you know, I like the idea .
b	Right.
sv	that's a good idea.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	There was one car in all of the metropolitan area that I could find that, you know, was sort of a medium priced car with a stick shift in it.
sd	it turned out to be a Chrysler. , Lancer.
ny	Yeah.
sd	and they were really eager to sell it.
sv	So, I guess in this area, at least, you know, if it's not automatic, it doesn't move.
sv	and I thought it would be more reliable.
sd	I mean, you know, the people would just sort of look at me like, you must be crazy when I, went in to, and asked and that was a requirement
sd	Well, I'm not even sure all of them are anymore. At least in this area.
sd	but, now the people I've talked to don't seem to have stick shift.
qw	And so why do you like stick shift?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	and actually it's probably safer on, you know, long trips because it keeps you more active.
qy^d	There a lot of places to camp in Dallas?
qy	Do you do a lot of camping?
qy^d	Well, that must have been fun though.
ba	Well, that sounds fun.
sd	I've only been camping twice.
sd	I don't like those camping grounds where, you know, you got R V beside you and then another people in tents beside you.
sd	I just don't care for that.
sd	and the first time I left him we went overnight camping.
sd	And we had a ball.
sd	we just had, sleeping bags and fire going.
sd	And we fried potatoes and bacon and everything for breakfast the next morning.
sd	But my sister in law, she's always done a lot of camping.
b	And, yeah.
sd	The only thing we'd had to do, we had to go out looking for some kind of a grill, you know.
sd	and we, and we seen this old refrigerator that somebody had dumped
sd	and we broke the, I guess it's the freezing component
sd	and we broke that out of there and put it over our, hole.
b	Yeah.
sd	We had a good time.
sd	we're still waiting to go again.
b^m	Arkansas.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Pretty.
sd	so I like to get out by a lake or a, you know, somewhere close where we can swim.
b	Uh huh.
qw	How old are your boys?
qy^d	so they don't go camping with you.
b	Oh.
sd	well, I haven't taken my little boy yet.
sd	He is so fearless, it terrifies me.
qy	Think so?
sd	He'll go out into it until it's up to his nose and then try to tread back .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bc	If you know what to look for.
ba	Well, that sounds so neat.
b	Yeah.
sd	and that's who I stayed with.
sd	So we didn't do much outdoors stuff, except swimming
sd	and we went swimming a lot.
ba	I know.
sd	appreciate it.
fc	Thank you.
sd^t	and, there very few people that are on the list for calls, on the weekends nights.
qy	are you part of the school system out there?
sv^t	I guess they pass the names amongst your computer students, or whatever.
ba^r	great.
ba	That's wonderful.
sd^t	He had a roommate that had calls and everything.
sv	of course, we at T I just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will, sell like gang busters, really.
qw	what do you think, about Latin America?
b^m	Latin America,
sv	that is sad. not that we can, sell any great program we have with crime,
sd	I don't really know why though.
b	Right.
sv	We think of ourselves as the only Americans, when they're Americans, too.
b	yes
sd	I know.
sv	and they want us to say we're the North Americans.
sv	and they're South Americans,
sv	it's not my point, I guess,
sv	there, there may be some organized way to do this.
sd	getting thrown back I guess is all that, happens.
sv	we see it, you know, once a month. I'm sure in San Antonio they see it more often than that.
sd	well you saw it out there then, too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there, for the products certainly that we make and everything.
sv	And we need to do more of that, somehow. And encourage more business, between us.
sv	but, there's got to be a lot of potential down there.
qw^r	What are you taking in school?
^2	you're an instructor,
sd	you said.
qw(^q)	you said, what were you saying you were teaching there?
sv	they've got to be analyzing with a voice recorder some how.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	your voice echoes in your own head which makes it different than what it really sounds to other people.
sd	and you always hear your own voice in recordings and say, my God, that's obviously that's not me, you know.
sd	I've told my wife, that one of the reasons they're doing it is because eventually you'll be able to talk to your computer,
qy	Are you a T I er,
qy^d^t	but I guess customers too,
ad^t	you've got the question you can go first there, since I called.
sd	so that's a half an hour roughly the same with newspaper.
sd	so a real radio buff, especially when I'm doing chores.
sv	You probably haven't either unless you're a radio buff.
sd	But, I'm, I am kind of a radio buff.
^2	For music?
b	Yeah.
ba	That's good.
ba	that's good.
sd(^q)	she says, look at that person he's driving and reading at the same time .
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
ad	Go ahead ,
aa	That's a good point.
sd	It comes and goes.
b	Yeah.
b^m	Local you mean?
sd	We have that addition to our paper.
bf	, you get it from people then.
aa	Right.
sd	But, I always get a lot of my information from the, newspaper through her.
qy^d	you mentioned C N N, of course I mentioned radio and the C N N T V news, you know?
sv	It's the same thing that's on the radio, word for word.
o@	it, Well, it is C N N exactly. because,
sd	we have it here at work as a matter if fact, at T I.
sv	you don't really miss anything.
ad	your turn.
sd	I've heard that,
b	Right .
b	Right.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
qw	What do you think has occurred there?
sd	responsibilities is what I am trying to say.
b	Uh huh.
aap	By the same token, in most cases, women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who have been there before, but at lower salaries.
qy	Is that right and wrong?
aa	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Any individual thing
qrr	or is it just a general switch over?
b	Uh huh.
sv@	I have a feeling that business with the woman working out at the same level of responsibility as their husband sort of tears into their social or their loving relationship. In that, the lady needs to stand up for what she has made and her own rights and has a right to do so
qy	So do you think that is going to be difficult saying as far as marriages and people enjoying each other in the future years?
b	Uh huh.
qy	Well, do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur in the next generation, specifically?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
sv	a lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can get brought in at lower salaries because that's what everybody else assumes they are going to get.
qw	Well, how do you feel about women in, armed services?
b	Yeah.
qh	I mean how are they going to protect themselves so to speak.
sv	I really don't go for that.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and you're going to learn there is a lot of responsibility just keeping the home going .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	And if they go into the work force, they should be treated as nicely as well as a man or any other person.
sd	and you don't want them up that early.
sd	Very comfortable,
sd	There's the Apostle Islands, which are in Bayfield which is a wonderful place.
sd	And then there's also, what we found, in the state of, South Dakota, the Black Hills.
qh	if you're going to go camping, who wants to deal with bugs
o@	so. Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Sure.
b	Sure.
b^r	yeah.
^2	Anymore.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
sd(^q)	But as adults, it's like if I don't take a shower every day, I feel like, you know, ooh.
sd	If you can find, some really nice, clean, campgrounds versus, if you go to state parks,
sd	If you're going to be gone all day long, walking someplace or doing tourism or whatever you're camping really is just for like in the evening to start the fire, to sit back and watch a fire, to enjoy that, you know, and then to get up in the morning and get a shower and get cleaned up, that kind of stuff.
sd	and then every year I grow a garden.
ny	Yes.
sd	and then in the back I'd say we have about an eighth of an acre
sd	but then I've got, a twenty five by twenty area that I do gardening, as far as, you know, tomatoes and cucumbers and beans
sd^e	we have a separate area for the garden.
sd	and we tried a watermelon.
na	But just on the limited basis that I do it, I do enjoy it very much.
ba	wow.
ba	How about that.
ba	Well, that's nice.
bf	That much land requires an awful lot of time.
ba	How about that.
qw	What's a good apple to bake pies with?
sd	I saw, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY and FLATLINERS.
sd	Those were the last two that I've seen.
sd^r	FLATLINERS.
b	Oh.
sd	So that's why I saw that one.
sd^e	I haven't gotten to see you know, any real recent ones.
sd	I like comedies better than I do dramas.
qy	Did you care for SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY?
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, I didn't care for the movie myself.
sd^r	I didn't really care for the movie either.
qy	on likewise then, did you see PRETTY WOMAN?
qy	Do you enjoy that one?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I haven't even heard of that one.
sd	Like you said, you had to accept the beginning of it and just kind of go.
sv	it made you think a lot I think.
qy	Did you see GHOST?
qy	now, did you care for that one?
sd	but it wasn't something that I would enjoy seeing twice or three times.
sd	Meanwhile, I sat through the movie and said well, when are you supposed to start crying, you know .
sd	I didn't really, I didn't really find it to be a tearjerker .
sd@	I never pay to see one more than once. You know.
sd	In fact, that's where I've seen most of my movies, have been on video.
sv	You see it on video just as soon as it is on the movie screen.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
sd@	It wasn't a comedy. No.
sd	I didn't get to.
bh	really?
qw	Well, what movies are showing down there now?
qw	what was that one about Bob?
sv	I think it's just playing now up here.
sv	in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that I know and lawyers and whatnot, I think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem.
sv	Well, if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of Texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students so they could become doctors, the problem would go away.
na	I think the problem is that the doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors, and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor, you are going to pay high premiums unemp , I mean, on your liability.
qy	And you think there are plenty of doctors?
ba	It's astronomical.
sv	people don't sue
sv	If you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor they wouldn't sue a one of them. You know.
qy	You know what tort theory is?
sd	Well, a tort is when you do something wrong.
sv	an O B G Y N doctor cannot control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent.
sv	if they have complications and,
sd@	And the people that are really doing their job are paying for everybody else. You know,
sv	Just to prevent a a law suit.
b	Yeah.
sd	See, I believe that there is a system already in place for health care.
sd	You show up at Parkland bleeding
sd@	and they'll fix you. You know.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation the problem would pretty much evaporate.
sd	He's a divorce attorney.
sd	But I also know an, O B G Y N who has stopped practicing.
sd	he just said,
sd	I mean, he's not going to deliver any more babies ever.
sd	His malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year.
sd(^q)	And, you know, he said, he had to gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice.
b	Yeah
sd@	This, This guy is Catholic. Yeah,
o@	I mean, you know, Yeah,
sv	but, you're not likely to find somebody who is going to, you know, have a less conscientious effort.
sv	Insurance companies.
sd	And I think one thing about pets is they're a lot of company.
sv	and they won't tell anybody.
sv	They just give it, and don't expect too much.
qy	Anyway, do you have a pet?
b	Oh! .
sv	But that's good that you're going to get another one.
sd	But they just, really take care of them, or, are protective of them.
sd	and my kids,
sd	they'd take anything I think ,
qy^d	I guess your cat was an indoor cat.
^2	It kind of traveled around
sd	and, I think I liked that better.
aa	that's true.
sd	I'm like I know it will be fun the first week maybe,
sd	and then mom gets to take care of it, or something.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think it's really important to that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that, you know, we're not just going on with this pet population and having to, just get rid of them.
h	but I don't know.
b^r	right.
aa	I think that's really true.
b	Yeah.
sv	and that's good too.
sv	Well, I think that's all I have to say.
fc	bye bye.
o	Okay.
sd	It's real dry up here.
sd^e	We need rain really bad.
sd	but they're going to need some you know, rain to get the second cut.
sd	and if we don't have rain, she's going to lose a lot of money.
b	Oh .
qy^g	It's usually dry down there, isn't it?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I hope they come, this way.
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
sd	Now see, everyone up here with their gardens they're not going to have much of a garden this year because it's so dry.
b	Yeah.
bh	Really?
qy	is California getting rain then?
^2	Out of the Gulf?
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my gosh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	we could use two days straight of rain.
sd	It's really drying up here.
sd	and it's surely going to rain.
sv	Whenever you hang your clothes out on the line it always rains .
sd	We've had real hot weather.
sd	In March I was wearing shorts.
sd	I hope that,
sd	I hope that doesn't mean we're going to get an early winter.
b	Yeah.
sd	You know it was nippy
sd	but, like it was still in the seventies.
sd	You know, high sixties low seventies in March.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
ba	my gosh.
bh	Really?
sd	and I just like it where it's deep enough, you know, but not too deep.
bh	Really?
qy	Well, isn't it weird at Christmas time without snow?
b	Oh.
qy^g	You don't have the humidity either, do you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
^2	muggy, huh?
b	Uh huh.
sv	See that's what's bad up here is when we do get the real, you know, hundred and the high nineties, we have the humidity to go with it,
sd	your legs stick together just from walking you know.
b	Yeah.
ba	that's good.
sd	Well, I guess that's really about all.
qrr	or, how do you work your budgeting?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and then we just spend about so much.
sd	but I know that I go to the grocery store that we always stick within, you know, five dollars between here and there.
sd	A certain amount.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
ba	that's great.
sv	you guys sound pretty self sufficient .
b	Huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	but somehow we get back there.
sd	And, this year we did it by train because it was the least expensive
sd	And, you know, we could go to both places without having to spend so much for plane fare.
sd@	And so, we find that if we're careful with our, you know, just everyday things like grocery shopping and gas and entertainment, things like that, then, somewhere out in the wash, it will come out that we have enough to get back there. You know.
bd	that's all right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	that's right.
sd	but whenever I find, you know, a dime or something on the ground, I, I'll probably pick it up .
sd	You know, just count it up at the end of the year, something.
b	But, yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you have any strong opinions?
qy	You do?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	and it is going to be about six times more expensive.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and you don't have the kind of choices that we have here,
sv	and I really don't want to give up having those choices.
sv	I mean, there is a night and day difference between good doctors and bad doctors, and good hospitals and bad hospitals.
sd	And in England, at least at the time when I was familiar with it, about ten years ago, they just told you what day you had to show up and where you had to show up and who your doctor was going to be.
sd^e	I mean that.
b	Yeah.
^g	isn't it?
b^r	right.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you think?
b	Right.
^2	Really want to.
b	Right.
sv	and it's more of, seniority, I would imagine kind of thing, instead of having a skill or whatever to advance,
h	I don't know.
sv	We really do.
sv	And I, I think the problem with the skyrocketing cost right now is the insurance companies because, I don't see doctors getting real rich,
sv	and I think hospitals do make money, but not nearly as much as insurance companies.
sv	I think they are really making a killing and nobody is talking about it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b^r	right.
b	Right.
aa	Sure.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think that's the legal part of it coming into it to.
sv	I wonder if we should have a limit on how much people can sue for.
sd@	then if people weren't having to spend these huge amounts of money on getting insurance coverage. You know.
b	Yeah.
^g	Are you?
qw	At where?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm in Texas
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Okay.
ba	no.
sv	that, that can't be legal.
ba	my gosh.
qw	how can they make you pay for insurance coverage?
qw	how does it keep the cost down?
qy	so they just use the money for something else besides your insurance policy?
qy^d	So you're subsidizing the hospital.
b	Uh huh.
ba	good.
sd	but now I just in the last couple of years. I have gotten to the point where I am saying I just cannot afford to pay anymore, to help people out.
sv	but I need for the government or the agencies, to find a way to do it on the amount of money, you know, that I can afford.
sd	I just can't afford anymore.
sd@	Well, I guess, it has to do with a lot of the stuff that I find out I am paying for now. You know?
sd	Because our medical coverage has gotten increasingly worse over, let's see, the past five years, to the point now where even if we need surgery, our insurance only covers eighty percent of it.
sd	and so no matter what happens to me, if I get in a car accident this afternoon, I have you know, no way of being able to afford the outrageous medical costs, because my insurance is now only eighty percent of whatever it's going to be.
sd	I'm subsidizing,
sd(^q)	And what if they are lucky enough to get into a doctor and a program that's going to say, Okay, well, you really need to have those varicose veins fixed, or your teeth fixed or something like that.
qw	How come their kids are getting that?
sv	and they need that.
b	Uh huh.
h	It was something like that .
sd	or maybe this is just my own personal.
b	Yeah.
sd^e	no income tax.
b	Oh.
ba	Wow.
sd	but I tell you, we have incredible property taxes down here.
qy	First off, do you have children that are in it?
sd	I now have grandchildren, in the school system
sd	so, I don't have firsthand experience right now, with it.
qo	So what do you think?
b	Right.
aa	That's right .
b	Right.
sd	and I know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children were doing in the fifth and sixth grade.
sd@	You know, it's amazing, to me and stuff that I didn't do until I was in junior high. which, of course, shows my age.
qy	Is that scary?
b	Right.
b	Yes.
sd	I have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms.
qy	do you find that?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Right .
sd	Well, I know that this friend, is in the Plano School District,
sd	and she teaches, emotionally disturbed children.
sd	And she says she has, six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade.
h	I didn't quite understand it.
qy^d	I don't know how long you've been here .
sd	And and they were really hearty and stayed on
sd	and we've done really well with them.
ny	Yeah.
sd	it's hard to go out when it's this hot.
sd	And they're okay.
o@	, Uh huh.
o@	 Yeah.
sd	they keep the rain on the outside, little rain drops
h	I don't know.
ny	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
sd	we have that too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	dear.
nn	No.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Had somehow gotten in.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
h	and so I don't know.
sd	So like I wanted to go out and kill them too.
sd	it looks like our trees don't have any grass under them.
sd	And we just can't grow, grass underneath there.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^g	It's a vicious cycle, isn't it?
sd	It just really,
sd	but we've been thinking, you know, if we built up, you know, either a wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it like with a nice dirt then maybe we could plant some either flowers, or some new bushes in there that would live.
sd	And so I think that we're going to try that.
sd@	and I'm trying to decide whether to put like bushes in front of them or not. You know, maybe just halfway up the window or something like that. So people can't see and hear too much .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	So that's not too bad.
sd	They're pretty.
b	Yeah.
sv	But it's funny because, you try so hard I think sometimes to, anyway I do, to do our yard
sd	and then it's like the wind blows everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours to them
sv	or and so even if you did get it under control, it seems like in just a few months it would all be back
^2	It's hard to get out a lot and do that yard work.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm glad I have an old enough son to do it for me now.
o@	so, Yeah.
aa	Exactly.
aa	Exactly.
sd^t	I almost forgot what the topic was.
sd^t	but I know what it is.
sv	I think it's a great idea
sd	I've come from the teaching field.
sv@	I, I'd be for it. You know.
sv	But I, I would, I would probably go for going ahead and doing it, you know. If it's got to be done for everyone.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and you know, but I guess if they,
sd	I guess there's some companies that are doing it.
sv	And it seems to be working out
b	Right.
by	See, that's hard.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
o@	this is just something I've heard that it kind of goes into like, just your off the counter medication that you could be taking for a cold. That it kind of affects that too.
sd	I didn't know that.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qh	And what's kind of next.
br^m	The what?
b	Huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Right.
na	I kind of think they will.
b	Yeah.
sv	and I just I just kind of think it's going to eventually head that way.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	well, some of the books I've read lately have to do with crafty type things where I've, learned things that I'm going to do for my children for Christmas
qo	What about you?
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
sd	My husband and I had, took a book out of the library about gardening, too, and started a garden, a fall garden.
sd	but, some of them we learned from a book
sd	Now, I've read two books , that were, nonfiction lately
sv	and that was not enjoyment .
sd	but, I didn't enjoy it necessarily
sd	It was, about a Chinese lady and her generations down, what happened to her family through the years
sd	So I like those a lot.
sd	A WRINKLE IN TIME is one
qy^d	I don't know if you've ever read that
sd	and I would like to read those
sd	but, it's funny, because I've read some from like nineteen twenty three and nineteen forty five and things like that
sd	and I don't know if it's just because they didn't come from my era or what,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	my children and I started a thing where I read a book with them before they went to bed at night.
sd	and the people that she came to were just farm people
sd	and it was really a lot of fun.
qy^t	you ready to discuss the topic?
sd^t	the topic is social changes and discuss social changes in America and how they relate, or how they differ today than they were ten, fifteen or thirty years ago.
qy^t	You ready for that?
b	Okay .
br	Pardon me?
sv	there's been an awful lot of social change lately,
b	Uh huh.
aa	True.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	yes.
aa^r	true.
qr	Well, do you think that's good or bad?
b^m	You think that's great.
sv	and I think that's an excellent opportunity for us to expand ourselves also.
sv	But I believe that, an individual should really learn how to learn
sd^r	that's good.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress, for those people that are laid off and also for those people that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now.
qy	Okay, do you like to cook?
qw	what are you making?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	I mean are you single do you cook every night for yourself?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	well like if you were having a dinner party what, would you cook a variety of things, I mean, you know, vegetarian and nonvegetarian?
b	Uh huh.
sd	and that is what I'm having is pasta.
sd	Well for, for Christmas I got a, pasta machine,
sd	and all my friends are really anxious, you know, to have the homemade noodles
sd^e	it's the hand kind, old fashion kind .
b	Uh huh.
sd@	I like, you know, kind of still having in put that not everything's being done for me. You know.
sd	and, then just something for desert, you know, bread and wine and cheese stuff like that.
ny	Yeah.
sd	and I said heck it's kind of easy.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I live by myself,
sd	so it's not necessarily something that I would cook just for myself.
sd	and usually I'm pretty good about it.
sd	and my girlfriend and her husband loved it, in fact she passed it on to her parent
sv	and I was quite impressed with myself if I should say so.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, you know, I don't to the point of, you know, measuring down to the exact amount that they say.
bd	is that what it means.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	I haven't.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I just haven't gotten around to it yet.
ny	Yeah,
sd	but I'd like to know more about, you know, more elaborate things like guess.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I mean I'm always willing to try anything usually.
sd	I've taken a cake decorating class
sd^e	actually it was a private course, through like a com ,
sd	and then I guess just because I don't have the expertise to just hurry up and do it, like, you know, a professional would I go real slow
sd	and, you know, it's a little time consuming,
sv	but it's really worth your effort once you see how you do.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Uh huh.
aa	Sure.
bd	That's okay .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba@	my. Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, you learn helpful hints in the classes at least.
sd	You know, the instructor told us certain things about well, don't follow what's really necessarily on the box, you know, if you're making just a cake from a box, you know, do this cause, you know, make it a variety.
sd	You know, some different hints. Yeah.
sd	and, you know, all of the different, you know, decorating tips an things like that.
ny^r	yeah.
b	Well, yeah
fc	so that's about it.
fc	Okay, well.
fc^m	It was nice talking to you.
fc	Thank you.
o	Okay.
sd	We're official now,
b	okay,
b	yeah.
sd	and, the only recommendation I would have for someone who hasn't gardened is, one, get a couple of good books, of books, of course,
sd	and usually they have talk shows.
sd	Here in Dallas they have two great, talk shows that go through everything that will grow here, which is the opposite probably of what would grow up where you are
sv	and so. in fact, you could easily do that now, turn on a talk show up there and see if there's got to be some gardening folks on the radio that says when to put your grass in, and what kind of grass to grow up in Virginia and everything,
sv	for someone who doesn't garden, I'd say, that's my biggest recommendation is to,
sd^e	I like it a lot, 
qy	are you with T I up there
sd	and it is tough
sd	the part I don't like, I guess, would be from December through February where you have to rake leaves forever it seems like,
sv	so other than you know, those three months, when it's pure dog work the rest of it's very enjoyable just going through the experiences of putting little plants in or whatever
sd	but, but I do listen to that talk show.
sd	but there's some great, folks, that have been well trained, and, again, to, recommend gardening for this area.
sd	We grow bermuda and Saint Augustine here.
sv	see, you would have to learn that, though,
qy	or do you have to start all over every year?
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but we have to bring them in here in the Winter because usually, if it's not below the ground so you can insulate the roots from freezing you know, the pots will die,
sd	everything in a pot will die
sd	well, we do bring stuff in the garage and everything
ad	whatever subject you pick, do it the knowledgeable way
ad	don't go out there and start digging holes,
ad	Get some books of whether it be Pennsylvania or Virginia as well as,
sd	then there's always a gardening part of the newspaper or communications, as well as, I bet there's a talk show up there right now that if you turn the dial around you'll,
sd	you'll find someone, probably in the morning, I don't know discussing, you know, what we do up in Virginia to get something growing
sv	the soil's probably so good
sv	our soil's not very good down here.
sv	I guess in the ice age, it, it's pushed a lot of, limestone and everything, to some parts of Dallas you just can dig a foot down and you hit solid limestone, you know
sd	it's so scrubby 
sv	and I think that we even got our famous hundred year old pecan trees from Alabama and all that, too
sv	they're probably only in the South for pecan pie and all that,
sd	it's what they call pecan pie up there in the East.
sd	I'm from New Jersey originally.
sd	I've worked on that with a little chewing gum, which I shouldn't do,
qw^t	or how many times have you been called?
b	Uh huh.
nn	Well, no
sv^t	This is a great subject because they're out there gardening, you know,
sd	It is beautiful here today,
qy^d	You might have seen, if you've seen the news today about all the tornados here that were north of us.
sd	but it's here at work
sd	in fact, I'm at work today, believe it or not.
sd	But, they have T V s in the break areas
sv	You'll see that on the evening news.
sd	I guess it's related somewhat to the weather, you know and the plants and all that,
sd	it was north of us.
sd	they'll they claim thirty odd people were killed up in Kansas City, Kansas,
sd	but I'm sure you have plenty of trees.
sv	that is a key thing for shade and keeping your bills down,
qw	but where in Virginia are you all?
b	Uh huh.
qy	do you have the cherry blossoms in there or not?
b	Yeah.
sd	although again, we have to prepare the soil.
sd	that's one thing I noticed there.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Have you ever been down here?
sd	It is wide open, and flat
sd	and a lot of them have done well
sd	they do have some pine forest areas in wes , in east Texas where you have native pine trees,
sd	there's a tremendous amount of pecan trees that we use you know, for eating
sv	I think they thought that was going to be a great boom crop, hundred and fifty years ago, because they are all over the place in the South.
qo	What else? speech, synthesis,
sd	can't say it.
sd	they have had Speak and Spell and all that for years
sd	but they've come out with some different ones this past week,
sv	you're just going to have to talk to it you know,
sv	the classical thing for the handicapped, too, person who can't type very fast
sd	like I can of course
sd	not that I can type very fast either
b	Yeah.
qrr	or do you keep children for other people?
sd	that's exactly what I have.
ny	Yes.
sd	and my son was two in January.
ba	That's pretty close.
b	Yeah.
qy	Have you been able to do that all along
ba	how neat.
qw	How old were they when you adopted?
b	Oh.
sd	Well, I have always wanted to be able to stay home with my kids you know.
sd	I wasn't necessarily a career person
sd	but as long as I was single and had to work, I was going to get a good job and do the best I could.
sd	and by the time we had kids I couldn't quit.
sd	and course, we're hoping within, hopefully, the next two years I'll be able to quit and stay home.
sd	my best friend kept my kids from the time my daughter was born until she went to work last year in August
sd	You know, the friendship is more important.
sd	and I I knew, you know,
sd	I knew that they were taken care of
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	But she had no help?
qy^d	She was alone with them.
ba	that is hard.
b	Yeah.
aa	I don't either .
b	Yeah.
^2	You have to let them have some wild time if that's considered wild .
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	and we'd work it out.
sd	and that just did not work.
sd	and they get dirty
sd	I'm talking sand in the ears and the eyes and the hair
sd	the kitchen table, I'd find peanut butter and jelly all over the table and the chairs
sd	She told me about five thirty one afternoon, it was a Friday, that she wasn't keeping kids anymore as of Monday morning.
qh	so what am I supposed to do .
sd	and we went to some of the Kindercares.
b	Yeah.
sd	They had been going to it for years.
sd	But on Thursday I didn't like the Kindercares.
b^m	They didn't give him.
b	Oh.
sd	And doing something with him.
sd	Well, not only was it going to cost me like a hundred and fifty dollars more a month, which I didn't have you know. I, you know,
sd	and, you know, because they're, you know, like public, they're not private you know. They can't pray,
sd	and I don't want them indoctrinated you know,
sd(^q)	but I'd like them to be able to say, gee, God made the flowers, you know, and things like that.
b	Yeah.
^2	basic.
sd	and it's a private academy.
sd	and she has a three year old and a toddler, which mine was at the time.
sd(^q)	and she said if she leaves, she said, I'll let you have her spot.
^q	You can bring your kids Monday .
sd	I was just like, God set this, up for me.
sd	I have been at such peace with myself.
sd	and the cost was not near as much as the Kindercares were going to be.
sd	I hope you can understand what I s , .
sd	I was only about twenty dollars more a month than I was paying because being a private institution they're nonprofit.
sd	So, they don't have to charge as much.
sd	I told Russ that we should have done this a long time ago you know .
sd	I don't feel like I have to indoctrinate them by age three
sd	but it's kind of neat when they come home with it, you know.
o@	and, Yeah.
sd	and they work at the potty train ,
sd	I just feel like a big burden was lifted .
aa	It is.
ba@	I know. I know
sd^m	and that's hard.
b	Yeah
sd	I, I wish you could find a good Mother's Day Out because that would be good for your peace of mind also.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	so that was a pretty good pretty good time, you know.
sd	My baby sitter would take them and then pick them up.
b	So, that worked out real good.
fc	Well, I guess.
fc^t	It said child care criteria
fc	and I think we both listed an experience .
fc	And you too.
qw	Well, Nancy, what do you think, some of the changes in roles of women are in American society in the past generation or two?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I agree.
sv	women stay single longer it seems like.
b	Yeah.
sd	I know my mother and her sister were both married by the time they were twenty
sd	and I waited until I was thirty two,
ba	You know, I know that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Seems like there's.
ad	go ahead.
sv	there're a lot of, either divorced or, you know, never been married,
qw	Well what do you think have been the most significant changes in the past generation or so?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and it's affecting the families you know, for mothers not to be home, and yet, you know,
sd	I mean, I don't blame anybody when they have to work because,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	You think it'll continue?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I guess I see that happening already.
qr	Do you backpack or hike
sd	That sounds interesting.
ba	man, I imagine.
bf	and then you go for days at a time.
sv	God, that sounds like fun .
sd	I was, from California,
sd	and so we would go up to the Sacramento, river sloughs, the delta there,
sd@	if it got, you know over a hundred and ten degrees you went over the levee and jumped in the water. You know,
sd	but, when I got married, my husband had always backpacked.
sd	I like being able to go back into the mountains, or, you know, where the trail didn't necessarily lead, and where you couldn't necessarily, pitch a tent .
sd	and so your canoeing kind of made me think of that.
ad	Don't let that stop you .
ba	I know.
qy^d	so you haven't done that before.
sd(^q)	She said it was truly incredible.
sv	there's that sense of it, you know, you're kind of scared, that risk of like gosh, what could happen and then the thrill of, you know, the excitement of doing it,
qy	Well, do you have anything planned for this summer?
bk	okay.
ba	I imagine.
ba	that sounds good.
sd	my oldest child is a girl, was born three years ago, three and a half.
sd	I didn't want to go camping with diapers, you know.
sv	they'd be awake all night.
sd	but I think with him almost potty trained and, you know, she's not afraid of her shadow anymore, I'm hoping and crossing my fingers that we'll be able to go, this summer, you know, even if it's like over to Rio Dosa for a couple of days, or something to get them used to it and get them started, with little back packs of their own, and, you know, things like that.
aa	Well that's true.
sv	Ugh, I would need that before I could teach them .
na	I try to ride the stationary bicycle every day about five miles
qo	What about you?
ba	very good.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and he's done the whole canal, I think it's a hundred and eighty miles, with the scouts.
sd	you know, it's at home, I can do some of my reading,
sd^e	I live in Maryland.
sd@	so I'm able to, take advantage of the environment here. the neighborhood, also.
qr	basically, is your motive simply, health or because you enjoy it?
sd	I think pretty much you summed up my, my motivations also.
ba^r	that's great.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening.
sd^e	I'm not.
nn	No.
b	really.
sd	But, I must say, that, when I did do a linguistics course in school, ages ago, the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent.
sd	and at that point that was sort of the limit but since then I've been abroad a lot,
o@	so. It's a mixture.
sd	In Santa Barbara.
sv	I think we've probably know each other's exercise habits
fc	and, it was nice talking to you.
fc	okay.
qy	Are we tonight?
qw	What do you like to do in your spare time?
sv	Actually, it's a cherished commodity now days,
ba	great.
b	Uh huh.
qw	What kind of music?
bk	okay.
sd	I enjoy that.
sd	and the biggest hobbies I have right now are my kids and whatever they are involved in.
sd	and so a lot of the hobbies that I have right now are centered around my children and also things that my wife and I like to do together.
sd	so personally a lot of the hobbies I had when I was growing up and, going to college and so forth are having to change.
sd	there's not a whole lot of mountains here in Texas that I can go skiing with that right now,
sd	but hopefully I will be able to get back to the slopes some day
qy	You didn't?
aa	That's true.
sd	My two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing.
sd	and we would go skiing and enjoy that.
sd	and I am finding out, a lot of the spare time that I had isn't there.
sd	it's, taken up by activities with, work, with family, with, civic and Church responsibilities for me.
b^r	yeah
ba	Well, great.
qy	So you have participated with that in the past?
qy^r	Have you participated in that in the past?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It sounds like her life is full too.
sv	I imagine your life is full taking them around all over the place. mention tonight
fc	or,
fc	Great.
fc	and you have a nice evening.
sd	and I sew
sd	I sew clothes for them every once in a while.
sd	And I make quilts.
sd	I have to put it away
sd	and then I have to bring it back.
sd	I don't know if it's looking at the little things every time.
aa	that might be it.
bh	do you?
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I can do it with a needle and thread you know, and get about five small stitches in, which is pretty good,
sd	but it's very long.
sd	It's very tedious if you don't have a whole group, you're not finishing a quilt in a long time .
sd	So, I like to just mostly do the tie quilts.
sd	That's so much easier.
sd	instead of, like, yarn they tied, ribbon into it.
sd	And it's real pretty.
sd^r	It's real pretty.
ba	wow.
qy	Now did you say you could knit?
b	Oh.
sv	Well, I was going to say because, Because if you could knit, you could crochet.
sv	It's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to weave the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand.
sv	And then you just use your right hand with the hook.
sv	You could learn that, I'm sure and pick that up.
sv	I think if you can do any handicraft, you can learn to crochet.
sd	It's not too difficult.
b	Yeah
qh	Isn't that interesting.
sv	I think that's really interesting.
sd	and there are some beautiful, just gorgeous patterns that people do.
sv	And a lot of people don't do that either.
sd	You know, and I always think, well, I can do this and watch T V or something you know.
sd	and then it doesn't quite work
sd	I can sketch something, like if I see a picture, like, out of a book, I can sketch that
sd	, I can't draw it out of my own head kind of thing.
sd	and yet I can't do, you know, like, craft, on wood.
sd	I can't do that painting thing.
sd	I know a woman who's just wonderful at that.
sd	I guess that's the only way I could do it.
qw	so, what are your favorite T V shows?
qy	do you like that?
qw	When was that on?
qy	On A B C?
sv	well, it may be that, it was recently replaced, by actually by what may be my favorite T V show TWIN PEAKS.
h	So, I don't know.
sd	I don't think that was on A B C, anyway I don't know what happened to it though.
sv	And there's a lot of those Blair shows floating around.
ny	Yeah.
qy	Do you like the law shows
sv	also saves a lot of time with commercials.
sd	I guess it's on late Saturday nights or something,
sd	that's entering the day as well.
qy	have, have you seen this often?
bh	really?
b	Yeah.
sd@	I don't know that. / * don't = didn't
sv	I don't see any difference though,
sd	I live in, , Rochester, New York,
ny	Yes.
qw	Where are you?
sd	I think the AMERICAN GLADIATORS is on Sunday afternoons actually around here as well, sometimes.
o@	I know I've seen it during the day in Florida. When I was at my parents down there.
sv	I think it's something completely new.
o@	Well, Yeah,
sv	and I think that people sort of learn good sportsmanship and so forth.
sd	they, leaned away from that sort of,
qy^d	that's how they do it.
bh	Really?
sv	I just thought they had some,
ba	that's great.
qy^g	they win money I think, don't they?
bh	Really?
qy^d	All that for getting tennis balls shot at you at a hundred miles an hour.
sv	I actually feel the tennis balls would hurt.
qy	there anything else?
br	Huh?
b	Okay.
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
sv	But, I'm sure that's fun.
sd	well, they seem to be on later,
sd	I tend to, if nothing else is in the town television at eleven o'clock just to watch the news, and or NIGHTLINE or something, just sort of get you know, a good, a good think for the day.
qw	When is yours on?
fa	well, I'm sorry I interrupted,
sd	ours is on,
qy	so, does your prime time start at seven o'clock?
nn^r	no,
qr	so, like, you know, the regular television shows that are very popular, do they start at, seven or at eight?
sd	because that would the eight o'clock here.
sv@	but then at eight o'clock is when everything starts. which is strange, I mean, because yours start at seven and end to ten
sd	and ours start at, at, at eight and end at eleven,
ba	that's great.
qy	Do you watch CHEERS
o	Okay.
sd	that's about it.
ny^r	uh huh.
sv	And I think that's what companies are doing, more and more because there are products that are out there.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	sure.
sd	The only thing is,
sv	the one issue that I would take stands with is the fact that the drug testing itself can be done on a person that is actually not on drugs and come out positive.
sv	and the Advil will, apparently, come out positive as if they smoked marijuana.
qw	you know how can how you can do it?
aa	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
qw	Where there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person, is on drugs
qy	you know what I'm saying?
b	Uh huh.
ad	So, tell me about changes from say twenty years ago, since you were an adult, twenty years ago.
sd	Well, you're able to, you're able to, vote and go to war and things like that
sd	that's one of the changes .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
qy	Did it work?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv@	So less, you think now there's less of a social movement and lots of individual movements. In a sense.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	instead there's been sort of an increasing, I don't know, Japan bashing and things like that.
sv	I see among some of my friends and even more among some of my students, who are, you know, maybe twenty, a real sense of, you know, America's losing it.
sv	and there's a notion of fairness.
sv	while still far from perfect, is much more established, I think.
sv	It's human nature
b^r	yeah
b@	Yes . Uh huh.
b^r	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	And that's a real change, except it sort of, brings back to the nineteen forties more than anything else .
sv	I mean, all this recycling used to be in tact, * typo in tact should be 'intact' or not all of it,
sd	I mean, recycling was a wartime thing.
aa	Yes .
b	Uh huh.
aap	A perceived decline anyway, yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv(^q)	this is the way of let's make fun of the teachers those are the people who can't do anything.
sv	And if you have that kind of social attitude it's hard to get sufficient numbers of people who are going to overlook all of that work for lower pay, work for low social prestige, just because they care about good education.
sv	And you get more and more people and up there because it's the safety net of those of, you know, average intelligence or something, they can always teach.
sv	and, I'd really like to see stability in that area, because I'm always afraid that's where another big war is going to start. Not that Desert Storm was a small one.
sd	actually I heard that the Israelis at least mentioned about giving up some of the Golan Heights.
ny	Yeah.
b	Okay.
sv	Well, I guess it's one of those things that, if it's going to really promote a lasting peace, if there is not going to be a peace,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
qy	Do you think the U S is going to wind up keeping, military bases over there?
ng	but, I haven't specifically heard anything about that.
sv	What I thought was interesting is that, apparently the formal cease fire has not actually been signed yet.
sv	And, then I guess there's still the possibility that, hostilities with, U S troops could still break out.
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you have relatives over in Israel?
b	really.
b	Yeah.
qy	does she ever want to go back to Syria?
bk	okay.
nn^r	No .
qy	Do you ever want to go over to Israel?
bk	okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	do you have a lot of Kosher foods there at your house?
ny	Yeah
sd^e	Kish ki's, or knishes .
b	Oh.
ba	I got you.
^g	right.
sd	and I used to have to go with pocketful of change to buy all this bread the kids would see me .
bd	not, Not,
bd	just, just enough to get by .
b	Okay.
b	Oh.
ba	Wow .
b	really .
sd	matter of fact I just watched Charles Heston this weekend in the TEN COMMANDMENTS.
qy	Did you?
sv	But, you know, emotionally I have a real difficult time believing that, that people that believe in God and love, not war and to forgive can't get together.
sd	But I mean, even within the Muslim, religions, different sects, they can't get together.
b	Yeah.
bf	Or, you know, the Catholics and the Protestants up in Ireland.
qy	You know, I mean,
b	Yeah.
b^r	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	it sounds like a John Lennon, type.
o	Okay.
sd^e	I love to fish.
sd	Well, it's mostly from the rivers and lakes.
sd	I don't like to go out on boats.
sd@	down here we usually catch catfish and bass, stripped bass, you know, where I fish. And trout up at, Lake Shasta when I go up there.
sd	I think I had rather have a catfish than I would a trout .
b	Uh huh.
qy	See. Well, like in, Iowa and Nebraska, those little bullheads, they look just like catfish,
sd	You know that's what I mean cause I am from Iowa.
sd	they look just like baby catfish.
qy	You know, did you get to go fishing very often?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Well, you like to eat them after you catch them?
sv@	but they don't like to eat them. You know.
sd@	If I go to a restaurant and order fish, it's usually either salmon or, red snapper. You know .
sd	We, skin them.
ny	Yeah.
sd	and then I just, flour them, salt and pepper them and cook them.
sd	I don't put that corn meal on them.
sd	You know, that's the way my mother taught me to fry them
b	Uh huh.
sd	most of them are just the small, you know, pan frying ones.
qy	Wouldn't that be something?
qy^g@	It's a thrill when you get a big fish though, isn't it? You know.
^g	Nebraska?
qy^d	So, it was just like the rivers and, the lakes I suppose,
ny	Yeah.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	So, Jan, how do they recycle in Texas?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	Is it, is it all voluntary?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	There's, a lot of projects where the Boy Scouts and things, that will, collect your cans
o@	and, it's a good fund raiser for the kids.
sd	you see, I guess it depends on your landfill space.
sd	and my parents are forced recycling,
sd@	they ha , all plastic has to go into a recycling bin, all cans have to be recycled, all newspapers has to be recycled. Because they're just running out of space and landfills.
sv	they're using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones.
sd	and we dump them off there.
sd^e	It's still voluntary, though I think we're supposed to have something implemented by nineteen ninety three, though where some aspects will be mandatory.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Mostly just the cans.
sv	and most of the time, like I said, that's a sort of like fund raiser things that, the schools do, or that the Boy Scouts do, or whatever.
b	Yeah.
sv	Cans are the only thing I think you really get money for.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	It was, it's one of those things,
sd	you know, and just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be, separated, you know.
nn	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	I, I work in a, speech interface lab, at a, at a college.
sd	The state of Maryland has asked all the colleges and universities, and some of the large organizations, you know, if they would definitely recycle their office paper.
o@	And, the same thing, you know, almost every college in Maryland is recycling office paper.
sv	and it's surprising how much you never realize, because that janitor comes around and empties your garbage, can every night.
o@	and, you just can't believe how much paper that you,
sv	Reams of paper come, out of an office every day . That , took us to recycle.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qy	you know, I guess a lot of the large organizations, probably T I, did they advertise on television how successful they are?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	That would probably, be true.
sd	They'll, say,
^q	And here, those of us that Dumavra Power, which is our power company, that,
^q	we now recycle forty five percent of our solid waste,
sv	so I think, you know, we're probably reaching a successful stage and just with voluntary, I think.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	We weren't, concerned.
aa	That's true.
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think really probably what hit peoples, you know, I know that here up in the, the New Englands area and also in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York, all of a sudden we're out of landfill.
o@	And, even then, you know, we're really running out of space.
sv	that all of a sudden really hit home that there's no longer landfill space, in some of the more crowded states.
sv(^q)	They're not going to voluntarily say, Hey, ship your garbage here.
o@	So, you know, realistically, you know, we really had to start, we have to start recycling in some, geographic areas.
sd	It's really, tough.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, in some ways, I guess, it doesn't become really cost saving until you have an industry around it, you know. Because, I know that, like in, Pennsylvania, they require them to, put their newspaper for recycling.
sd	But, the de inking process that they use, to take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused is very expensive,
sd	and also, it produces a waste, a, liquid waste that they don't know what to do with yet.
o@	So, even some aspects of recycling they still have cost, yeah, cost efficient, yet.
sd	So, but others, you know, like tin cans and plastics, are really, efficient, you know.
sd	They, they melt on quickly you know, just because of the, heating and things, getting glass.
sv	it really is surprising that people haven't noticed it before.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know that though, all those petroleum products though are so terrible for the water table.
sd@	, I was reading some place the you put, brake fluid normally comes in just small little pint containers. That one pint of brake fluid can contaminate so many gallons of water, you know, like hundreds of gallons of water.
qh@	and you wonder, you know, with all these oil spills. how terrible that is .
sv	So, we'll have to keep our eyes on all that, I guess.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I, agree.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I do, too.
b	Uh huh.
o@	It d , , Well, you know, if they're forced to do it it becomes sort of a habit.
qw	What do you think about gun control?
sv	Well, I guess that I would like to say that perhaps someplace in the middle where people could somehow qualify or, have a legitimate use for the, the weapon I suppose because also, living in this area, the problems in D C come home very quickly.
sv@	You know, at least there's the moral issue that they knew better. Which is sort of, you know, flaky,
b	Uh huh.
sv	Now, in a sense, that's a legal way of getting the guns,
sv	but certainly the the purpose is not very legal.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And I suppose you know, total ban would lead to more illegal weapons.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	We never had any in the house
sd	so, to me, you know, the first time I saw a gun up close was a pretty scary thing.
b	And I'm not sure that's good either.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, before I was married, I used to play a lot of sports.
sd	so I haven't done a lot of, exercise on purpose.
qo	What about you?
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
sv^e	that can be awful.
b	Uh huh.
ba@	that's good. Uh huh.
qrr	like, is it the weight machines or aerobics or what is it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I bet.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Doesn't sound like low impact.
qy	So are you moti ,
sd	but I like to, play tennis and play racquetball
sd	but, I would really like to start that again, because I am now, you know, not in a position that I like myself.
sv	you're easily tired
sd	but I'm not the kind of person that could go to a spa and work out,
sd	I mean I have so many chores and so many obligations every day for, to add another obligation would make me feel stressed.
sd	But if I have something, some team sport or some activity, then it's kind of like having fun, playing
sv	but you're doing it for fun.
o@	and, Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's nice.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and it's fun.
sv	And also, the nice thing about belonging to a club is that you can have some of the relaxation, you know, like saunas, or you know, hot Jacuzzis or whatever, they have that kind of makes it fun and stuff, you know,
sv	you can relax that way, afterwards and things.
sd	Well, I guess it's getting late.
sd	that helped motivate me .
sd	Think someone can do it.
sd	Maybe I should start thinking about it again.
o@	I thought, I shouldn't out of the blue just jump in.
sd	but I haven't done it.
fc	Well you have a good night.
fc	Bye bye.
qw	So, what kind of neat hobbies do you have?
sd	That's what everything turns.
sd	they send them to you all ready alive.
b	really.
sd	Since I've got cats, I decided to get some catnip.
sd	so I'm encouraged .
b	Yeah.
qrr	or building supplies place.
o@	and, they offer just as good a guarantee, if you buy it from them.
b	Yeah.
sd	so, I'm going to wait on those.
sd	something, to keep me occupied, you see.
sd	I'll, buy some plastic and make a little house
sd	and watch the cats tear it up.
na	they just like to get in and dig.
sd	And then my cats got into it and started digging and that took care of that.
sd	Especially the catnip.
sd	Three.
qw	But, why would it be illegal?
b	right.
sv	Well, yeah, if nobody complains you're all right.
sv	and if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway.
sv	You know, you don't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property.
b^m	right here, Bambi .
t1	what else do I, mostly just computer stuff.
sd	I like to think that I'm a very good cook.
sv	you don't have a lot of time.
sd	and raising cats.
sd	Well, it started out as a hobby actually.
sd	And now it developed in to going to cat shows and finding studs for them, and, you know, all this kind of stuff.
sd	I've got a Bombay, a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian.
sd	Only going to breed them once.
sd	And, she's not feeling too great today.
sv	and I, I just think that I don't know, it's kind of cruel.
sv	and, you're never rea ,
sv	and so you end up with, you know, kind of strange kittens.
sd	And I just don't like that.
ng	we sold all that litter,
sd	there's not that much call for Bombays.
sd	but they're not, they're not show cats.
sd	so all you can do is sell them as pet quality.
sv	They want things like Himie Persians and Turkish Vans.
sd	he's mostly white with, brown and black patches.
sd	and we'll end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those.
sd	we want to breed her with a champion,
sd^e	the Persian is,
sd	and the other two are short hairs.
sd	Going to have some nice kittens, I hope.
sd	but she has chocolate, paws, chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters.
sd	she's quite attractive looking.
sd	hope the stud will find her attractive.
sd	so that the silver will be predominate in the kittens.
sd(^q)	can't just go out there and say, okay, you guys breed, you know .
aa	That's right.
sd	And I don't like Devon Rexes at first.
sd	it comes from England and, in the county of Devon.
sd	It's curly, as a matter of fact.
qw	what kind of fishing do you do?
b	Uh huh.
sd	That's one of the few things I've ever fished for is rainbow trout.
qw	what kind of bait do you use to catch them?
bh	really?
b^m	Fish eggs?
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I didn't know that.
ba	That's a great way.
sd@	also. look, catfish,
sd	personally I like to catch large mouth bass and catfish because they fight the best .
sd	But a catfish will really just tear into anything like that, like liver or, cheese or anything that smells terrible .
sd^e	Actually I always used to go to my grandparents' in Oklahoma
sd	and what we'd do is let the line all the way to the bottom and crank up, you know turns on the reel about six to twelve times
sd	and the fish would be sitting at different levels.
sd	And if you left it on the bottom, there was a good chance that you'd catch catfish.
sd	And, of course, depending on how big your bait was, you know, would be depending on what you caught.
sd	and we used to have a light at the top of the water.
sd	He'd really spoiled me in that respect.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	do you have any friends with ponds?
sv	seems like every time somebody's on the bank, all they want to do is throw it out just as far as they can and, bring it in to you.
sd	you want to make it land right on the shore and then drag like a plastic worm and just have it come into the water like a regular animal or fish well, you know, something coming off from the bank like they usually do .
sd	So you don't have to really get, fish from a boat, you know, because they're actually right there at the shore.
sd	I am now .
b	yeah
sd	but the key is to always have your line tight.
sd	and believe me you'll know the difference.
sd	crappie actually.
sd	And I also like Spanish mackerel.
qy	Have you ever fished off the pier?
sd	they have like yellow, fuzz on a hook, you know, that kind of comes out.
b	Yeah.
sd	and they're bigger.
ad	Get the yellow ones.
aa	Those are the ticket .
sd	You don't even have to have a good rod or anything. just even a regular line
sd	and they're all silver, something real shiny about that long.
sd	They'll go after that in a heartbeat also. Just anything that really shines or spins.
sd	That's it.
bh	really?
ba	That's neat.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I have not even heard, believe it or not, of that person.
sd	when you said it, it was kind of like a surprise.
sv@	I think mainly because I haven't been watching what's politically going on. you know, in that aspect.
sd	like now, the new house bill that went to Minnesota, being that it is their neighboring state and that I lived in Minnesota, I'm more familiar with the politics that involved with that, and that being passed.
sd	 it gets harder and harder each time an election comes up like that, to make the decision on who would be the best to run.
o@	 Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Sure.
sd	I mean, they were not rich in in any means
sv	and it has been kind of, in the past, I don't know, maybe fifty years that in order for a person to get involved with politics, they've had to have money.
sv	And you had to have the views of the people that were going to be paying your way.
sd	you think of Abraham Lincoln and, you know, just the background of Abraham Lincoln. You know, teaching himself to read.
sd	He didn't come from money.
b	sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
sv	So you really know a lot of his background.
sv	It's the one that everybody wants.
sd	I really have to ask them why, you know.
sv	I mean you have to go through so many different,
sd	you have to go the House, the Congress, and all of the other things to get a bill passed.
sv	and I think long time ago presidents did have a lot of power.
sd^t	And, I've pressed the button.
b^m	You haven't been to too many places.
sd	I have been to Hawaii.
sd	It is beautiful.
sd	Well, there is a lot of Japanese over there.
b	Uh huh.
sd@	But there is still a lot of beautiful places to go and see. You know, On all of the islands. You know,
sd	Oahu naturally has got more people on it than the other islands.
ad	You have got to see at least once.
sd	I like Maui.
sd@	and it is really nice. Where the island of Hawaii, you can't really lay on the beach over there.
sd	but I don't know, just not nice as Maui.
qw	And then, where have you been?
bh	you have?
b	Oh.
qw	How long ago?
b	Okay.
sd@	I know where that is at. Because I use to live in Oakland.
b^r	Right.
ny^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	right.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Did you go on the cable cars and everything?
qy	Isn't that fun?
sd	Up by Napa.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I love it down there.
b	Uh huh.
^2	the weather.
sd	Well I have also been to the Carribean.
sd	Well I, have been there a couple of times.
sd	I went on a cruise.
sd	The last time I went, I went with my two sisters.
sd	And it was over Christmas time.
sd	And we really had a good time.
sd	and they had put a Christmas tree on the beach decorated it up.
sd	it was a lot of fun.
ny	yeah.
sd	You put your clothes in your room,
ad	you will have to go on one.
nn	No.
sd	some people did, on that last cruise that we took because they was having a storm come in
sd	but that is unusual.
sd@	and I didn't. You know
sd	and they just do so many things for you, you know, to make you enjoy the trip and everything.
sd	but I want to go to Alaska.
b^r	Uh huh.
bh	really?
b	Right.
aa	I think I would like to, too.
sd	I keep hoping to win the lottery where I can do all these things. You know.
sd	so. So, I was thinking about a couple things, and whether they are serious.
sv	I guess the biggest thing that bothers me is,
sv	but one of the things that bothers me is the credit information, situation, that you find yourself almost compromised into giving if you want any sort of credit, extensive checks and things of that nature.
sd	but I don't know whether, some of the questions they ask are legitimate because they are the ones who are making the profit out of your ,
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well I guess then it's just the big brother concept of the fact, that once you give your social security number there are people I guess who are, actually collecting all this all the time
o@	and, and profiles are given.
sd	I read the other day that, these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone all they need now is your telephone number, which I guess is involved in this controversy of whether they can reveal your telephone number or not.
sv	I, I feel that is an invasion of privacy
b	Yeah.
aa	exactly.
b	Yeah.
ba@	My God. Yeah.
sd	I have a particular subject that not everyone agrees with me,
sd	I make my living by, flying airplanes for, for a company.
sd	And, as an airline pilot I have to take random drug testing.
sd	so when I finish a certain flight on a random basis I have to, have a drug test
sd	and, and that's without probably cause,
sd	and one of them was a bad test,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	righ ,
b	Yeah.
b	right.
aa	I am.
b	Yeah.
sd	I can understand the public's alarm to it,
co	but now, try to get the damn thing repealed, you know.
sv	doesn't seem the courts,
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
sd^t	but that was part of the question,
sv	I do feel the courts have held up a great deal of our privacy, I mean particularly look in some of the, in some of the,
sd	I notice in some of the sexual cases they've held up a great deal of privacy, which I support of course,
sv	you have to answer these questions, of course.
sd	and I don't really know how serious it is, except I don't like it .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
br	What was that?
bk^r	yeah.
b	Right.
sv	and the next thing you know then, there's always the need to go and inspect lockers of high school students,
sd	you just moved to Texas from Minneapolis.
sv	I don't, I don't hold out much hope for you.
sd	in at least in criminal law some of the, latitudes that the police had,
bk	Oh yeah.
b	Yeah.
b@	 Yeah.
sd	Well, I mean, I don't understand,
qh	if they don't make a criminal check, why do you have to be fingerprinted.
qy^g	Well that's rather unusual, isn't it.
sv	and then if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the street.
bh	they do?
sv	Well there's all sorts of scare tactics, I guess, to, to invade our privacy
b	Yeah.
sd	I just going to say, NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR, is come and gone
sv	but it's here.
sd	The computer abilities store that information.
fp	And a very good afternoon to you.
qrr	or do you, have a lot of people come in and have to prepare for them?
qy^g	Now you're in Dallas, is it?
b	Okay.
sd	I was thinking in terms of Mexican almost, Tex Mex.
sd	and when I go out to eat dinner sometimes that's the type of foods I like to find.
sd	or in these different restaurants in this area that, have all this fine Mexican foods.
sd	but, actually I never get too much fried chicken.
sd@	But I would have fried chicken, with reasonably hot sauce on it. Almost a Mexican type thing.
qy@	Have you ever had twice cooked potatoes? with a cream made of the sour cream and cream cheese and, a little oleo and I use, oregano and maybe dill weed, mixed in with it.
sd	And, I like broccoli casseroles which would include onion and cheese and more dill weed and some medium hot peppers.
sd	As you can see, I'm inclined towards the Mexican type of a meal .
sd	And I would probably have some quiet and gentle fried onion rings mixed in there with it too.
qo	So, how would you improve upon that?
b^m	More fresh vegetables?
qy	Included to that?
qw	How do you cook your green beans?
ny	Uh huh.
bf	what you use and in herbs and so forth.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Have you ever tried Chinese type green beans?
sd	We use soy sauce,
sd	and you also have a little cream sauce in there because you you would use the, water and,
qw	golly. What's this white powder that, that you mix with water and gives a thick sauce?
sd	I can't even think of the name of that right at the moment.
fa	sorry about my mind.
sd	But, it does make a nice thick creamy sauce with the green beans
sd	and then you have a nice soy sauce taste under it with a few onions in there with it.
sd	it brings out so much different things in, in the string beans.
sd@	I hardly ever cook them the same way twice. Just so I can enjoy them.
ad	So you might, think about that.
sv	Chinese cooking actually has a lot of very delicious tastes to them.
sd	And, north African cooking is good when you use something called couscous.
sv	You probably have to buy that from specialty stores.
sd	They eat it one to two meals everyday in north Africa.
sd	It makes a fantastic, salad with cucumbers and, olive oil and onions
fc	and, that's one thing we can enjoy is good delicious food.
fc	Well, thank you very much Miss Diane.
fc	Bye bye.
sd^t	Okay, I guess, we are just supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time.
sd	I basically read books.
sd	And I will work on one for a little bit, you know, and then the next one.
bd	just sometimes.
sd	I have one that I was reading on, raising your children and then another one on an autobiography, and another one on, like a crime story .
sd	A true crime story.
sd	Reading that one last night.
sd	like my husband.
b	Yeah
qy^d	You must, work for T I?
sd	my husband does too.
b	Yeah.
b	really.
b	really.
b	Yeah.
qw	What kinds of things do you fix?
qy	And you have a shop?
b	Yeah.
^2	you can fix just about everything and anything.
ba	Well, that is great.
b	Yeah.
sd	He rarely takes them in
sd	We rarely have to take those things in too.
aa	definitely.
sd	I mean during Christmas I work on, you know, like, holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things.
bd	but, not really .
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I belong to this organization if you have preschool children
sd	and, every once and a while they will have a craft, section for the moms
sd	and we learn to do the, transfer pictures on the sweatshirts transfer photos
sd	So we learn different crafts like that ,
b	Yeah.
sd^e	I cook dinner .
sv	I don't consider it a hobby .
sd	I am not a real elaborate cook or anything like that unfortunately.
sd	but it's not anything elaborate, you know .
sd	At least, I don't think it is.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	You have a computer at home?
ba	good.
b	really.
qy^d	Then you are busy .
ba	that is very good.
sd	the book is so detailed
qy	do you have children?
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
aa	Uh huh.
bf	And you had trouble finding somewhere for him to be before he was five.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	, even not only toddlers but, you know, even your older children.
bf	It's hard to find anywhere they're really going to learn something.
sv	the better the place, the more you're going to pay.
aa	very true.
b	Uh huh.
sd	If I had any children I hope that I'll be in a position to stay home with my child because I'm not real, trusting , a lot of people, especially today.
sd	and I just see different things all the time,
h	and, and I don't, you know,
sd	it takes me a long time to just trust someone as a friend, much less to, you know, trust someone with my child.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I guess that's the best way, you know, to get, recommendations from your friends or, family members.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I mean not that they're going to abuse your child or anything, but you just have to be sure that they're going to be watching them, you know, that they wouldn't let them drink something or, you know, eat something off the floor, you know,
sd	just simple things, that can be harmful.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and also, senior care facilities, you know, you hear abuse.
sv	and you almost want to, you know, spend a couple of weeks in class with your child just to see how it is or something.
nn	Huh uh.
nn	No.
o@	so I, still have a little bit of time,
sd	I'm trying to get my career going.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	you would hope that maybe they'd come home and know some of their A B C's or something, you know,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qy	Did you take this same, route with your other two children?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And it helps that he has older brothers, you know, just to have role models and things like that.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's excellent.
b	Uh huh
qh	Well, what kid isn't , these days,
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do they have any kind of program like at T I or wherever your wife works, some in kind of day care?
sd	because I know they're putting that into a lot of, corporations now.
b	Right.
sd	So, maybe that will be an option for,
sd	But then I foresee that being just a baby sitting thing not much learning but, you know, kind of somebody to just watch your kid while your at work.
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
qrr	or is it better the other way with a lot of different,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Huh.
b	huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	each child is individual, in life learning and things.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, it sounds good,
sd	sounds like he's doing real well.
ba	good.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And they'll probably sit him in front of the television, you know, while they do other things,
b@	Huh. Yeah.
ba^r	that's good.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	right.
sd	That's probably what I'll try and look for whenever I do have my children,
sd	I don't know when that will be,
sd	it will take me a long time to find somewhere I'm sure, just because I just want to be, I want to be so positive that, you know, my children are okay, as well as the other children in the center, you know.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it's a lot more difficult these days because you have both parents working a lot of times,
sv	and, so, you have to find day care, whereas, you know, here,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	so child care's a necessity, whereas years ago, you know, the husband basically worked and the wife, basically stayed home.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think that has a lot to do with just all children how they learn and things just because the basic family is breaking, you know,
sv	the basic family is not there anymore.
sv	I think that plays a big part in a child's learning and, you know, what they can and cannot do in child care.
sd	currently, I'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program.
sd	All this space that normally would be dedicated towards the, exercise area, is covered in boxes.
sd	Well, I had, a little routine that I did for warm ups.
sd	I'm not trying to make big bulging muscles, just trying to try and stay as firm as I can stay in my old age .
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
sd	I have three left living at home.
sd	And they do take up a big part of my evening and weekend.
sv	And it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself, too.
sv	when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children.
b	Yeah.
sv	what I found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself.
sv	but basically, the healthier you stay, the longer you'll live.
sv	And those people that I'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now, well, you know, get the enjoyment of me, years past where I would have been if I wouldn't have taken it.
sv	If you kind of think of it as a rationale like that, it works out fine.
b	Huh uh.
sd	and I found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water.
sd	and I've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty three.
sd	And, it's amazing, that, you know, prior to like nineteen twenty there were very few heart attacks.
sd	You can usually find it in a health food store.
sd	I used live in Plano.
sd	or even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now,
sd	He did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours. And, proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis, which is the, clogging of the arteries.
sd	well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol.
sd	And, E P A never published that report.
sd^r	CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL AND CHLORINE.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	And a lot of the myths they've been passing around, people are starting to realize aren't true.
sd	I mean, I'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that, because that's good for you,
sv	but to think that solely, alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is just hard to believe.
b	Huh uh.
sd	I actually eat pretty much anything that I want.
sd	and I've never been above, like, you know, one hundred and fifty, never.
sv	You know, they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued.
sd	I work at the T I site in Hunt Valley, Maryland.
sd	and, you know, I've always come out aces.
sd	but I do eat, you know, some health cookies that are high in fiber, low in fat and all that kind of stuff.
fp	it certainly is, going to be a pleasure to chat with you.
sd^t	Normally I talk to people in Plano, Texas.
qw^t	How did you get on this list?
qo	What ideas do you have on that, Doug?
qw	In what manner?
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, the thing that I thought they were, concerned about was people calling on the phone from all over the country to sell you something
sv	To me that's an invasion of privacy.
b	Uh huh.
br^m	You mean your history in regards to, the charge card company or something like that?
qy	Do you consider these serious, problems?
qrr	or what could be done about it, do you think to correct it?
na	Well, I would think that, information held on records, by any company or charge card dealer or person should be absolutely private and not be allowed to be, given out by those companies.
sd	I mean, it should be made a, national or a state law to protect people so that, you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies.
sv	In other words, if you call the company yourself, directly, and then know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be available to anyone else, you know, from the outside, so to speak then you would feel more free to go into detail with them
sd	but we have no control of that now
qr	I was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood, independence, or the status quo for Puerto Rico.
sd	I did Peace Corps training there.
sd	and, I guess I have never thought to ask her what she favors,
sd	So, I don't know how the U. S. would cope with, a new state that is so very, very poor.
sv	I suppose or the whole, new state would require such aid.
na	I think so.
sd	I'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory.
ad@	Perhaps compulsory education. and taxes .
sd	So, if they've just taken such action, it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state, or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish, or Hispanic heritage.
na	I believe I would probably tend towards that.
qh	What about if, they demanded to have Spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And so, obviously it didn't work in California.
b	Right.
b	Right.
ba	I see.
b^r	uh huh.
fc	well thank you very much.
oo^t	And I guess, the suggestion is that we maybe talk about a menu for a dinner party, if we wanted to do something like that or, share recipes or something,
qy	Are you one who gives dinner parties very often?
sd^e	nor am I.
sd	that is for sure.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah.
b^r	uh huh.
b	yes.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I mean, I guess after many years of doing it, you just, kind of do it second nature.
qy^g	She enjoyed it, .
sd	Well, there is a woman in our choir, who is nearly famous for her apple pies,
sd	excuse me, and, one of her pies was auctioned for fifty dollars .
sd	but I do recall that it was quite good,
sd	that was more my specialty, I suppose.
sv	pies would go practically, in a day's time .
b	Yes.
b	Right .
sd	and she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend, for friends of hers.
qy	Have you ever made that or had it?
sd	I had, used to work with a gentleman who was from Cuba, who would make it, 
sd	It's like, an egg custard in a caramelized sugar, with on top of it.
sd	but it's very, very high in cholesterol, I am sure with all the eggs that are in it.
sd	and flan is almost, a basic with every meal that you get, there.
ny	uh huh.
sd	So if you ever run into that you will sort, of be aware of what that is all about.
sd	but, you know, sopapillas, I guess, would be another kind of a dessert, if you decided to do something like that.
sd	flan is something you can, make ahead and you know, have ready
sv	it's one of those things where it does require some real, planning
sv	you have the house to clean and, you know, the whole business that goes with it.
sd	the house needs cleaning, I guess I had better have a dinner party .
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
fe	Good heavens .
ba	wow.
sd	That is such a nice thing,
sd	and, then } I got so involved and so busy, I said "this is one luxury I am going to let myself have every now and then".
sd	but for me it was wonderful .
sv	and it buys you time to do other things, like have a dinner party, I guess.
sd	So, it is just a real gift of time as far as I am concerned,
sd	I have heard about that.
sd	I do not know that it has egg in it.
b	uh huh.
qy	Do you have it right on the top of you head? .
sd	You do not have it,
b	Right.
ba	quite large,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	what is it about the, the vinegar that, makes, the crust better.
ba	Interesting.
ba	boy, that's the real secret.
sd	and so I decided to bake about four pies ahead, you know, and freeze them,
sd	Those were the toughest or apple, pie crust, I have ever, ever made.
qw	Where about?
sd	Well, we lived in Plymouth for four years,
sd	and, I worked for the weekly newspaper there, the, the Plymouth, what was it called, CRIER.
sd	so he was born and, raised up there.
qy	so, Are you originally from Michigan
b	Uh huh.
qw^t	our topic today?
sd	My wife's a school teacher
sv	I don't think the teachers get enough support, quite honestly.
sd	and, of course, like everyone, she has kids that get pregnant even in the seventh grade.
sd	Plano School System.
sv	I don't think that's right, especially if they're interrupting the class and preventing other kids from learning.
aa	Yes.
b	Sure.
sd	that was more than his college tuition was
sv	But I'll tell you what, there, there are a few faults, to say the least, in the school systems today.
sv	I think we have that problem dealing in most areas, which is unfortunate.
aa	You bet.
qw	What kind of books do you like best?
sd	I don't think I've read it.
sd	Well, I'm a Tom Clancy fan.
sd	I do a lot of computer reading
sd	so, I do more work kind of related reading than, just for enjoyment.
ba	Well, that's pretty good.
sd	I've had them like that before, too.
qy	Any particular writer?
^2	Ludwig,
aa	Yes.
qw@	What does he write? Oh.
sd	So, you kind of learn something as well as enjoy yourself.
^2	RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK stuff.
b	Oh.
qw	What, what time is it there, ten thirty?
sd	it's nine thirty here.
qy	PRESUMED INNOCENT?
o@	but, Oh.
qy	Is she is she kind of racy?
^2	Just feel good.
bh	really?
sd	my mother in law's a real fan of hers.
ba	well, that's nice.
sd	you mentioned Sunday school Ladonna.
qy	are you a BIBLE fan, too?
sd	I played for about eighteen years, all the way through college, and then, kind of hung them up after college,
sd^e	not quite.
o@	but, Anyway. being in Rochester, you probably like the Mets.
qy^g	boy, I think it's like one or the other, isn't it. I mean,
b	Yeah.
sd	I kind of grew up rooting for Philadelphia.
sd	I'm from New Jersey originally.
o@	so. Yeah,
qw	but, so what are the Mets going to do this year without Strawberry?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I was going to talk to you about that eighty six team .
^g	right.
^g	right.
^2	Well, his knees were bothering him,
^2	for having him out there.
b	Sure.
ba	boy.
sv	I think we were all pretty much, Astros fans, in the National League Championship Series
sd	and they were, you know, they were pretty much without having to say, they were pretty much Mets fans .
sv	they weren't scared very much, you know .
b	Yeah
b	Really.
sd	they're, they're they, they have, I think they have the best facilities in the major leagues.
sd	It's great.
b	Yeah.
sd	I think they, when Ryan struck out his five thousandth player, they squeezed about forty thousand people in there.
sd	I mean, the owner tried to move them to Florida
sd	and they're going to build a new stadium in Arlington, as a matter of fact, not even in Dallas,
sd	So that's something that we're looking forward to.
aa	case in point, Toronto.
qy	have you seen a game up there?
sv	that's probably the pattern for the future of stadiums, I think.
qw	where is Cornell University.
b^m	Ithaca.
b	Okay.
qy^g	well Rochester is like right on the shores, isn't it?
b	okay.
sv(^q)	Well, they say that from that space needle up in Toronto you can see the lights of Rochester on a clear night.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	you, you watch those games?
b	Yeah.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	but, they were fun games to watch.
sv	well, there's definitely a lot more hitting .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and then they just haven't been able to put anything together.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	and but, it'll be interesting to watch.
sd	There's several guys from our church try to go up there.
sd	well, I guess we're maybe a hundred fifty miles south of Dallas.
sd	but it takes about two hours, two and a half hours to get there.
sd	We just get right on the freeway and just go north.
sv	Well, it's so crowded up there.
ba	Golly.
qw	how far is it across the lake to Canada?
br^m	Toronto?
b	Yeah.
qrr	or do you take the ferry, or what?
b	Yeah.
sd^e	it's a beautiful city.
qy	and then, I mean, you go back to New York after school?
b	really.
qw	Well, what kind of weather are you having right now?
sd	we've been up in the, seventies, eighties, even up in the nineties a couple of weeks ago.
qy	Because of the ice?
ba	Golly.
b^m	illegal,
ba	yeah.
qy	Golfer?
sd	but I do enjoy it.
sv	I think one of the things I enjoy the most is the beauty of the golf courses.
sd	You can get out there,
sv	You can just get out there and lose yourself in it and forget everything else in the world except what you're seeing out there.
aa	it really is.
sd	You can't do anything, right .
^2@	Boy, I'm improving. . Uh huh
ng	I've never been to a major golf tournament.
sd	I, watch them on T V a lot.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I'll bet,
o@	and we have developed a tremendous number of friends that couples do this
sv	and, you know, it's fun to go on vacations and things and go to golf courses.
sv	You can meet some really neat people.
sd	I just love them.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
sv	And you just do your own thing and be relaxed and enjoy it .
bh	Really?
bh	Really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Now, my husband and all the men, I mean, they love the real competitiveness of playing for money, you know.
sd	But I'm not good enough for that .
sd	I work during the week all the time.
sd	Someday when I get where I live closer to the club and partially retired, maybe I'll, be able to play a little more
qy	do you have any experience in, finding child care?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	How many
sd	Then something happens and the adult wouldn't be able to, accommodate or take care of the kids very well.
sd	We, we, take a very close look at finding a preschool, a good preschool for our kid.
sd	it's a good way to develop relationships with other kids their age and, get to know and work with kids.
sd	We haven't had to look very carefully for child care.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
b^r	right .
sd	I want to trust the people .
sd	And hope that we can stay in this situation for awhile.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	You want to go first .
bh	Really?
sd	and I wanted to get it back off
sd	and I just found that running really made me feel good.
sd	I would rather be outside then in the gym doing this in one place.
sd	I really like that a lot.
sd	but it's with dance steps.
sd@	I feel like I'm not just exercising. Because I'm dancing
sd	My stamina is getting great for the dance floor
sd	there's a lot of positive things with it,
sd	and I just enjoy that much more too than inside.
sd	We get to spend some time together rather than I go to the gym while she does her homework.
sd	Everybody's on their way to someplace
sd	but, basically, I do it by myself in a group of maybe forty
sv	It's more motivating that way, I think.
sv	you probably wouldn't.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I can see it'll be a good break.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh
sv	I think it's worth making the time for yourself.
sv	You owe it to yourself
sv	and I think you do accomplish more after that.
sd	Now I've learned to do that
sv	you know, and I think it just benefits you all around.
sd	Because there's always more things to do.
sd	and so you know, I just feel entitled to it
sd	and I take it ,
sd^e	I've done some walking with friends in the past.
sv	But I find that when you do that, you do more chatting than you do exercise
sd	so, I don't have time like that
sd	You know, my parents are not quite at that age yet,
sd	but, but that's really about it.
qy	Have you been in that situation yet?
b	Uh huh.
bh	Did it really?
b	Yeah.
by	no.
b	Yeah.
bd	okay.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Ah.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sv	And I'm sure it's expensive.
b	Yeah.
sd	but she's in a
sd	they're apartments for senior citizens
sd	and she loves that because they arrange activities for them all day long
sd@	but she's just concerned about in the future, you know. That, she knows it's not going to be like that all the time.
sd(^q)	And she's just wondering well what's going to happen to me
qy	but you know
sd(^q)	she's kind of asking questions about well what's going to happen, this can't last forever
ny	Yeah.
sd@	but I think it is also cafeteria style. Because I really, I, I, I doubt if she rarely cooks for herself. So,
sd	so I'm assuming it's something like that too.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah.
sd	She seems to like it.
sd	so I mean, she's got her mother in town too and things like that
o@	so. Hopefully, we won't need to go that route .
b	Yeah
qw	well, what's your opinion about capital punishment?
sv	Maybe spend the money on someone who could possibly be helped.
b	Right.
br^m	beyond murder or just beyond like first degree murder?
sv^r	and, it's gets into a pretty sticky issue.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
qy	Are there some set guidelines, like only under these circumstances?
sv	Those were the only two circumstances where you could give someone the death penalty, which I think is a little too limited.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	they ruin someone else's life.
b	Uh huh.
bf@	he didn't go out with the intent of hurting someone else. Or with no regard for someone else's well being.
qy	Would you consider, capital punishment for them?
b	Uh huh.
^2	what age they're accountable, for their actions.
qw	what kind of house do you live in?
qy^d	With, with a yard and fence.
sd	I'm in an apartment in, Plano.
sd	Mine's just a one bedroom place,
sd	it's hard for me to tell, because I haven't rented in, probably twenty, twenty five years
sd	I'm getting back into apartment life,
ny	Yeah,
sd	it's hard to tell, you know, how well they've been kept up how old they are,
sd	and, they're almost five hundred a month for a one bedroom place.
sd	it does, considering that, you know, house payments are, not a whole lot more than that,
b	Yeah.
ba	Wow, that's a lot for a townhouse.
sv	But that's what happens when you get up in this area, you know, you got all these companies are up here,
sv	and, I guess they know they're going to get it,
sd	and that's about it,
sd^e	I've owned, several, built several,
sv	Well and especially around North Dallas, or at least in Plano area, they basically all look alike because Fox and Jacobs,
sd	I used to live in Wylie
sd	and it's moving north.
ny	yeah.
b	Yeah,
qw	How long have you been in this house?
b^m	Ten years.
qy	you said you were out of state for a while, was that a smaller town than Dallas area.
qw	How was it
qw	how were the house prices up there?
b	Yeah.
ba	Wow.
sd	well, you know, a lot of these people that I've talked to that are coming down from, like what I call, the back East especially from J C Penney, are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty, hundred and seventy five thousand dollar houses down here,
sv	so in a way, I guess it works both ways.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's a fact,
aa	I guess that's true.
sv	And they don't have to worry about yard upkeep if they don't hardly have any.
sd	not too many basements in Texas.
sd	I grew up in southern Oklahoma
sd	and I to this day, I don't care if I go or not,
sv	you know, if it's going to get me, it's get me.
b	Yeah.
qy	You ever thought about building a house?
qy^r	Have you ever thought about building a house?
sv	with T I it's like anybody else, you never know how long you're going to be in one place, you know,
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you work?
qy^r	Do you work?
qy	do you have kids?
qw	how do you manage both of those?
b	Yeah.
qy^d	You basically can take care of everything yourself,
qy	do you have to do all that yourself,
aa	you too.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sv	Sounds like you've already got the makings for being a general contractor,
sv	If you don't wall paper it well together, you should probably not build a house together.
o@	and, they,
sd	the building process was a lot of fun
sd	but puts a lot of strain on things.
b	Yeah.
aa	You bet.
aa	you bet.
sv	Well, to some of them I guess it doesn't matter, you know, that maybe they've got enough coming in to take care of it,
sv	you know, they've got it made,
sd	I came out of a thirty one hundred square foot two story house.
h	I don't know
o@	but  Yeah,
sv	you know, you lear , you adjust, you figure out,
sd	It's not as bad as I thought it was
sd	it's not as bad as I remembered, especially going to college and living in apartments there, you know how noisy that can be.
sd	but still,
sd	seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night
sd	You don't run into that up here, I think because there's so many, professional people, if you want to call them that that go spend all day at work
sv	and they want some quiet,
sd	and they're trying to unwind.
sd	it's a hundred and what, eighty thousand, something like that.
b	yeah.
sv	and, you're always paying for something.
sd	my home is about fifteen years old.
sd	they have scraped the, plaster off the walls, you know, with riding their little toys through it and stuff. You know,
sd	I don't know what they,
b	right.
sd	but, you know, they're just real hard on it.
sv	and then they get another one.
sd	I know there's a lot of them.
b	Yeah.
sv	Because they're always, because they're always ruining something?
qw	How old is your child?
qr	Some appliances breaking or something?
qy^d	And you said you were in Colorado Springs?
qy	Are there a lot of trailers around there?
qy	And is that what you're in?
qy^g^t	Well, then that's why you're doing this then, isn't it?
bk	okay,
sd	I'm not in T I.
sd^t	and she saw this come up on the computer screen, and ran it off. And passed it to the people that were interested.
sd^t	I know, I've been talking to people in Ohio, and, Virginia, and I think, California.
sd^e^t	it is.
qw	How does she get to work?
b	Uh huh.
sv	and I wish we could down here.
sd	and then they'd drive me to the main terminal here,
sd	then, I'd have to go to downtown Dallas and then walk over couple blocks and get on another bus to go to my school.
bf	So that's too much.
sd	but there sure are a lot of people that work down there.
o@	and, beer and wine bottles all over the place.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It's gotten big.
sd	And I didn't realize, when I moved here, that it was a separate town from Dallas .
sd	but I didn't.
sd	it's in east,
qw	where you from?
qy	Are you?
qw	So, why did you move up to Colorado?
sd	I have a friend, in Denver.
qw	What do you,
br	What?
sv	They're not owning homes, period.
b	Uh huh.
^2	It wasn't such a bad idea?
qy	So, have you got, land?
sd	so, we took turns, you know, sharing the bedroom.
sd	it was just, the little bathroom, were the thing that really bothered me because I felt real closed in.
sd	That was in the seventies.
b	Uh huh.
fa	I'm sorry.
ny	Uh huh.
qy	So have, Have you got it under ?
qy	Are you required to by law?
sd	We were down here.
sv	well, I bet it's not bad.
sd	When we bought ours we were paying three hundred twenty nine dollars.
qw	For how many years?
sv	so, it was still a lot cheaper,
sd	and we bought one of the cheapest houses, you know, a tract house.
qy^d	Which probably didn't make much difference.
qy	have a in it.
ba	That sounds good.
qy	So, if the economy gets better, are you going to get another house?
^g	No?
^g	right?
qy^d	You would?
qy^d	It would be cheaper to move that than buy another one.
qy	T I would pay to move you?
qw	So, how many years you been up there?
qy	Do you snow ski?
sd	I went rock climbing one time.
sv	I really can't disagree with it.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think that's really the only fair way to do it.
sv	you know, Junkins all the way down.
sd	I've been retired from T I about a year,
sd	I guess it had been going on, maybe almost a year, before I retired,
sv	and I think random is probably, you know, the only really fair way to do it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	absolutely.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	I don't think they'll have much choice, do you?
sv	As matter of fact, I want to believe that the, defense department more or less mandated that people, you know, who work on defense contracts, you know, do some sort of, you know, drug testing.
sv	I want to think maybe they, you know, really got some nudging from, you know, D O D to do this sort of thing.
qy^d	So you know the atmosphere, then.
b	So, yeah.
aa	I agree.
sd	I just can't disagree with you , with you know the basic premise.
sv	as far as I know, it's, you know, seems to be a fairly accurate program, as far as, you know, the testing goes.
^2	And offer you, you know, help if you need help.
aa@	I do too. Put you out on the street.
aa	That's right.
aa	ab ,
aa	That's right.
sv	Not to mention alcohol.
b^r	yep.
b	Uh huh.
sd^r	I'm sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	But a lot of people, I think, after they thought about it for awhile, and you know, weighed the pros and cons, decided, you know, it's really not a bad idea unless you're doing drugs, of course.
aa	That's right.
aa^r	yep.
^2	Or yourself
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's true.
aa	absolutely.
aa	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	right .
b	Uh huh.
bf	trickles up and down.
sv	affects a lot of people.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	I'm not sure every small company could do it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it's got to help them too.
aa	that's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	right.
sd	That's a very very, very competitive business.
sd	I just really can't disagree with you.
fc	well, it's nice to talk to you.
fc	And you take care.
fc	Bye bye.
o	Okay
sd	I do a little bit more than I think usual people do because I am here alone during the day,
sd	and I like it just for the noise .
^h	it just depends on what it is.
sd	I mean, I have my favorite things that I do,
sd	and then some fun thing to do sometime.
qo	what about you?
b	Right.
ba	Well see that's great,
b	Right.
aap	Well, I think that's partially true, too.
sv	I think you have to have the will and the,
o@	But, anyway, what would you watch, if you had, you know, this week to watch?
qy	Do you like specials?
b	Oh.
b	Oh .
b	yeah.
sd	Well, we have cable also,
sd	and sometimes you can, get the H B O specials,
sv	and sometimes those are really, pretty hysterical.
sd	So, I like to watch comedy,
o@	But, I am not, real up to date on what's going on now,
o@	but I am, hooked on, you know like
sd	Bob Newhart is still on.
sd	I watch him.
sd	And, you know, something on that level,
sd	I watch a lot, of Thirteen, THE MCLAUGHLIN GROUP,
sd	and I, I just laugh,
sv	I mean, I think that's so hysterical, these guys.
sd	it's just a lot of fun, watching that.
sd@	but it's fun. You know,
sd	I really do .
ba	now that was fabulous,
qy	and that, you know,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	I know.
o@	and, you know, if there's something like cooking shows.
sd	I really do.
ba	I know ,
sd	in fact, one of the water color shows, I know, has inspired me to take water color lessons, you know.
o@	So, you know, things like that, you get, a whole lot of exposure.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	She got you a .
b	Yeah.
sv	But she was probably depressed to begin with.
qy	You know what I mean?
b^m	grumpy to begin with.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I hate that show .
b	Yeah.
ba	Good.
qw	How old are your kids?
b	Yeah.
o@	and, so } I do not have you know, I, that influence, of the kids shows and all that,
h	but, I don't know.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sv	anyway, so you might as well not, reinforce it , you know.
o@	and of course, we did not have any of the variety, you know,
sd	kids but, all the watch RAWHIDE and all those shows.
sd	I could watch YOGI BEAR, you know,
qh	what kind of culture was that ?
sd(^q)	and everybody would be asking, did you see that, did you see how he did that
sd	and I could never participate.
qy	like I, you know,
sv@	I think then you have to replace it with other things. You know,
b	Really.
b	Yeah.
^q	Or, you go rent a video up at, the store and come home and sit down and watch it.
sd	I have got to stick in my ,
o	Okay Jerry.
sd^t	I guess, tonight's topic is about, personal computers and level of interest and your expertise.
b^r	well.
qy^t	you want me to start off?
qo	How about yourself?
b	Uh huh.
ba	All right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	yes.
sv	Sounds like you're an expert at it, too.
b	Yes.
ba	Well, that's great, be ,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	We do an awful lot of that, too with ours.
aa	Definitely agree with that.
b	Uh huh.
qy	that's a Four Eighty Six processor, too?
ba	Wow .
^2	of RAM.
b	Right .
b	okay.
sd	Well, good for her .
qy^d	You say she's a programmer also.
o	Okay.
sd	I get my current events basically from news, just because I watch, pretty much a lot of television,
sd	I like to tune to C N N because, you know, you can tune in like any time of day and pretty much get the update on, everything, in about five or ten minutes.
sd	Like in, on radio, if you hear any news at all, it's like two seconds.
sd	You know, really quickly, on regular stations.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	where do you go to school?
sd	I went to U T at Austin.
sd	so I should get all , my news from the T V.
sd	I usually don't intentionally. Although I don't intentionally turn on the television to watch news.
sd	Now, I will intentionally buy a newspaper to, to look at the news.
sd	That's about it.
sv	and the rest, you throw away.
sd	Although you paid, what, almost two dollars now to get it
b	Uh huh.
qy	is it pretty good coverage on there?
b^r	yeah.
sd	but each story is like no more than two or three lines, you know.
b	Yeah.
sv	Especially when you look for the, like, popular radio stations like mostly the music stations, news is pretty much nonexistent.
sv	They have little, teeny weeny news, breaks, you know.
sd	basically.
^h	So let's see,
sd@	The only reason I get trade journals is like if I'm looking for a job or something . Which is what I'm doing now.
sv	first you go to C N N, then you go to radio or something like that.
b^r	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	But I think that soon the paper may be kind of the only source again.
sd	And then on television, you have just the news at six and ten.
sv	And I just see that dwindling in,
^2	Than sit down and take the effort to read the paper.
sv	That's all you have time for.
sd@	and every point they make, you know. and it's all there.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	I mean it's like each story is thirty seconds, you know.
h	I don't know.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
sd	and we saw it during the war just now, is that we got all the information within minutes, you know.
sd	Whatever happened, we knew about it about the same time that they knew about it.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Because even though we do get the story right away, they were censored as to what they could tell us.
sd	And she didn't know what was happening at that time.
sd	So there's just a lot of different opinions on that.
b	Yeah.
sv	And then, too, a lot of times I think, especially on television they blow things completely out of proportion.
sd	You know, like this Kennedy thing.
sd	And you know, it's just like, okay, this is ridiculous.
qy	Sitting on a computer?
sd	I heard the little clicking.
fc	Well, it was nice talking to you.
fc^m	Okay.
fc^m	Take care.
ad^t	we can, be recorded while we talk about it.
qy	Cities have a mandatory recycling?
sd	We got like a penny a pound for them.
ba	my,
sv	you know, in the large city that if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away it's a lot of money to transport.
sv	Even aluminum,
sd	and our city will pick up our recyclables.
sd	my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of different papers and cardboards.
sd	We've had five cent deposits on our bottles for years.
sv	and it's great for the boy scouts running around, they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes.
b	Yeah.
ba	I see that.
^2	But it takes away employment from the resource
aa	I do, too.
sd	They don't either
sd	I don't want to clean the can and take the label off it, and put it in a separate bin.
sd	You know, I'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash.
sd	but I don't see so much that I can recycle.
h	so, I don't know.
sv	Instead of carrying your newspapers, when they get done with them at the end of the day, they throw them in the trash.
sd	They have a box for papers.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
sd	Well, that's a really good idea, because, like our, fruit juices for some reason when they're in a can don't come with a deposit.
sv	And they're thinking about putting a deposit on them, because you're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans, where they're so much easier just to put a deposit on it, because probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits, because they're beer and soda,
sd	So, it's a strange.
sd	It wouldn't take them much to put a stamp on the, juice cans as easily as the soda.
sv	I think they either get a penny or two pennies a can.
b	Yeah.
qy	is bottle return down there a heated debate?
"	well, here you can't drink,
sv	and, their problem's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits see how they handle it,
sd	and then do it that way. Because, like I say, people are making money on it.
qo	so what do you think of the Giants?
b	Yeah.
qh	wasn't that something of him.
sd	really proud of him though, the way he's, you know.
aa	really, you know.
sd	I just don't understand why they're not right up there on the top you know.
sd	I had been to more games at the A s than I have in the Giants because, I lived in Oakland you know, for some time.
sd	But, I still like the Giants, though, you know .
b	right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I prefer football over baseball,
o@	but, Yeah,
bf	So, hot dogs, baseball and apple pie.
qw	So what do you think is going to happen this year to the teams?
ba	I know.
b	Yeah,
^2	makes you sick, doesn't it?
ny	Yes.
sv	He's like a little bitty kid,
sd	well, I guess the Giants might move away from San Francisco, it sounds like.
sd	but San Francisco will be hurting, anyhow.
qy	You know.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
qh	I know, isn't that something
sd	I couldn't believe that,
b	Yeah,
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I couldn't believe that, you know.
sd	That would drive you up a wall.
qy	You know.
aa	well, you're right .
bh	really?
b^r	uh huh.
b	right.
qy	So, the topic is vacations?
sd	I enjoy them.
sd	the last was back down to Lubbock to visit parents.
sd	The last one was back down to Lubbock, Texas, to visit family.
sd	But that's not the tradition for us.
sd	we enjoyed Yellow Stone real well last year.
b	Yeah.
sd	Rocky Mountain National Park.
sd	you know, there's camping and fishing and hiking and wildlife watching
sd	we usually try and drive up there, once every year or two.
na	Sure.
na^r	sure.
sd	it's a beautiful drive.
sv	Now I admit up there, the altitude is kind of interesting,
sd	but it's fun. You know, take along a picnic lunch
sd	we love it.
sd^e@	they're only I mean to the west of us. Here in the Springs,
sd	You know, and once a week we drive up into the mountains, you know, usually once a week, once every other week.
sd	I've been in Sherman.
sd^e	but just a little day thing on business.
ba	that's nice.
qy	Did you enjoy it?
qy^r	Did you enjoy it?
b	Uh huh.
bf	got to eat some different kinds of foods and meet people from a different culture
b	Oh.
b	Huh.
sd	So the place that we've gone on vacation that I think I enjoyed the most, was Seattle.
sd	was, two years ago, we went during the drought.
sd	It had been dry for a whole week.
sd	It didn't rain for a whole week.
sd	and I think we ate seafood every meal for, well, not quite every meal, but most meals for a week.
sd	It's very interesting.
ny	Yeah.
sd	and, went to the Seattle Aquarium.
sd	and you walk down in a dome, a glass dome,
sd	and you, and you can watch the fish swim by and sharks
sd	and then there's walrus and sea lion and porpoises, and it's, it's amazing.
na	absolutely.
sv	and the mountains, the mountains to the east of Seattle, are just incredible.
sd	I rode a ferry for the first time in my life.
sd	You know, up there, you go from the mainland to a whole bunch of islands around there by ferry, Instead of by bridge.
sd	and you have a beer, or coffee, or whatever, depending on the time of day.
sd	It's amazing.
ny	Yes.
ny	Yes.
sd	And there are people, literally that everyday, take the ferry, you know, and drive, on to it,
sd	live on an island off shore from Seattle.
sd	They go upstairs and have their morning coffee.
sd	Take, for the twenty to, hour and ten minutes that it takes to get across and, you know, depending on where it is.
sd	Well, in some places, you know, in some areas, you know, depends on how far they are commuting.
sd	I'm a West Texan.
sv@	Out there in the land of no water. And, to think that people live on the water daily, is kind of odd to me.
sd	You know, it's a different life style than we are used to.
sd	Galveston.
sd	I forget the name of the island,
sd	but it's a bird sanctuary, with all kinds of wild birds. Whooping and sand hill cranes, and ducks and pelicans
sd@	I like the Rio Grande Valley. Real well.
sv	Of course, you haven't lived until you have been to San Antone, to the, to the Alamo.
sd	the river walk.
sd	it's just simply beautiful.
sd	And, of course, always when I lived in West Texas, had to annually go down to San Antone just,
o@	and. * should be slash unit El Paso is kind of neat in kind of a funny way. / * should be slash unit
sd	the Davis Mountains are interesting, out there in West Texas.
sv	now the right time of year to go there is in the middle of winter, because, there's a beauty to the desert that it can best be appreciated when you are not burning up.
sv	You know, whenever you've been kind of cold where you are at. It's most enjoyable, you know, to get warm.
sd	I love the Texas Hill Country.
sv	And, Austin is neat for an occasional visit.
sd	it's a fun few days.
sd	U T is real pretty.
sd	and I guess I like a variety of restaurants.
sd	and sometimes I enjoy it's, I enjoy going out having a formal meal.
sd	And, sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad.
sd	and, sometimes it's okay to take them along.
sd	Sometimes I think we pay the baby sitter as much as paying for their dinner or lunches
sd	and it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was, just to, you know, have a moment of peace and quiet without little ones at the table.
qw	but, anyway, where do you like to eat?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
qw	which one do you like?
sd	There's an Italian restaurant over by the mall, over by, Plano Parkway there,
qh	is it Campari's or something?
sd	and actually we went in there for lunch one day.
sd	And, their pastas were great.
sv	You're brave .
ba	God.
b	Right.
sv	I don't think so .
sv	well. Even though traditional it can backfire.
sd	You know what, we read the, D MAGAZINE
sd	we check that and, the Friday section in the newspaper the pull out section there.
sd	They often do ratings of restaurants,
sd	we've usually, we often save those and ventured out on, from there, just for something that had a high rating.
b	Okay.
aa	That's, That's right.
ba^r	good.
aa^r	That's true.
aa^r	Right.
sv	, sometimes I think going out to eat it's sort of a recreation.
sv	So, just a change of pace from, eating at home.
sd	So, anyway. I guess, as far as service when we go out it's nice to have someone come and wait the table. And clear the table and,
sv	but it's not nice when they're too attentive.
sd	So, we've had experience with that, too.
sv	it may help their tip, may not,
sd	I guess just in Plano I like to go to Souper Salads.
sd	Chili's is always fine.
sd	I guess if we go into Dallas, we like, the is it Routh Street Cafe.
sv	Well well, you would like it.
sv	You'd like it especially it you're adventuresome.
sd	but, we had venison venison chili one time. Which was absolutely wonderful.
sd	well they've never had it when we've been back,
sd	it's, it's very good.
o	No.
sv	Actually, to tell you the truth, I think, jury selection is a, prime, discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on, finding of, guilt.
sd	the, peremptory challenges are limited to, I don't know how many,
sv(^q)	and I suppose an elitist might say, well, you really want someone who is well educated to be able to winnow the facts from the prejudice.
b	Right.
sv	So if you're a nincompoop on trial, you'd have to have nincompoops to,
b	Uh huh.
ny^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Matter of fact, I've heard that, I've heard that some of the information, is prevented from reaching the jury, like, mitigating circumstances or preceding, criminal record or things of this nature that,
sd	I didn't realize that.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
bf	So, what you're saying is this, if there is the second offense, then you execute them.
qo	What about, white collar crimes like, theft of trade secrets.
bh	really?
qw	Like what?
qw	How has it been this week for you?
sd	Weather wise.
b^m	damp.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It was ninety six yesterday,
sd	we're having a lot of allergies down here right now.
sd	and the weather.
sd	so. Had a lot of people out at work, you know, for fishing, and and golfing, reasons and things like that.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yes.
b	Yeah.
bh	No snow?
b	Uh huh.
sd	And, of course we are, about two hours from the northern border, straight south,
sd	I can't remember, you know, a day that I walked out and the wind wasn't blowing.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I have a brother that lives in, South Bend, Indiana.
sd	But, I didn't.
sd	originally I'm from New Mexico.
sd	and we lived in, South Bend for eight years, and, then moved to, Tennessee actually.
sd	cause I spent thirteen years there. And, then moved to Dallas about three years ago.
sd	my father was in the Air Force,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah .
qy	do you work for Texas Instruments?
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
bk	okay.
sd	and, I'm an environmental engineer,
sd^t	and, they just published this internally, you know, getting people involved.
sd(^q)	I was saying, God, do we have a TI in Maryland
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	well.
sd^t	and I always thought it's not necessary to measure your time, just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation, and, end it when needed.
aa	Uh huh.
nd	well, it's actually, waste water.
sd	but , within our department. We take care of everything. Waste water, solid waste, and recycling, and air and ,
b	uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and we take care of just the Dallas area.
sd	but, we do air modeling also.
sd	and, we have a huge chemical data base.
sv	so you probably have a job you need to get to pretty soon.
bf	you are,
qw	well how do you dress for work?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	So you're in a church there?
sd	so, I'm going to be dressing just in casual slacks and T shirts, probably not blue jeans, but little bit short of that, just tennis shoes and play clothes.
sd	but in the mornings people are dressing for work in their sweaters because they just want it to be fall so badly .
bh	Did you?
ba	I understand.
qy	Well, so are the people around you, dressing similar to you?
bf	so you don't have to buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do.
ba^r	That's good.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well that's wonderful .
sd	and even when his job is not going to be with people all day long, he said it's just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have to dress.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I think that's good.
ba	I understand.
sd	and I will run around to the store in things, in slacks and tennis shoes,
sd	but that's okay .
sd^t	Well, there's not a lot more I can think of to discuss on clothing.
sv^t	I guess this is what you call a natural end .
sd	of course, like I said, if my husband's going downtown, he's got the whole, you know, men's dress shoes
sd	we all kind of have our own little dress code of just either tennis shoes or little loafers and, tights, and things that feel comfortable to us around our kids.
sv	It's a lot different than working in a kids preschool.
fc	Well, you all have a nice day there.
ft	Thank you very much.
fc	Bye bye.
qw	Well, what are your hobbies?
qw	What kinds of, sweat shirts and T shirts do you make?
qy	Is that silk screening, or,
bk	I see.
qo	Well, how's it going?
ba	Well, that sounds great.
sv	Well, somebody has to do it,
sv	Give you a little Christmas money, any way.
sd	Well, I kind of have hobby fads, I guess.
sd	and I went ahead and sold it.
sd	I really enjoyed it.
sd	you just,
sd	and and so I bought it
sd	just kind of do it.
sd	and I bought it up there before I moved down here.
sd	there isn't too much rust on any vehicles down here.
sv^t	Well, gee I guess there really isn't too much to talk about on hobbies.
sv	and T shirt making about covers yours.
br^m	In New Mexico?
bk	Okay.
qw	How many music boxes do you have?
qy	Do they all play different songs
qrr	or do some of them play the same song?
qw	What's the most expensive one you bought?
b	really.
sd	It used to be tea spoons, was the thing.
ba	Well, that's interesting, music boxes.
qo	Well how was Europe?
qy	Was that in high school
qrr	or was that a college thing?
aa	I bet.
sv	That's where a camcorder would come in handy.
qy^g	So you haven't been back to Europe since then, huh?
qw	what does he think of your, T shirts and,
qw	what's your budget situation?
qy^g	You know, well a , actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets. Isn't it?
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	you you were born in the, in the late thirties or early forties.
b	Yeah.
ba	Well, that's good.
sd	we just got through buying a twenty five foot refrigerator, a new ceramic top stove, and a new dishwasher.
sd	and we put twenty eight hundred dollars on the charge. Along with my trip to Japan which was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars
sd	And we pay it off as it goes.
sd	So we never really get that much over extended.
sd	I mean we just we've just been spending, spending, spending.
sd	but we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've had two kids in college that just have graduated in the past year.
sd	So you know, we don't have that.
sd	but, too late, we'll never find that out.
sd	I suppose I do because I've seen a lot of those changes, the changes that women have had in well, you know, not even the last generation, the last fifteen years twenty years, going from,
sd	I'm going back too far, from my parents' generation when mom stayed home, period
sd	if you were educated you know, you might teach for a year or two before you got married.
sd	And if you really pushed it, you taught until you had kids or something you know,
sd	if you were a teacher. Then, you know, that was it, until the kids were little.
sv	there's not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the bathroom floors be on any given day.
sv	and, your kids should be totally happy in day care, because everybody else goes to day care
sv	and we have these wonderful people who are who are totally prepared to teach your child everything they need to know in day care
sv	at least for a lot of women depending on what she did.
sd	I couldn't put in enough overtime that was necess , or you know, things that would come up at work, that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on Saturdays you know, as is needed, because my husband for a long time was out of the country also with work, for like three months
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	in my case, I just, decided that, as long as my kids were little, I would be better off at home with them, instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once.
sd	Well, actually I've found out that I'm not going to go back to being an engineer.
sd	I'm, I'm a photographer now.
sd	but when I went to college I felt like I couldn't support myself if I decided to be a photographer that it would just have to be a hobby,
sd	And then I stayed home with my son, and did nothing. And found out that, you know, it was great,
sd	And I wanted something else to do,
sv	but as they get older and they're more independent, and there's things to do, then it's good for them to go to different,
sd	and so they get the socialization with other kids, you know, and not really school, but a different authority than mom, once in a while, you know, kind of learning how to deal with society.
sd	And I need it for the break.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and they're going to have to work it out to working part time.
sd	Because if I had been allowed to work, you know, maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week, I might still be working basically full time or part time, if there had been some way to work it out,
sd	because, I liked my job really well.
sd	that's what I'm doing, is working part time because I can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the, week and use those hours to do.
sd	The thing that I'm doing is taking school pictures in day cares and in Mother's Day Out programs, and also soccer teams, and, you know, different stuff like that.
sd	or my husband, you know, when he's at home, can take care of them.
sv	I think they're really going to have to, and not just for mothers, for fathers as well.
sv	It's going to have to be both.
b	Yeah.
sv	It's just convincing your husband or that it's important enough for him to do it.
sv	Because if he saw mom doing only that you know, all the time he was growing up then it's hard to think of it that I should do it or just to think about doing it rather than having someone tell him to do it.
sd(^q)	I know that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if I wanted my husband to do something to help, and even though we were both working the same number of hours, and doing things, I had to come in there specifically and say this needs to be done,
^q	this is what you do it now.
b	Yes,
sv	Most of the men don't walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes, you probably ought to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it.
sv(^q)	And I think most women walk in and, and with, got to clean all this up. Got to get this out and this in and this, you know, taken care of, instead of having someone say now, this needs to be do , this is the time this needs to be done,
sv(^q)	they're not going to, the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much this needs to be done, because mom was there saying that dad is there, you know,
sv	you both got to, they were both working at whatever things needed to be done.
sv(^q)	They're going to say to the kids you need do this, because it needs to be done not because it's a woman's job or a man's job, but because it's dirty and it needs to be clean.
sv	And it's going to, It's going to,
sv	the ones that are now getting to be teenagers and in some cases, young college.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and I felt like when they were young, that was the time to instill it. That it could be added to and strengthened as they grew older, but when they were little, you know,
sv	when you, if you, if you teach them when they're little the way you want them to be, and the things that are important to you, then you add onto it as they get older.
sv	But if no one does anything when they're little, then it's twice as hard I think, as they get older.
sd	I wait until I put mine in bed before I make my calls.
sv	like we said, if women's roles change drastically, men's roles will, too.
sv	but I think if we can expand the men's roles at the same time, like your taking care of your child, and your dad probably didn't very often
qy	Are you going to tell me what you've been doing lately in the
bk	okay.
ba	my.
sv	You, You are experienced I would say.
aa	Well, I agree.
sd	I have done something, like that, too, only not nearly as extensive.
sv	But it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch, style home.  after having a one that was historical looking.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
ad	Well, maybe you can, make that one charming and make a little bit money,
sd	Well, we just moved to Charlotte, from Enid, Oklahoma.
sd	So I know, of what you're talking about, as far as the market was concerned
sd	It was a cedar shake house, and very weathered.
sd	And, it was about fifty years old, but not really, traditional looking, particularly.
sd	I spent almost three years redoing.
sd	And I considered it a full time job
sd	we kind of had planned this, trek to the east, because we're both originally from this part of the country.
sd	For instance, one thing that I did that might even be a good suggestion for you was something I did on the outside.
sd	I love old estate sales.
sd	I happened to go to just a little estate sale just a little white frame house, where the couple, was very old, and had gone into nursing homes
sd	and all the men started going down to the barn.
^q	well shoot I'm going,
^q	I'm going to the barn, too.
sd	They, auctioned some tools and, things like that,
sd	but then they went over and started, auctioning this big stack of bricks.
sd(^q)	And, so, well, I thought, gee, I've been wanting to, do some brick, walkways for a time.
sd	Anyway, it ended up after some pretty, heavy bidding, that I got all those bricks for forty dollars.
sd	And, so my husband and I loaded bricks in his, pickup truck for days.
sd	But, what we ended up with was about four thousand.
na^m	For forty dollars.
sd	we had built a deck on the back of that house,
sd	and, it was quite large out to, into the yard
sd	but, on either side of it to the ends of the house it just needed to be all tied together.
sd	So we, made brick patios, and walkways.
sd	and he did the digging, which was about six inches,
sd	but I figured the sand and all, had that delivered and, leveled it and, placed most all the bricks.
sd	And it turned out beautifully.
sd	Well, it nearly killed me .
sd	I hated to leave it.
b	Uh huh.
nn	No
sd	I did get some material and studied every bit of material that I could study,
sd	but we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them,
sd	and we put them on a base of four inches of sand
sd	but but it was an error to leave like an eighth of an inch or whatever.
sd	You just put them together as close as you can.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I also used a rubber hammer, a lot, to, you know,
sd	if it wasn't quite level or something, I'd just get that, rubber hammer and, and prob , you know,
sd	if they have problems with, sand bugs of some kind I think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there on a fairly regular basis, for a while anyway.
sv	Well, I think, I think she needs to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are
^q	or what is it that will,
sd	Dursban or something like that.
sd	I think in this area or most all areas they use, you know, for ticks and fleas.
sv	And you know, they're, awful hard to do anything with.
sv	I bet Dursban would do it.
sv	I think, you probably just need to make sure that it dries, very, very well, before she lets her cats out, or something, like that.
qy^g	Well, gosh, Deb, we could talk all day couldn't we .
b	Yes.
ba	Wow.
b	Oh.
ba	good.
b	Yes.
sd	so I'm just starting out.
sv	that's quite a spread .
sd	so they couldn't do a whole lot, yet.
sd	They like to be outside as much as possible.
sd	but, you know, the weather's trying to turn now
sd^e	I I'm, I'm in, Dallas.
na^r	right.
b	Right.
sd	one of the trends I've, I've noticed is that, it's always too easy to just plop your kids down in front of the T V and let them watch movies or play video games or something.
aa	Sure.
aa	Sure.
bd	That's okay.
sd	And one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible. Although it really is very easy to do that type of thing. Just plop them down in front of the T V and let them be, entertained that way.
qw	And, seeing as you've got some older children, I'm wondering, how did you handle that, when they were growing up?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Right .
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ba	that's nice.
sd	And I think we probably will soon as the boys get a little bit older.
sd	because they like just being outside.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	you don't see many leaves around Dallas.
b	Uh huh.
sd^t	one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from? Or sources.
aa	That's what, I would think.
sd	They found people are getting sick,
sd	and the only thing I can think of would be cars and factories.
aa	Yeah.
qy^g	well that's destroying the ozone, isn't it?
sv	It's kind of scary.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think something too that you probably see in older states, all we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces.
sv	I think it will.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	In this area too since, you know, in Texas we're so spread out,
sd	and we don't even have any mountains that are, holding it in.
sd	But they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together, the worse it gets.
sd	You don't have to have mountains that are stopping it.
sd	and we didn't see this a few years ago.
sd	It was pretty clear here.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	So do you have any recycling programs there?
b	Uh huh.
sd	We've progressed a little bit farther than that.
sd	and, they will have these green bins
sd	and it's just as standard as a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump.
sd	You know, anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin.
sd	and a lot of the restaurants they just have, places especially beer places, where you can throw away green bottles, and then the brown bottles.
sd	I guess they're, you know, clear bottles.
sd	And, of course, they have the, dumpsters, the igloos.
sd	and they have those strategically placed around the city.
sd	And, they're actually going to extend it, I think, one of these days maybe to apartment complexes
sv	So, I guess when you live in a bigger city it really becomes, necessary.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
sd	I remember my grandparents and I used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans.
sd	And, of course, there you know you have a specific place to put your paper.
sd	and I think it started out to be, just kind of a test, a pilot project.
sd	But, they just go around to each, door and pick it up.
b	Yeah.
sd	and every year, of course, the phone books they tell everybody across the city to, put all their phone books in, the, recycle bins.
sd	well, for a bigger city they're pretty thick.
sd	And sometimes you might have two or three.
sv	So, that's a big savings right there in itself.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	recycled paper is actually very expensive.
sd	it's really a cost.
sd	But I know, for a fact that the paper, on that end they're not, you know.
sd	but it's, not to their advantage.
sd^t	I can't think of anything else.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I hope you all, come along a little farther in the future.
fc	It was nice talking to you.
fc	Bye bye.
qy	Are you there?
ad	now tell me your favorite team.
ny	Yes.
ad	so we'll have to talk about the future with the Rangers.
qo	What are your thinkings on what they can do, what they'll be able to do?
nd	Well, I heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down. on his,
b	uh huh.
sv	they're the ones that probably are paying the highest.
sv	And I think this is absolutely ridiculous.
o	No.
aa	That's right.
sd	Buechele was back just to visit.
sd	I'm awful sorry he's not still.
aa	I'm sure it was.
b	Yeah.
qo	Well, what do you think of Howse, who is the coach for the pitchers?
aa	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I really wish they could see fit to get rid of Howse.
sd	and I'm not fond of Grieves.
aa	Yeah.
sd	Well, I'm just gullible enough that I think Bobby Valentine is, doing all right
nd	Well ,
sd	but I would like so much for these Rangers to get their act together and give, Nolan Ryan the support he needs.
aa	I understand.
qy	So have you done any painting projects lately?
bh	really?
qw	What kind of painting was it?
bh	was it?
b	Yeah,
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	well, what kind of paint did you use for the, bookends?
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	So you can't use oil on wood?
bf	so you had to go around with paint all over you, temporarily, anyway.
qy	is that what you usually use in the house, is latex?
sd	and one of the real strict, restrictions, was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff
sd	so, she had that done.
na@	Well, so to speak, I had to paint the inside of this warehouse thing * I would have put a slash after the answer "so to speak" that you keep some, farm equipment in
sd	I mean you know, it looked just like, it was the viscosity of paint thinner
sd	and, if you saw that the wood was getting wet, you know, that was all you needed.
sd	It was pretty easy, actually.
qy	Did you have to do that?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah,
qr	Did you have, one coat or two?
b	Uh huh.
sv	that would be really a time saver.
b	Uh huh.
sd	it would have taken me forever.
sd	well, the first time it'd probably would have taken me forever,
qw	Well, how long did it take you all?
qy^d	So there was two of you all?
sv	Well, that's easy enough.
sd	I think I could probably do it as long as the hardware store told me what to buy, then I could do it.
qy^g	Well, I don't have strong feelings about changes to be made in the, jury system, do you?
sv	well then you must know a lot more about this than I do .
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	I thought that was the point of, a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt.
sv	But, if there are some people who don't agree it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people.
qy	Have you served on a jury?
sd	They say they're, remarkably incompetent. And, don't know what they're doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out to air, and all that.
sd	, they don't want anyone with exper , anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system.
sd	let's say I were arrested falsely or not and put up for a jury I wouldn't feel that, I would be being tried by a jury of my peers.
h	and, I don't know,
sd	I get a little bit nervous about it,
sd	so I'm pretty sure I didn't.
sv	because, you know, there's the classic sort of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD kind of story where you get, you know, jury which can have all kinds of prejudices and things that, a judge at least officially isn't supposed to have. Though, of course they can, too. / * This last sentence really appears to be an independent slash unit
sv	And, it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much you know, browbeat the jury, of the, a majority of the jury,
^q	and, let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff.
sd(^q)	let's make them pay as much as possible. Things like that.
sd	but I'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be, things like that.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I guess the judge's time is worth too much, though.
sv	they pay those jury members very little money compared to that judge .
sv	He makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	They want to find a juror that's going to, be most persuadable by their arguments, you know.
^q	I'm too busy to serve on a jury,
sd	and they or just, you know, just answer one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that, you know,
sd(^q)	they just say do you believe in such and such.
sv	Course, they would be barred,
b	Uh huh.
sv	well it sounds like we both need to get out there and serve on a jury.
sd	I hope we're called up before too long.
fc	well it was nice talking with you.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	so I can assume that you probably watch the T V news.
ba	Wow.
qw	what station do you listen to?
qy^d	Not it's not a network station.
sd	They're getting a little feisty now .
qy^d	so you have a paper or something or,
b	Uh huh.
sd	fact, last time I read the Dallas news I was in Arkansas.
bh	yeah?
qw	So, how did that happen, anyway?
qw	I mean, when did they ,
aa	Yeah.
b	really.
sd	There's, quite a task if you've ever run into one.
sd	and then the HERALD EXAMINER collapsed about two years ago because of, I don't know, just nobody was buying it really.
sd	but, you know, it's not the TIMES.
sd	I don't have time.
sv	There's a lot of people who fall into that, category.
sv	It's basically anything that's south of downtown, they don't bother to cover.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I mean, I mean, the way they've been handling it before, they practically acted like their reporters needed to shots to go south of the L A county border .
^q	but you're not bothering to cover the things that are interesting to us.
b	Okay .
sd^e	I did.
sd	I went to a small liberal arts college in Virginia.
sd	but my parents were retiring in South Carolina when I graduated and, were looking for a southern school and, also U of M seemed overwhelming in size
qo	and, what about you?
bf	so you're from the Midwest, too.
qw	Where are you?
sd	we're in Plano.
sd	I really like it .
bf	And your daughter is going to be a sophomore.
qy	because you live in Austin, is she thinking about the University of Texas?
b	Oh.
b	Yes.
sd	when I say small, my graduating class had eighteen in it.
sd	And so they suggested that I might want a smaller school because I was used to a lot of one on one or small group situations.
sd	and I also wanted to spend one year studying in Europe.
sd	I had had an A F S student from Germany live with us our senior year
sd	but because I had had a fair amount of French going in I was able to do my year's study in France and able to take a lot of the other courses that interested me.
sd	and so that was some of,
sd	and I don't think that,
sd	and really his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand.
sd	and so he's used to a bigger size
sd	and they really felt, like they were numbers.
b	Yeah.
sd	And even though Baylor,
sd	even this year, Jay had an aptitude test,
qy	Does your daughter know what she'd like to do?
b	Yeah.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes.
sd^t	invasions of privacy.
sd	what most annoys me are all sorts of phone calls trying to sell me things.
sd	All, sorts of hours calling and telling me that I want investment advise and I want this service and that service or the other thing.
sd	something about the random dialers that just dial phone numbers.
sd	I guess in some cases they just consider pickup your phone and, and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not.
sd	and, businesses would be prohibited, from calling for, for business selling you things.
aa	I'm sure that's true.
qy	is that right?
sd	And, especially with possibly children around.
sv	that could be useful protection.
sd	So, I used to deal with,
qw	What are dialing services?
bf	where people just call you.
sd	those problems used to be when I used a credit card they'd want to have my phone number.
sd	I gave out my work number
sd	otherwise I think the practice has basically been eliminated asking for a phone number.
qw	How did Radio Shack work?
qy^d	but you, you nonetheless often get people calling you?
qy^d	Despite the fact that your number is unlisted?
qrr	or are they just calling a number that happens to be yours?
b	Uh huh.
bf	and they have a whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers.
qy	is there anything you can do about that like give out a phony phone number?
sv	I think it's gotten much worse the last, few years.
sd	Maybe that's just because I've gotten on more lists.
o^t	Your turn.
sd	We just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which I guess is a comfortable thing.
sd	It just sort of happens automatically.
sd	and, the cost of living here in California is, I would say rather pathological .
sd	housing prices are, you know, like from four to ten times more expensive than, they were where I came from in, Dallas.
sd	So, that presents a real shock .
sd	ac , actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to California
sv	It's God's country.
sd	When I, was in, undergraduate school a long, long time ago, I, noted that the starting average monthly salary salary for engineers you know, in my discipline, was like six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that.
sd	So I stopped worrying about money.
sd	never have worried about money since then.
sd	But, I suppose I've lost money on not taking good advantage of, investments
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I guess we're both lucky in that regard then.
qw	How big is your family?
bk	I see.
sv	whe , once you get ten children though, you may have,
bk	all right .
sd	and they are beginning to be a budget problem but, have not been really up to this point.
sd	and I give him the other half in cold cash.
sd	But, at least, it isn't, you know, burning a hole in his pocket.
sd^t	we're supposed to talk about vacations.
sd	Her grandmother lives there
sd	so I'm praying I get to go.
sd	it will be probably the most exciting place I'll ever get to go.
qy	Have you ever been to, like New Mexico?
b	Oh.
sd	I was just wondering what it was like.
br	Tahiti?
b	oh.
b^m	Haiti.
qw	Where is that?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	So, what did you do when you were in Europe?
b	Uh huh.
qw	What did you do on the farm?
qy	Are you just kind of sight, just kind of,
sd	Paris.
b	Yeah.
sd	but we're only going to stay two weeks.
sd	so that might be fun.
sd	French cooking.
b	Yeah.
sd	go to museums and,
qy	Do you go to museums in Europe?
ba	that's neat.
qy	have you ever been to Hawaii?
bh	No?
nn	No.
sd	I'm wanting to go there.
qh	where have I gone that's anywhere.
qy^g	That shouldn't be too much trouble for the two of us. Right?
b	Right.
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	That's really sad isn't it? .
sd	Well just recently in the paper here, were articles about students, working. High school students that work and the percentage of hours that they work and how that affects their grades.
sd	but for those students who are determined to do well anyway, that, you know, handling a job was very possible. You know, and that it seemed to have more to do with other factors.
sd	And what's their home situation.
b	Right.
sv	But there can still be an attitude of
sv	but the most important thing is still, you know getting your education.
sd	It's what's wrong with families .
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	And that's just really not enough.
sd	But, you know, part of my feeling is that if you help them to work through their problems while they're littler, then they won't have as many problems up there.
b	Really.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Right.
aa	it certainly is.
aa	That's right .
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	I'm on that, campus strategic planning committee for my school.
sd	Then I think they decided to strike economic.
qh	You know will then people go to private schools?
qh	and what kind of state are we in if most people are going to private schools.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	That's right.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
h	I believe it's something like that,
h	And, I don't know .
b	Right.
sv	That's so important,
sd	Well that new movie, That new movie out,
sv	really, really a frightening situation.
qy^t	So, well, shall we wrap it up?
aa^t	I think we have to.
fc	So I'll see you when we see you.
sd	and we went to hear, James wind ensemble concert
sd	they left this morning for, England.
qy	Isn't that wonderful?
b	Uh huh.
o	For N I S T, the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
ad^t	Let me push the button.
sv	but, I sense that it's not going to happen anytime soon.
b	Uh huh.
br	You're now in what?
b^m	Acoustics,
sv	I suppose some things well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that's happening, having a new generation come up that's more used to it.
bf	They have to for international trade.
sv	But, I guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, be , because of, of computers coming into everything.
sv	Everyone wants a conversion of that before kind of recognizing it as, as, as, as a concept to hold in mind.
sv	I mean we're not the kind of society that, that something can be posed upon, by government will.
sv	the, the public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems, money, dollar, coins, anything like that.
sv	and, and , it obviously makes no sense that we're practically alone in the world in using the old system.
sv	Well, I mean, unfortunate , I think people like you are relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day.
sd(^q)	we have signs up on the N I S T campus here, speed limit twenty five miles per hour, forty kilometers per hour.
sd	but that hasn't been adopted very widely.
sv	I mean, and no one will go a step further to remove the english signs.
sv	or, you have highway signs saying speed limit, eighty, eighty five, whatever would be the appropriate number.
sv	you suddenly have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now.
qy	do the schools emphasize the metric system?
sd	I, I meant, I meant down, like, in the elementary schools.
sd	but it doesn't get emphasized over the other.
sd	So they actually have about three passes at this collection. One for the regular trash, one for the, you know, the bottles and cans and one for the newspapers.
sd	they do that on the truck.
sv	Of course, you being from New Mexico, you've probably been to Washington. Especially if you're, your present location.
qy^d	You must have come to Washington at least once.
sv	I mean there's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could use for landfill. .
sd@	other than nuking it. / *" of A.16 since it's not a clause or an answer to a question.
sv	I don't think anybody around here would understand all the, all those exotic techniques, you know, getting rid of the heavy metals.
sv	I think I think would get very, you know, they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
o	Well, credit cards .
sd	I'll tell you what, I can't say a whole lot about credit cards because I, tore mine up.
sd	I have a, gas card that I use just for gas and you know, one that I use just for emergencies
aa	I know it.
b	Uh huh.
bh	is that right?
sv	that's a good policy.
sd	but in most cases, I'm glad I don't because you know, unfortunately I, I, I don't have the control you have .
sd	but but I don't.
sd	I just don't want to get into that situation again,
sd	even with my gas card you know, I find that I'll go in to get some gas
sd	and I'll end up buying, you know, candy and drinks and you know, sweets and whatever,
sd(^q)	and I'm thinking what did I get, that costs so much.
sd	but I can certainly understand where ,
qw	How, how old are you?
b^m	Thirty three?
qy^d	You'll be thirty three this year?
sd	It's coming.
sd	I know what you mean about the interest rates. it's unbelievable.
b	Uh huh.
ba	jeez.
sd	in fact, I've, I've even, heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less, rates and have paid off their, you know higher interest rate, cards and just sent them back, you know.
sd(^q)	if you've got a pretty good credit rating you can call you know, your, your card, wherever you got your card from and tell them, hey, either drop my rates or drop my, you know, annual fees or I'll just go to somewhere else.
sd	You know, and if you've got a pretty good history with them they're more than willing to do that.
sd	and he says you know, he's tried it with several of his cards
^q	and yours is at, you know, eighteen or nineteen percent.
^q	and I'll go somewhere else and get it.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Well, what would you have at a dinner party?
b	Uh huh.
ba	gosh, that sounds great.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or a informal dinner party.
sd	But if it was informal, my first choice would be crawfish.
sd	but you know, I wouldn't have to worry about satisfying my guest.
sd	shrimp fettucini is real easy to, make and everything
sd	so, I think on the lines of,
ar	I mean, well, you eat them dead
sd	you can always tell whenever they're cooked if they've been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out.
sd	And you're not supposed to eat those because they're bad for you.
sd	but if the tail is straight on it then, yeah, don't eat it.
sd	But, you just put some Cajun, well, lots of pepper
sv	but, you know, if you have nails or anything you can plan on those being shot.
sd	it depends.
sd	Like like my age, if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party, no, they would shell their own,
sd	But there's a, There's a, big thing over here that everybody sucks the head.
sd	And usually you use those like for frying or to put in salads or to You know make a sauce with or something like that
sd	and they're more expensive of course
sd^e@	it really does * Looks like a slash unit to me I like shrimp better / * These seems to be independent of A.55 utt 2 above, not a continuation
sd	It also depends on who's cooking it and how much seasoning they use stuff like that
sv	And also to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party I think that that really helps
sd	That's what I need
b	Uh huh
ba	Oh!
bf	that got pretty competitive you know as far as who could come up with the best recipe
sv	That would be fun
b	huh
bf	and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something
ba	Well you know that's fun
sv	That sounds right I would I'd take him up on that
b	Uh huh
sd	I'm doing a lot more cooking now than I used to
sd	but I usually try to stay out of kitchen
sd	not one of my favorite hobbies
sd	and they are absolutely delicious
sd	I would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around
b	Oh
b	Yeah
ba	that would be wonderful
b	Yeah
b	Oh
b	Um hum
qw	Well how long do you cook the meatballs
b	Uh huh
b	yeah
sd	Especially I mean the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so far in advance
bf	I mean like if you are having a dinner party on Wednesday night you could do it on a weekend
sd	He's going to be working for Chevron in Houston
sv	You know I'm sure that dinner parties will come in handy
sd	I have to impress the boss and clients cause I'm in public relations in school
sd	so I'm going to have lots of dinner parties
sd	and all the little bitty things that I didn't even know
qy^t	So Is there anything else
sv	they're wonderful.
qy	did you watch the Bulls this morning?
sd	They won by they won by two points.
sd	and Isaiah missed a three point attempt, at the end
sd	and, I think the Bulls won by two.
na	I think they do, as a matter of fact.
sd	One of the, commentators said that they expected that the Bulls would, if they continued at their current pace, set an N B A record for seventy wins in a season.
sd	they looked real good
sd@	and I think they look like, they'll repeat, although, here in the Bay Area people are real impressed with what Don Nelson's done with the Warriors. / * Should "although" start a new slash unit?
sd	and they were impressive.
sv	that was a good move for the Warriors to trade for him.
sv	and and, they made a heck of a threesome
sd	and they traded either Richmond or Hardaway to Sacramento for Billy Owens
h	and I don't know,
qy	is it Boston in, first place?
sd	They said they've lost a lot of squeakers.
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you, for example, like San Antonio in Dallas?
bf	So there isn't much crossover,
b	Yeah.
qy^g	because San Antonio isn't that close to you, are they?
aa	No.
bf	so it's not something you'd drive,
sd	I was thinking maybe David Robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing.
sv	I mean, of course, drafting a franchise like him certainly,
sd	you know Magic was a franchise for the Lakers and, you know, Bird for the, Celtics
b	Well, yeah.
sv	And I think I think Jordan and the Bulls have to be, considered the likely favorites.
sv	They were so disap ,
o	All right.
sd	 I had a job I had to go get a blood test for.
sd	They just don't tell you they did.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I guess it depends on if you got something to worry about .
nd	Well, I, I come from kind of a biased opinion because I'm a therapist and a drug and alcohol counselor.
sd	and I know the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents, on the job that are specifically drug and alcohol related,
sd	and the only way that they can prevent that is, you know, making sure that the employees are drug and alcohol free.
sv	and, nobody knows about it,
sd	but you know, ends up costing the company lots and lots of money.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	True.
b	Yeah.
sv	it's, I think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job if somebody else is impaired.
sv	you find out one way or another if somebody's got a problem on the job.
sv	if her work or abilities start affecting her co workers then it's still a problem.
sv	I guess it comes with the turf.
sd	So you're, you're breaking the law anyway.
sv	Probably the biggest problem with those is they don't do a real good job of assessing for alcohol.
sv	And that's probably the biggest problem there is .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	If you do test positive for something they will give you an o , opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose you're job. / * you're > your
sv	I think the company benefits in the long run.
qw	what kind of testing do they do when you went?
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, that happens.
sd	It happens a lot.
sd	there are people that pay other people to , to help them out.
b	Yeah.
sd	They've got different degrees, as far as how far back they can check.
sd	They've some companies that are doing, hair tests.
sd	and they can apparently test, back a certain period of time. Because some of the residue ends up in your hair follicles, you know,
sd	Hair follicles, I guess, are just dead protein
sd	They can go back and look at, in terms of growth in a hair, when you used and that type of thing.
sv	So, I guess if they perfect that is not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give blood or something like that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
fc	Well, I did, too.
fc	Uh huh.
sd	and, so, I thought that if I had a good hunting dog like Thumper that, I could just go out and get all kinds of game .
sd^e	except we live in Plano, Texas now
qy	Do you have a pet now?
qw	What kind of cat is it?
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Being born outside, you didn't have any problems house training him?
ba	That's good.
^2	And older .
sd	and we sort of fell in love with the, Maine Coon cats.
sd	They're huge.
b	Oh.
sd	I didn't know that.
ba	Well that's interesting.
sd	but the Manx, is that the one that doesn't have a tail
sd	I kind of like that, too,
sv^t	and then I suppose our five minutes will be up.
^q	I, I can just hear the dog crying for me now .
o	All right.
aa	Okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, right now we're we're having the little bit of Spring that we have.
sd	It goes from Winter to Summer, usually.
sd	we had one of those blow through tonight.
sd	And I think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days.
sd	It's gotten up to, ninety a couple of times.
sd	But, basically, it's been in the low seventies and eighties.
sd	It's not really been too bad.
sd	Usually it sneaks on into the nineties a little earlier.
sd^e	quite a bit.
sd	in fact we drove down to Corpus last week
sd	and, there were still some paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way.
sd	and they had a big rainstorm come through there, part of the same thing we're getting now, I guess.
sd	That's the second or third year in a row that we've had a real rainy Spring.
sd	We had a pretty rainy Fall last year, as well.
sd	we've had a few down here, but not anything like Kansas.
sd	But this is the season for that.
sd	they do pop up occasionally, around here.
b	Yeah.
sd	so when it's July and August, I'm pretty well used to the, hundred degree temperatures.
sd	It's that black clay soil.
sd	so it doesn't absorb the water real well.
sd	You know, once it rains a little bit, it's filled up and everything else just runs off,
o	you know.
b	Yeah.
sd	And there's a section in South Dallas that's had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain.
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I guess I'd prefer that .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	it's nothing like Houston.
sd	or East Texas, is a little more humid.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bf	Probably the Pacific breezes make a lot of difference,
ba	That's nice.
sd	and that was a real change for me.
sd	And, they have, of course, some pretty severe storms, Winter storms, snow and that type of thing.
sd	But they're so good about clearing the roads, that, you know, it doesn't usually bother you very much.
sd	It never gets real, real hot.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and there's a flash flood watch and, more rain for the next three or four days.
sd	Maybe we can send you some .
fc	Well, I enjoyed talking with you Lisa,
fc	You, too.
fc	Bye.
qo^t	Well, how did you like that topic?
sd	I don't.
sv	I just don't think there's a place in our environment, you know in the work force for drugs, or alcohol either.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	You did?
sd	but not being a teacher, as you are, you know, I was not quite as sympathetic you know, as I probably would have been if Kay were a teacher or something.
aa	That's right.
sd	and I think it is a big problem with them using drugs from what you read, you know,
sd	And I think most of them have agreed to that now, although they didn't like it at first.
sd@	that is belittling, you know, I'd probably feel the same way if I had to do that. / * Parsing error? Shouldn't this be 2 slash units, with the 2nd starting at "I'd probably . . ."?
aa	that's true,
sv	gosh, they would really raise a stink if that was to happen.
sv	it's just our bleeding heart liberals that would fight it tooth and nail, you know
qy^g^t	I don't know how long we're supposed to carry on a conversation, do you?
ad^t	well, we'd better keep talking because I've not heard it have we.
qy^t	Have you heard it?
qy^g	Anyway, we both sort of agree on it, don't we about random testing.
h	Well, listen,
b^r	yeah.
sd	If you agree that,
b	Yeah.
bh	Is that right?
sd	when I think of drug testing, I'm thinking of the, you know, outside of education.
sv	but, you don't think of that first hand, normally.
bh	Isn't that, isn't that mind boggling,
sd	I know teachers are just like everybody else, same problems the same, good qualities as anybody else.
b^r	yeah.
qy^d	you think the benefit would be greater than the,
qy^d	And that was in your children's high school,
bh	Isn't that amazing,
sv	if it's if it was true there, I'm sure it's true with just about probably to some degree every school there is
sv	you know, because they represent a pretty good,
fp	I'm in Plano, Texas.
sv	Not too far away.
sd^t	I've had some from Plano, too.
^h	let's see.
b^m^t	Social changes.
sd^t	That sounds like not as recent social changes, too, like back to the sixties or fifties, I guess .
qy^t	Think we can handle that?
qy^t	shall I go ahead and push one?
qy^t	You want to go ahead and start? .
b	Oh .
sv	That involves a lot of different areas, I think.
sv	perhaps there's less of the middle range then there was.
sv	Because of the way children are being raised, they're not learning the values they need to learn.
sv	And, I think we're seeing a lot of rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang things that are happening
b	Yeah.
sv	and they think they have to
sv	And, I think that if they didn't and it became more of the standard not to that, I don't know maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home. {D You know? } And have a more solid, foundation for the kids.
sv	trying to do all these programs like Headstart and things like those. You wouldn't have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them, you know.
sv	They don't want to stay home with the kids or something like that.
sv	There are a lot of two parent, situations where the woman goes back to work because that's what she wants to do, you know.
sv	so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself, too . You know,
sd	Home school.
aa	Yeah.
sd	, I have, one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler. And one on the way .
sv	and a lot of it is discipline problems.
sv	it's really obvious to look at them and watch the way they act and things. That, they've been raised in a day care center.
sv	Well, I think it's going to, change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else.
sv	and maybe part of that is educating parents better.
o	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It was unusual not to have the different sources, you know, of news coverage.
qh	I mean, what's the other one, C B S.
sd	They all were tapped into C N N.
nn	Uh uh.
sd	and like you I listened to radio on my job at work.
sd	well, I listen to a Christian radio station.
sd	we had some people from our church went to Israel, just for a, tour sort of thing.
sd@	so we got all fearful for our people, come to find out they came back and said they weren't even aware of it, / * Shouldn't a slash follow "our people", making this 2 separate utterances?
sd	and so it really made me question as to how do we know, you know, if the news we're getting is any good.
aa^r	right.
b	Yeah.
sd	it just really gets me depressed, even to watch it.
sv	you don't even know about it.
sd	but I don't read newspapers .
nn	Huh uh.
sd	And I live in kind of a bad area where if I have the paper delivered it's stolen before I can get out and get it .
sd	They just come by and pick them up even if it's just for the TV, you know selections of the day.
sd	It just wouldn't be there whenever I tried it.
sd	But, they do.
qw	What part of California are you from?
bk	okay.
qy^d	you work for T I?
b	Yeah.
qy^d^t	This is your first call?
b	really.
sd^t	and they interrupt at ten, minutes.
ad^t	So if we've done our three minutes. Let's just let the conversation end and say bye.
fc	Nice talking to you too.
qrr	or current,
aa	That's true.
sd	and just as that boat took off, a turtle bit me in the middle of the back.
sd	I haven't managed to get a hold on that, craft yet,
sd	but, just from what I've seen, you just kind of work your way up to it and turn around real quick , you know. Grab the rope behind you and then just let go real quick and let it whip you around.
sd	maybe someday , I'll get back to that after the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end, weekend or something.
sd^t	I guess we're supposed to talk about what's being done about recycling.
qy^g	Well, lots, right?
o	Finally.
sd	Well, we have saved our newspapers for years and years because the, Boy Scouts our boys have been involved in have, had a huge recycling bin, over at Resurrection Lutheran Church
sd	like it's about a fifth of what it used to be
sd	so the Boy Scout troop quit doing it when the City took it over.
qy	Do you live in Plano?
b	yeah.
b	Right.
ny	Yes.
sd	Although just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that, work in the library for me said they hadn't gotten theirs.
b	Yeah.
b^r	yeah.
sd	we used to take ours there.
aa	I know.
sd	I do news, mostly newspapers and, plastic two liter diet Coke bottles . And aluminum cans some,
sd	but I don't use as many of those.
sv	I guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that are really dirty that you have to wash out .
ba	ha.
bf	Wasting all your time and effort and, Putting it in there.
b^r	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	because let's see, they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight.
sd	So if you recycle things, of course, then you don't have all that weight in there.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
aa	right.
sv	Probably going to throw them in your trash .
sd	but I wonder if they would take,
sd	kind of a pain to, you know, drive over somewhere special for two little tiny batteries
aa	that's true.
sd	when I was home those few days around Thanksgiving and the truck came by, well, we all ran out to watch it because, you know, we'd never really seen it pick up our stuff
sd	and one thing I thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he, scanned across the little bar code on our bin as soon as he took the stuff
sd	so I don't know what that was reading it for
sd	they must be trying to keep track of , you know, who is doing it, or what, I guess.
h	I don't know.
bf	for those who are really cooperating.
sv	Now, that would encourage it.
sd	now there is just one garbage man that comes on the truck instead of two.
sd	also, slightly off the subject, but our big green garbage thing got stolen.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	And they said that between three and four hundred have been stolen.
qy	Isn't that sad? You know.
sv	and they must be, Yeah, really expensive.
sd	I mean, of course, we were hoping we weren't going to have to pay for it, you know
qw	What sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, actually I work for the F B I.
sd	I'm an engineer. You know.
sd	and all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do. Which I thought was kind of interesting and, But, but that sort of thing.
sv	But, I think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on.
sv	In the private sector I would think that one of the major, situations, especially when you reach, you know, the mid fifties, is keeping a job until you retire.
sv	But as you climb up that tree, pretty soon the branches get smaller on the top of the tree
sd	and, you know, I can get up,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
o	Okay.
sd	mostly between the ages of two and ten.
sd	and, I mean, they became like my children .
sv	Children are so full of energy.
sv	And, they just, the , they just keep you going .
sd	one parent.
aa	Yeah.
sd	And she would get home at like five thirty in the afternoon.
sd	and then it was time for them to go to bed.
sd	and he's like a little brother to me.
sd	we get along a lot better now that he's older.
sd	but I feel like, I don't know, when I have children I want to be able to spend a lot of time with them.
sd^e	I go to L S U.
sd	communications.
sd^e	I mean, I love children.
sd	I think it was very beneficial to us.
sd	and when I was younger I thought they were lucky because they got to get away with things, like I couldn't ride my bike across the street, but they could because they're Mom would never know it.
sd	But now I realize that it was better because, they have got into a lot of trouble, because of lack of supervision.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I'm majoring in, public relations.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I would like to, stay at home with my children for at least the first five years.
sd	But what I plan to do in the future is, go ahead and get my upper education as far as my masters, and work on my doctorate and teach, college,
sd	but I'd like to stay at home with them until they get at least into kindergarten, where they're at school from what, eight to three or something
sd	and then I would be at my school, teaching.
bh	really?
qw	What grade?
qw	What did you teach?
sd	I started out as a P E major, in education.
sd	I sure did.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Absolutely.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
bf	They need some attention.
sv	it's hard to make it on one income,
sd	we only had one telephone, you know,
sd	but I feel like that it helped me now because I appreciate the value of the dollar,
sd	and I hope that I can provide that for my child too.
aa	we have.
b	Uh huh.
bf	It's way too late,
aa	I agree.
sv	It is. Because all the peer pressure, it starts in high school
bf	and the parent really needs to be there for the child.
ba	great.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I guess that was good that you were hearing it from other students.
qy	Does your son work for T I?
b	Oh.
ba	goodness.
qw	what do you think is the biggest problem?
b	Uh huh.
qr	do you think it's the values that they're teaching in school or the values they get from home.
sv	and, I think that that part of that showing up now, you know, with things because kids I think have probably less respect for people in other things, than we may have seen in the past,
sv	and I think that's, that's another root problem.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	but, you know, some that are they're, they're not quite the same as the kids that are going to the inner city, you know, public schools.
b	Yeah.
sv	and, maybe they pick up on that.
sv	they may be able to give the resources that's needed to do a good job.
sd	that's a tough question how to fix the school system.
sv	if you don't care about property and people, you know, you're not going to care about learning, I think. You know,
sv	you're not going to really care about yourself.
b	Right.
sv(^q)	it's kind of hard to say, well, you need to take care of other people's stuff as well, when you barely have anything yourself.
sd	AIDS has more money than, breast cancer .
sd	And yet we've had breast cancer problems for years.
sd	And, having thought about that for a while,
sd	And yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years.
sd	I guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to. be it through different organizations, March of Dimes type, telethons or bicycle rides or whatever, how they fund whatever, illness they wish.
^q	so give it a tenth of that and just keep doling it out that way
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	But, we have such an affluent , society that I wonder if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a cure for just about everything.
sv	Of course, then we wouldn't have any room to put people,
qh	but are they that enhancing for the masses, you know.
qy	and do you have a family?
qy	and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances.
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see. ,
sd	and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest
sd	I work part time at night
sd	and so } that does help,
sd	so it's pretty well ear marked.
aa	Yeah .
sd	and divide those up between all,
sd	and then the next pay check we're real short
aa	That's true.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, it helps you to focus where your money goes
sv(^q)	and then you're saying, my word where did all that money go.
^q	Where does it go?
sd	and we wrote down everything that we bought you know, every pay check
sd	we should cause it does help.
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
qy	have you developed a savings plan or I R A s or anything like that yet?
b	Uh huh.
sv	That's a good feeling .
sd	My husband just graduated from the university, a year ago
sd	so finally finally we are getting to that point too.
qy	So, are you still going to school
fp	Hello.
fp	Hey, how you doing?
fp	Fernando.
co	Let me turn off my stereo here .
sd^t	Because I've been, like, waiting, like, for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody.
ny	Yeah.
qy	are you in Dallas?
bh	Are you?
sd^t	Because every time I got through, I went to Dallas, Texas.
sd^e	I'm in North Carolina.
^2	On the other coast .
sd	I'm watching SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE here.
qw^t	what did, how did you get to know about the T I thing?
qw	what are you working on ?
sd	I'm doing my Masters in computer science and computer engineering.
sd	At North Carolina State University.
sd	and I'm in Raleigh
sd	all you have is like towns built around universities.
qy^d	Like Chapel Hill?
qw	Where you at?
sd	and that's about it.
aa	Yeah.
bk	okay.
qy	Do you go to Berkeley?
sd	Because, I was looking at the, doctorate degree in computer science center at Berkeley .
sd	And they're asking like for a, G P A of like three point seven or something like that.
sd	And like they're looking like for, G R E like ninety nine percentile and this and that.
sd	I mean, it was like for me, it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and, ninety nine percentile on the verbal part.
b	Yeah.
qy	So, are you going to go for your Doctorate?
b	Yeah.
qw	When do you get out?
bk	okay .
qo	but what if they pay for it?
qo^r	What if they pay for?
ny	Yeah.
sd	Because I know a couple of people here that work for, the Army.
sd	But, {E I mean, } the guy is still in.
sd	And, he works over in Maryland .
sd	They gave him like a scholarship like for a year.
sd	And he's doing it in like, in a year and a summer.
sd	and, they said like they got a lot of benefits and that.
sd	That's why you want to join.
sd(^q)	I go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money, once you've get your, your Masters.
sd(^q)	They go, well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it
b	Yeah.
sd	once you get your Masters, you can be earning anywhere between like thirty seven, forty five thousand a year.
sd	And and that's not what they're paying.
sd	I know .
b	Yeah.
sd	In I B M, you can get certain points
sd	But nobody can get one more point to become, you know, like whatever you need to earn so much money.
sd	all the major companies get into a boating race, right?
sd(^q)	And so, I B M says well we have to have a team, right.
sd	and they have this whole team, you know, analyze why they came in last right. Because the person asked for it.
sd	but, you know, it's like like one person does the work
aa	Yeah.
sd	I mean, everyone's a manager
sd	I mean, it's like the people that actually do the work there are, very few.
qy	it's like have you, have have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express with, the think tank? You know,
sd	and they can tell you where your package is anywhere, any time.
sd	But, see, the thing is, that I B M is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff.
b	Yeah.
^2	and you're dead.
sd	Because what they do is they put you in a different job. Which you actually are like sitting around not doing anything.
sd	They never fire anybody unless you're caught doing something illegally.
sd	like if you're stealing something or doing anything like that .
sd	So they'll put you into keeping up the paper, you know.
sd(^q)	And then you say that's not my job,
sd	so you quit.
aa	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	It's like they won't say,
sd	And anybody can fix it.
sv	And so that's what you're going to go for.
qy	Have you ever heard of Leading Edge?
br	What?
sd	they made like, small personal computers.
sd	But what they did, I don't know, is buy all the parts that I B M would throw away. And build an I B M P C with all the parts that I B M would throw away.
sd(^q)	Leading Edge will say we'll buy it from you.
sd	I mean, they're still around I think.
sd	and that's why they're so compatible. Because I mean
sv	and by the time you have computer for five years, you're going to throw it away anyway. You know.
sd	it's like, voice, synthesizing stuff.
^q	And then when you tried to erase and correct, you know, all the errors in your voice, it takes up all your memory.
^q	I mean you put into Wave
sd*	imagine what it is for us to make mark off models, you know.
sd(^q)	It's like, Jesus Christ.
b^r	Yeah.
sv	It's like once you have something,
sd	In nineteen seventy six NASA came up with Three D graphics.
sd	And they were showing this like Three D graphics view of like,
nn^r	no.
sd	this is like video game stuff.
^g	Okay?
qw	Well what kind of car, are you thinking of buying next?
qy^g	You like the Chrysler products, do you?
bh	Do you really?
qw	What year is it?
qw	And why don't you like the Mustang?
ba	I'll be darned.
aa	There you go.
sd	She real , She likes those.
qw	Well, what things do you consider when you buy a car?
bk	I see.
sv	especially when you're in high traffic areas and have to mess with that all the time.
bf	That makes it very frustrating.
qy^d	Now this is a LeBaron?
sv	they really look sporty.
sd	but we bought it in eighty eight, you know, right at the end of the year when they were trying to get rid of them
sd	and we ended up, I think, with like a four and a half percent interest rate on a brand new car, and the payments.
ba	Well, that's great.
sd	and if you'd buy a new Oldsmobile they'd give you four hundred rebate, because it was their seventy fifth anniversary.
sd	and I really like comfort, you know, driving along the road and stuff.
b	Yeah.
qy	is it Mike?
qy	Do you repair your own car?
sv	Well, I tell you what, count your blessings because it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves.
sd	Well, that's why I don't do as much as I'd like.
qy^g	Because I mean they've got, they've gotten complicated haven't they? .
bh	Is that right?
sd	but I used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and,
sd	Course, they don't use, points anymore.
sd	But, they do still use plugs.
sd	And, now brakes, I've always done a lot of, you know, changing brakes.
sd	And I could always do the alternator, you know, and starter.
sd	but I have a lot of times.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	It probably slipped loose, didn't it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	well, it really wasn't quite, as bad as you thought, was it?
bf	Well, it was a lot of money,
qy^g	You had to have the help, didn't you?
qy	Well, do you still do much work on them, then?
^2	Disposal is a problem.
aa	That's true.
sd	I've quit doing that myself.
sd	but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil, you know.
qy	All right, do you do exercise?
b	Right.
b	Uh huh
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	Well, that's a hard question to answer because I do physical things, but I don't always set out for them to be exercise.
sd	but that's going to start soon again
sd	and, I play softball once a week, which is kind of more recreation than exercise.
sd	I think that's the basic point of it, is I, I don't enjoy it if I know that it's exercise,
sd	but if it's like a social activity or a recreational activity, I don't mind
sd	it's like feeding little babies food and telling them it's something else so that they'll eat it.
sd	I have to not know that it's exercise so I can do it.
sd	if it's exercise, it's a task.
sd	I don't want to do anything I have to do.
sd	but I won't do it if I have to do it.
sd	I'm twenty two.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
bf	Eating right and no cholesterol and all that.
sd	I'm doing that more and more than I used to
sd	I'm getting better about this knowing that I need exercise and doing it, but it's still at the task stage.
qrr	or are you,
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh
b	Oh.
b	Right,
b	Uh huh .
sd	I never got past that stage.
b	Right.
b	Right.
ba	That's good.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I haven't really brought myself to go to the the gym, because that's very stressful to me,
sd	and I need to find some place I could go and not feel like there's all these people who are just huge and hulking that are ...
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	we have a stationary bicycle and a stair step machine here at the house.
sd	I'll do those once in a while just you know, like at eleven thirty when Love Connection's on and I can't sleep,
sd	I'll get up and stair step for half an hour
sd	but I don't have a regular plan, that's
sd	I need to get started on that.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^2	Sleep .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
bf	That'll come some day when I,
sv	sounds good.
fc	Have a nice day.
fc	Bye.
sd	a lot of companies now are using, drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to root out the either, elementary or intermediate or advanced, drug users.
sd	And, I know the government you know, gives drug tests to all new appli , applicants coming into government.
sd	and and so, but, sometimes, you know, drug use can escape that.
sd	And, I have absolutely no compunction about, using any and all means to, you know, figure out or who has a drug problem and putting that guy into therapy whatever it is to, to, you know, break this, activity.
sd	but getting stoned or high is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful, then maybe there is no hope .
qo	What's your, feeling?
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well I think, the laws on, the first morphine laws were like ninety, or nineteen ten or nineteen five, something like that.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, the thing of it is the, tha , tha , that, that is, in many respects, you know, just, I think, an over simplification.
sv	I think th , th , th , there's so much criminal activity, that people go into to support drug habits.
sd	You know, they support drug habits with, you know, with things like, you know, burglary or prostitution or stuff like that,
sd	I I must admit that,
sv	I must admit that the production costs of these drugs are zippo compared to the street market costs and the costs to society,
sv	as soon as you get rid of one goon that's, that's involved in drugs and tha ,
sv	and then another one will jump up.
sv	but people want to, get stoned
sd	and I don't see that,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm in Dallas.
sd	There is a lot of theft, a lot of assault dealing with, people trying to get money for drugs.
sv	And, I think that's a national problem, though.
sv	It's not unique,
qy^g	Well, now, we're pretty close to the golden triangle, aren't you?
bf	research triangle and all of that.
sv	but, in all your cities now, it seems like there is a crowd that's really effected by this bill.
bh	Really?
bh	Really?
sd	a number every week.
sv	Seems like a lot of people don't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to.
bf	The economy is lousy .
b	Uh huh.
sv	Boy that really takes someone who is bold to do that.
qy	Well, now, do you find that security is very good in a, in a town home?
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, I think you hit on one point there is you know each other.
sd	and, course, everything's down ten to twenty percent now.
sd	they're not nearly as selective as they used to be.
sv	so, I'm sure that aggravates it also.
qw	So Frank, what, type of, budget do you or your family have?
sv	That's, sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what I have .
sd	so. I guess, I don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget,
sd	so it makes it a little bit easier.
sd	and also you know, I try to save a certain amount each month as well
sd	and I am pretty consistent from month to month
sd	and, whenever that changes I am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	probably within a year I would like to buy a new car.
sd	and I am making every effort to put a little bit away and increase the amount that I need for a down payment or whatever.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	 Right.
qy	Have you thought about, leasing?
bk	I see.
sv	But if you are rolling it over every three years, it might be advantageous to do that.
sv	You know, typically, if you purchase your own car you tend to make, the best returns after you pay it off.
sv	Of course, the longer you keep it beyond that point, the more profitable it is to own it yourself.
sd	I had a number of expenses .
sd	So, I just went through that whole set last year.
sd	I hope that I only have a slow period before I do that again .
o	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	no kids.
qy	Was that the animated version?
qy	Even better than ROGER RABBIT insofar as animation?
b	Yeah .
sd	that was made I don't know, several years back, I guess.
sd	had Claude Van Damme.
sd	It was just mostly centered upon his abilities to
aa	exactly.
sv	You know how they can make any single one of them in a movie to be a super superstar of any sort, you know,
sv	but Chuck Norris, of course, could be just about equal, if not more
sv	and all of them, I guess, could be in that fashion, or category.
sd	and he got killed.
sd	and then he moves on to L A to where she is to just help him out.
h	I don't know .
sd	Well, it was worth the buck I guess.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I guess what made it so good was the cinematography,
sd	Everything about it was good.
sd	but that was a well directed and acted movie.
sd	It's a little on the violent side
qh	but then what movie isn't anymore.
sv	and it's a matter of your taste,
ny	Yeah.
sv	And even on those type they don't show what you expect.
b	Right.
o	but what the hey.
o	This is America.
b	Yeah.
sd	That was pretty good.
sd	I don't have time to read the book.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	That's the magic of Hollywood, special effects.
sd	I hear this movie F X part two coming out is, pretty good.
qy	Did you ever see the original one?
sd	but it's F slash X.
sd	and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done.
sd	and using makeup and using the all the props and whatever to get to where he needs to go.
ad	But you need to rent the first one first.
sd	I don't know if they have the, original actors on that first one to that one.
sd	I expected those.
sv	I mean they were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there, I think.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Actual names, will not be used.
sv	Eventually I'm sure they will come out with the, the, the proper names.
sd	Kevin Costner I understand is supposed to be play Schwartzkopf, supposedly.
sd	That's just one of the many rumors that floats around.
sd	Or what you read.
fc	And, we'll Talk to you on the next go around.
qw	Jimmy , so how do you get most of your news?
qw^d	So, when you say the morning news, or evening news or national news is when?
sd	but I don't, subscribe to cable because of the poor service and also, because,
sd	and so I figured that amount of money I just donate to that.
bf	something.
qw	what, newspapers do you read?
sd	so she, you know, really needed to look at the help wanted ads
sv	and so often they tr , the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of news.
sd	but I mean, they say it's like the sixth grade reading level,
sd	but I swear it's at least second or third grade, sometimes.
sv	I think if you listen to like N P R or something like,
sd	when I get a chance, when I'm in the car a long enough time to listen to it, because I,
sd	one of them is leaving.
qy^g	I guess a year ago you're probably watching C N N a lot, right?
sd	Had that invasion or whatever it is.
ad	Look at the Smith trial.
sv	I mean, that was a joke.
sd	and he was just, I don't know, fixated on that, you know, just listened to it constantly.
sv	but that's not really providing you news.
sv	it's more like a media event rather than reporting.
sd	That's kind of boring to me, I think.
sv	they seem to be a part of life .
qw	how do you use them?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I watched my grandmother go into debt on them
sd	and then I guess my mother,
sd	I use them so that I build up a credit rating, you know.
sd	and we just keep a few you know, few of the major ones, and then use them once in a while for something,
sd	but we always pay it off right that month so that we don't pay any service charge.
sd	and we keep on top of what we're spending.
b	Yeah.
sd	that's what I feel.
sd(^q)	and I'll think, no I didn't know it was going to be that high.
sd	But so far, we've been able to pay it off every time
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Have you ever used Discover card?
sd	I'm not even sure what their interest rate is since I pay it off
na	I think Sears originally put it out,
sd	And there's no annual service fee, which is good.
sd	For the amount that I charge, I get two dollars back or something
sd	but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back.
sd	That's it.
sd	but, I'm not sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think it's best to keep the number down that you have.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^t	Well, Do you have anything else to say?
sd^t	I don't think I do either
fc	Well, it was good talking to you.
fc	Okay.
fc	Have a good evening.
fc	Bye bye.
qy	Have you got a boat ?
sd	but I've not had one the last couple of years.
qy	do you like boating?
sd	so we decided to sell it.
br	What's that?
sd^r	I loved having it.
bk	okay .
b	yeah .
sv	he needs his weekends free, to be able to use it or a day during the week or something,
sd	I had bought it used and kept it, , I don't know, ten years and got within, three hundred dollars when I sold it, of what I'd paid for it and had it all those years, you know.
sd	So you take care of them , they hold their value real well.
sv	So, you know, you couldn't complain about that.
sd^e	it was a , big boat, big ski boat type thing.
sd	I had a hundred sixty horse, Murcruiser in it.
sd	but I'm not too much of a fisherman.
sd	but I but I did enjoy owning a boat,
qy	Have you been sailing?
b	Uh huh.
sd	But I'd want to be with a skilled sailor .
sd	I've never wanted to bad enough to make any effort to do it, you know.
sd	And, at this stage of the game, I'm not that interested in it anymore.
sd	and parents' next door neighbors have a big barge
sd	so we we get out on the water occasionally, you know.
sd	and I'd have to go load it up the next day.
sd	Mount Vernon.
sd	Cypress Creek Springs.
sd^e	it's down at Mount Vernon.
sv	It's probably the prettiest lake in the state of Texas.
sd^e	it's just a hundred miles from here.
sd^e	I, you, you go down, yeah, thirty, thirty.
sd	It's east of here.
sd	Hundred miles due east of here.
qw	Where did you all move from?
bh	did you?
qw	How are you liking it?
ba	Well, good.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but, of course it's hard when you don't have any family around.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	and your wife's folks still live in Colorado?
sd	there are supposed to be, some people moving down here from Colorado Springs for T I.
sd^e^r	supposed to be.
qy	Do you work at T I?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	My wife does .
ad	So, tell me the last time you went for a boat ride.
sv	That had to have been fun.
qw	What kind of car would you like to buy next?
qw	Well, why would that be?
ba	well that's good.
qw	If you had, no financial requirements, if you could buy any car in the entire world, no matter what it cost, what would you buy?
bh	Do you?
qw	Which type of Cadillac, is your favorite?
b^m	The Seville.
sv	That's a sharp looking car.
sv	it always has been though. You know,
sv	It's always had it's own unique look.
sd	a couple years they had where the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it.
sd(^q)	I thought, now that looks sharp
^q	that looks real sharp.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but they're supposed to be just real smooth.
sv	Just a nice comfortable ride.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It'll go underneath the car instead.
sd	So that's a big safety factor they've got in them now.
b	yeah.
ba^r	that's great,
qy^d	So you say you've always have preferred General Motors products .
b	Right.
qw	What kind of, General Motors cars have you had in the past?
sv	Those are real nice riding cars too.
qr	Has that been the Cutlass or the Sierra?
bk	okay.
qy^g	now that's got that big V eight engine in it, doesn't it?
br^m	Has a little V Six?
bk	Okay.
ba	that's great
sv	That's always nice to get, reliability in a product. Especially when you're spending, you know, anywhere from fifteen to twenty five thousand dollars for a single item. You know,
sv	you just don't want any hassles with it.
sv	and I think a lot of car manufacturers don't take that into consideration you know.
sd	but that's been a key factor in me, is how reliable is this car going to be you know.
sv	but it's not the most important issue.
b	Right.
sd	Well, I've always been a Ford man, myself.
sd	But that's all right.
sd	You know, it's American made too which is good.
sd	So everybody has a truck
sd	I've just never had problems with them.
sd	I honestly think I would die before my truck would, keel over on me.
qy^d	You said you have four cats?
qw	How old are they?
b	gosh.
sd	I've had him probably five years.
sd	I lost one, one time,
sd	He jumped off the balcony actually, of a second story apartment.
sd	And he'd never been outside, like, you know, by himself outside.
sd	I mean, you would have thought a child had died.
sd	I had every friend I knew in the apartment searching for this cat.
sd	they thought that was so hysterical.
b	yeah.
sv	it's hard.
ba	how funny.
sd	the other two cats I have are outdoor cats.
sd	But the first one I got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there.
sd	If you shut that door he goes into hiding.
sd	I think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony .
sd	He's probably been through all kinds of nightmares.
am	Probably.
bh	Are they.
ba	no.
ba	my gosh.
ba	I imagine.
sd	I wonder how many of his lives he missed, when that happened.
qw	what did he shoot him with.
sv	People are crazy.
ba	Lord.
ba	man.
sv	It seems to mellow them or something.
aa	No.
sd	I keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because I feel like I can't take care of them as well because they're outside,
sd	and it worries me that one day one of them won't come back,
sd	But I can't give them up.
sd	I go hysterical when they don't come home.
sd(^q)	and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat.
sd	And you go crazy thinking it might be yours.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Ugh!
b	Really.
sd	It took me about two weeks to realize, that was real lonely.
sd	and, actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell drive thru that said free kittens.
^q	I'll call them.
sd	and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens.
sd	the whole big sad story.
sd	I felt so sorry for him after that.
sd	And you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers.
sd	and he said he was probably weaned too young, which he was, because his mom was killed,
sd	people who don't even like cats, like him.
sd	I had him declawed,
sd	he's just kind of there, real friendly and docile.
sd	we call that doing biscuits,
sd	it looks like their kneading bread . / * spelling "their" should be "they're"
sd	I had, I had a dog when I lived at home
sv	but they're a lot more trouble than cats actually.
sv	they do.
sv	it's so funny to get more than one cat together, because it brings out their personalities.
sv	And they just act so funny.
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
bf	A train of cats running around.
sd	I love them to death.
qw	What are your cats' names.
ba	how sweet.
sd	I have Xanadu and Precious, and Rascal.
sd	Precious is a medium hair yellow cat,
sd	and Rascal is a black and white short hair.
sd^r	They don't look a thing a like,
sd	and they came from the same litter and everything.
b	Oh.
^g	right.
b	Really.
b	Oh.
qy	Is she the oldest one?
b	Really.
sv	it's like the end of the world.
sd	I know that's how I am about Xanadu.
aa	definitely.
b	Yeah.
sv	but cats are good all the time.
sv	that would be a problem .
qy	do you ever read COSMO.
sd	It was so funny.
^q	Watch me.
aa	Definitely.
sd	There'd be no way.
o	well.
o	that's how life goes.
fc	Well, it's been nice talking to you.
fc	bye.
qy	Are you, involved at all?
b	Yes.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
o@	and I'd, * slash error Yes.
sv	So we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and, make it all even.
sd	it, certainly has no life threatening, capabilities you know, in my job.
sv	and, and there needs to be a line drawn somewhere reasonable and proper.
sd	but it's fairly simple.
sd	And then there's a much more, refined test, spectrography or whatever it's called. The chemo , chemotography to determine exactly what the things are.
sd^e	I've been with this company for sixteen years now.
qo	What do you think? .
sd	but then then, you know, the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently
sd	and, you know, the other two guys sat in the car
sd	and they didn't get beat up. You know.
sv	Rodney got beat up because he, you know, he pur , you know, he involved himself in some self destructive behavior.
sv	And, just like the burning and looting is self destruct.
sv(^q)	Everybody says well this is the nineties
qh	you know, some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area?
sv	With everybody with that mind set. They, they're they're going to, that whole area is going to be turned into residential ghetto, you know,
sv	and you might even be able to use it for a bombing test site, you know.
sd	I mean there are forty people that are dead as a result of that.
sd	And I'm just trying to determine, you know, how you weigh, you know, Rodney getting the hell beat out of him against, you know, forty deaths.
sd	And I'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and pursued it, you know, because I'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing.
o	no tears.
sd	You know, you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot, you know, in the street.
sd	No one would have stopped me.
^q	and I don't think like that.
sd	I'm a government employee.
sd	I'm with the F B I.
sd^t	and so, and, and the reason I'm doing this whole thing is because Rick, whose another government employee wanted segments of my speech, that that were done a year ago
sd^t	and he wanted another collection a year later.
sd^t	A year ago I did eleven calls.
qy^g	that was it, right? .
sv	I mean, everybody, not just like, you know, poor people and all that, you know. But, you know, senators' sons and all that stuff too.
sd	I just don't know if, you know, I was eighteen or whatever, I'd want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	It is,
b	Uh huh.
h	I mean, you know, I don't know .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and also, you know, you feel more like, you know, you're actually part of the community if you've done something, in it.
b	Uh huh.
aa	definitely.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	And I mean, just getting it going.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	In about six months we will .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	They have, that here.
sd	and, there was a, * end of slash unit? Yeah. / * should be indepedent slash unit
sd	Well, it was interesting because that's an interesting question, you know.
sd	I think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed .
sd	I don't remember for sure now.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but then they lost, too much business .
^q	and even if it's not environmentally safe, who cares, you know.
b	Yeah.
sv	it's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may, make some people realize that hey, you know, this stuff runs out.
sv	Of course, that's probably blasphemy for you to say, coming from where you are in Texas.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	so, You know, we're acutely aware of a lot of this.
sd	so you know, I wonder sometimes if he knows what he's doing.
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, I like to cook,
sd	but I don't like getting too awfully fancy about it, just because, it's too much pressure. You know,
sd	if I have people over for dinner, I like it to be nice and relaxed.
sd	And so I don't like or, or when they arrive, for me to be completely worn out.
aa	Exactly.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh .
bf	you'd just do it.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Boy I like that.
sd	and naturally this is appropriate because I'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night.
sd	So Tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	that's a good idea.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, one of my favorites if I don't want to have other people bring stuff, I just want to treat them is to make chicken and rice.
sd	It's very easy to.
qy^d	You don't like it?
sd	and then you just.
sd^e^m	over uncooked rice
sd	and it just.
sd	and it's really moist.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
cc	Well, I'll keep that one in mind.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
bf	you can get away with it even having a semi nice dinner,
sv	or, you know semi .
b	Yeah.
sd	you can really vary it.
sd	I think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water, two cups, broth.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've done it in the microwave so often lately because, it's really easy.
sd^r	But, I think it's about an hour.
sd	until the rice looks fluffy, and and not overdone. You know, before it gets overdone.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster.
sd	I liked your idea too, there.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	So how do you just figure ,
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
co	Well, I'm going to talk about when I was working as a teacher and when I was working at now.
sd	when I was a teacher, in Utah, I would generally wear, dresses and heels and things like that,
sd	and I wore heels anyway .
bf	it might kill you to go up and , walk up to the door
bf	but you're going to look nice for the kids .
sd	Well, I need all the height I can get .
sd	but then I would change, into heels, as soon as I got to my desk.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sd	So I did,
sd	so it was nice .
ny	uh huh.
ba	that's nice.
ba	Nice.
sd	and, I'm working at a day care right now.
sd	And so the way I dress is really different because I'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months.
sd	I wear, tennis shoes, and jeans and things that, you know, are sort of,
sd	it doesn't matter if I have to wash it a hundred times or something.
sd^e	but I never wore jeans because, I thought that was too casual .
aa	really.
sd	but I've seen. A lot of things I'm not used to yet,
sd	and I grew up in California.
sd	T I is a very casual atmosphere.
sd	and, on Monday I wear the worst looking one . Because it doesn't seem like people ar , you know, are that alive on Monday, you know,
sd	but mostly what I wear are skirts and blouses or, you know, skirts and, pullover sweaters or, you know, little two piece dress suits like,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	also, I mean there's you know, hundreds of people work for T I.
sd	And, you know, a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for the real, higher ups, like the, lawy , the T I lawyers, and, those that work for the higher executives, those secretaries. they really dress up all the time.
sd	So there's a good combination in the hallways all the time, you know .
b	Yeah.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And that's very acceptable at T I.
sd	I believe at I B M they make you wear a blue suit and, some kind of colored shirt and a tie.
sd	I would hate to be in that atmosphere.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
bk	I see.
sd	T I is everywhere.
b	Uh huh.
sv	that's a good idea.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	and if you happen to go into one of areas that is a smoke area and you don't smoke, you almost strangle.
sd	the smoking area, you know, it's closed in,
sd	I used to smoke a long time ago.
sd	That's one of the reason that I stopped .
sd^e	yeah, she always had to have a lot of clothes.
sd	my daughter, she's real good at finding sales though, you know.
sd	she'll buy a lot of, yeah, she'll buy a lot clothes, at the end of seasons, you know, and, just have them for the next year.
sd	and I, I'm going to be able to make my own clothes.
b	Right.
sv	because clothes are really expensive. You know,
sd	a little simple shell blouse, you know, that you can make for about, say ten dollars you know, at, at the most out of a decent fabric, boy, runs you like twenty something dollars in the store.
sd	Just a little shell to go under a suit, you know.
b	Uh huh.
bf	especially to pay that kind of money for it.
sd	I mean, she dressed him, fabulously.
sd	And then, seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff.
sd	So now she finds the basement sales just like, you know, everybody else.
b	Right.
aa	Yes,
b	Right.
sv	if you, if you're not buying the most expensive clothes out there the quality is really not that great, you know, for the price that you pay.
b	Right.
sd	you know, it was just a plain, you know, round, necked, sweater.
sd	I think maybe it was nine ninety nine or something.
sd	and after I wore it a couple of times I realized why it was, it was so cheap.
sd	and they had like just sewed it back together, right in the middle of the back, you know,
sd	wasn't a seam or anything, you know.
sd	And then I was told by somebody that works for J C Penney's that, Ross is just one of those places that sells seconds.
sd	they'll send them back every time.
sd	But places like Ross Dress For Less and, T J Max.
b	Uh huh.
^q	do you think it's possible to have honesty in government or an honest government?
ny	Yeah.
sv	That's a good point.
sd	It was just government in general. From times past, you know on
sd	and personally I feel there's probably some of each.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think that's very normal, that we should not ex , I think,
b	Yeah.
qy^g	That's a problem, isn't it?
sv	They lie to us because we don't want to hear the truth.
sv	If they tell us the truth, we don't elect them Especially with all this co , stuff coming up here lately about people's past,
sd	and I don't know why anybody would want to get under that scrutiny anymore.
sv	and we're getting away from what we ought to be looking at .
sv	I don't think there would be too many left .
ny	Uh huh.
sd	Tarrant County Junior College.
b	Yeah.
sv	and I don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally.
sv	but that, doesn't mean,
sd	I mean I don't know how many laws you would have to have.
sv	I mean I just think that's human nature that you're going to have corruption in government, in business, personal life, I mean, you know.
b	Right.
sd	but when I think about where I'd want to go, you know, this is still the best
o	Uh huh.
sd	They refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container
na	Right.
sd	on primarily on soft drink, pops and that kind of thing
sd	we do have one of the scrape metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well
sd	but then again it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city.
sd	Well, actually there's the opportunity for both.
sd	and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as well .
sd	but Central Canada tends to referred more to Ontario and Quebec
sd	there's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although, scouts and hockey teams and ball teams, those kinds, regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes.
sd^t	I chose that topic because I really like gardening as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard.
b	Oh.
sv	but you know you need to pretty soon.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	So now you have the chance to really create and spread out.
b	Uh huh.
bf	The grass not growing so fast .
b	Oh.
sd	We're not having to mow every week religiously
sd	I still have caladiums that are pretty, which is a surprise this late in the year.
sd	But like today, it's eighty five degrees
sd	it's really strange,
sd	But that'll change real quick .
sd	We'll wish we'd planted bulbs and pansies already.
ba	my gosh.
sd	And there just aren't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those extremes.
sd	Some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they don't make it through the two swings.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, the summers have gotten where they're a lot hotter
sd	We've noticed that crepe myrtles don't do as well as they used to and, pittosporum
sd	that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time
sd	you really take a chance with them freezing,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful, we really miss it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	we haven't seen that one yet.
qy^d	it wasn't that good.
sv	The most recent one that, my wife and I have seen was the CITY SLICKER.
sd	It was just a really funny movie.
sd	I mean, it just ran the gamut of emotion.
sd	but it was just all around entertaining.
sd	it's still on, to the best of my knowledge.
sd	I think it's less than two hours.
sd	we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever .
sd	I'm guessing probably an hour and forty five minutes, maybe.
sd	But excellent acting by Billy Crystal and Bruno Kirby,
sd	Jack Palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy.
sd	So we really enjoyed that.
sd	I think that, I can highly recommend that movie to see.
b	Yeah.
sv	in order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend, you've got to rent it on Thursday.
sd	They get they get taken up at the store,
sv	and, with luck, you'll have one or two that are good.
sv	Most of them are a coin flip .
b	Yeah.
sd	Quite frequently, we have our grandchildren on the weekends
sd	and,  generally try to stay in the at least P G range.
sd	He doesn't really pay attention.
sd	The five year old doesn't have the attention span, either.
sd	But the nine year old will watch anything that's on T V .
sd	but we can generally find something at the store for them to watch.
sd	PRESUMED INNOCENT was the one we rented, last weekend.
sd	Harrison Ford.
sd	and, a woman prosecutor in there is murdered
sd	so it's, And it's an extremely long movie.
sd	it's over two hours long.
sd	I enjoy them to a degree.
b^m	Save that for another day.
b	Yeah.
ny	yes.
sd	it was on T V recently, FATAL ATTRACTION.
sd	It's one that, once you've seen it once you really can't see it again
sd	so you know all the story and who did what and when it happened,
sv	so once you seen one that's a suspenseful type movie like that, then it's not good for a second watching particularly.
sd	At least I don't think so .
sd	we've watched WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S any number of times .
sd	It's just slapstick comedy .
sd	but we like BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE which is another funny one .
sd	we like to laugh .
sd	I don't want to go away depressed from watching a movie.
sv	Life's depressing enough .
fc	Well, I've certainly enjoyed talking with you.
fc	bye.
fc	Have a nice weekend.
fc	Okay.
fc	Bye.
o	Kay.
sd^t	I guess we're talking about exercise,
sd	I am twenty seven.
qw	What type of exercise do you do?
bf	you do.
ny	Yes.
qrr	or is it the same thing?
qy^d	And you do that every day
bk	okay.
qrr	or, do you belong to a group?
qrr	or do you go alone?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh .
b^m	young mothers or,
b	Uh huh.
sd	and that's what I do every day.
sd	When my wife let's me.
sd^e	I just shoot around by myself.
sd	I could eat all day and not gain an ounce .
b	Uh huh.
bf	You do exercise.
bf	You do it ,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
sd	but I don't know .
sd	so that's why I've kept active in that way.
sd	I do that.
sd	but it got too expensive,
ny	Yeah.
sd	a lot of people do that
sd	I had rather do other things.
bf	they come up here.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah
sd	There's Snow Bird or Alta.
br^m	Heavenly?
sd	I've never heard of that one.
nn	Huh uh.
sd	I know when I went, you can get sore easily
sd	and I am really sore after.
ny	Yeah.
sd	My legs really, really ache.
sd	I am using muscles that I have never used before.
sd^t	now since I got somebody from Arlington, Virginia one day .
ny	Yeah.
b	Oh
b^m	Birmingham.
sv	It's funny how many names have been used, all over the country.
sd	so mainly, text books.
sd^e	but, I really tend to like biographies a lot, not necessarily always heavy ones
sd	To me, half the time it's more fascinating than some of these made up stories .
sd	it happened.
bh	Really?
sd	That was my thing for a while.
bh	really.
ba	it sounds like fun.
sd	Margaret Truman Daniels writes a lot those.
bh	Really?
sv	Sounds like something she would write.
sd	and they always sell well.
sd	I know, some of the British people laugh at us because we're so enthralled with their royalty.
sv	our movie stars.
aa	right.
aa	yes.
sd	I always like those.
qy	Have you ever read anything by Susan Howatch?
qy	Isn't she fabulous?
sd	I'll skip everything just to get back to the book .
sd	I probably have missed the last few since I've been back in school.
sv	Well, she can turn them out overnight, I swear.
ad	And think how rich she is.
aa	yeah.
sd	And then make movies out of some of them.
sv	and they're so such a higher intellectual level, because she quotes a lot, you know.
sv	so she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers,
qy^g	I don't think they've ever made a movie, do you?
sd	I really just thought about it now
h	I don't know.
sv	They're so big
sv	it would be like another GONE WITH THE WIND, I guess another three hour movie .
sd	It's about one of my favorite movies.
sd	I wasn't too .
b	Right.
qy	Do you know anyone that's read it?
sd	I haven't heard of anybody that's read it, either.
sd	I think it was on the best seller list, though for a while.
sd	they can find guilt or innocence
sv	but then when you quantify things and might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate, that they might leave it to somebody else who, has expertise in that.
sd	and one thing that you get if you have some expertise is, you know the range of possible values or terms or, you know, how heinous was the crime.
sd	and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three.
qh	And so how do you relate as to whether this particular armed robbery was you know, worth five years or twenty five.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	One is, you often see in the headlines the big numbers.
sd	and many of those get overturned or get reduced in terms of sentences, or get changed by a judge or an Appeals Court
sv	so we don't know what is really going on, what is, really the range of sentences or awards that are actually, in the end applied.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	one is, it's restricted in the sense that, juries only decide the charges that are actually, brought, you know
sd	and you can decide guilt or innocence on that.
sd	The other thing that juries are restricted on and at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things even in my own experiences, that you usually don't get to hear all the information.
sd	but often juries hear only a fraction of the story when they have to decide guilt or innocence.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and the truth that's brought out is, as I say, when I've heard about, you know,
sd	I mean you can say,
aa	yeah.
sv	because stories look very different when you hear different parts of the truth.
sd	and, she's only between six and eight, six to eight weeks old
sd	and, I can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog, though.
sd	and she's almost housebroken.
sd	I mean she actually asks to go out.
sd	I can't imagine what, would have been wrong with this dog,
b	Uh huh.
bh	really.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but, managed to get him to a veterinarian in time,
sd	and on huge doses of antibiotics, he actually got over it with, seven hundred dollars in vet bills,
sd	but he had actually was able to get him over that.
sd	and then he got hit by a Cadillac.
sd	that was really hard.
sd	and the dog was being house sit, or dog sit, whatever, by some friends of mine down the street,
sd	so they just felt absolutely awful.
sd	and, She was really attached to it,
sd	but now, I've got another one,
sd	see, it, it was just over a year.
sd	didn't, didn't have one for a whole year.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
^q	there's no way,
sd	and by Christmas time we went down to the I or, I gue , Humane Society and got another one, a stray.
sd	but, mom went an,
b	Yeah.
sd	Well hopefully this one here, Cocoa will live a full life .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	they're kind of like, get that permanent smile to them,
sd	I don't think I've ever seen them not look happy.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	they had a ball romping around,
sd	and, you know, you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in.
sd	And, this Golden Retriever jumped in the, really fast moving, river current,
sd	I don't think he'd swum before.
sd	But he jumped in the river.
sd	I was careful to keep her away from the, the fast moving water,
sd	And up here the waters probably about forty degrees right now.
sd	He loved it.
sd	I pulled her out and, then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad,
sd	but, she got over it,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	but, she could go in sometime if I'm watching her,
bh	really.
b	Yeah.
nn^r	no.
bh	really.
sd	it wasn't like he didn't
sd	but if you wanted to get him wet, forget it.
b	Yeah.
sv^r	obstinate.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and it did look like it'd be a good movie,
sd	really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately.
sd	But, I got to do more fun things.
sd	and so I travel a lot.
sd^e	I'm a engineer at the Rolm Laboratory, Griffis Air Force Base, up here,
sd^t	That's how I got into the switchboard project and all that,
sd	But it's nice having a dog here,
sv	what's the word I'm looking for, lots of affection, no co , unconditional affection from the dog.
b^r	yeah.
aa^r	no.
o	Okay.
ad	So tell me about CHINA CRY.
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Interesting story.
sd	and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly.
bh	That recent.
sd	I see what you mean.
sd	Well, I guess what I saw most recently and luckily I saw it only a week ago so I'd remember remember it well was, sort of light by comparison.
sd	and, we ended up going to see GREEN CARD.
na^r	GREEN CARD.
sd	This was his American film debut
sd	And basically he played, a Frenchman who married an American girl, in a marriage of convenience so that he could get his green card, which is what an alien needs to work in this country.
sd	And, because she could claim she was married, she could get, an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive building in New York that had an, an, an outside garden, which is very unusual there.
sd	and that was sort of her dream.
sd	but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was.
sd	He'd been working in a restaurant when they met.
sd	And, they had to learn all about each other basically in a weekend.
sd	you knew what was going to happen, of course. That they would fall in love.
sd	and and when they went to the query or inquisition or whatever, they did perfectly
sd	and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers.
sd	I just got done reading a magazine or a couple magazine articles about the, new Saturns.
sd	and, although I can't afford it right now, I would just love to have one.
sv	and, it seems to just blow the compe , competition away.
sd	and they seem to be really good cars for it.
sd	can't afford it.
sd	I don't make any money
sd	But it would be nice, just like scrap it and go for the Saturn.
sd	The nice thing about autocrossing is you can do both.
sd	and it's like really large, parking lots. And pylons and things.
sd	They get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class.
aa	Yeah.
qw	what are you thinking about buying?
b^m	The Legend.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	a lot of the B M W s are produced in, Stutgardt and Munich
sd	and, I was really impressed by the, factory, tours and such for B M W.
b	Yeah.
sd	and, it was amazing how they were completely opposed.
sd	and no two of them are alike .
sd	I think I like the Porsche's philosophy a little bit better, although it's not really practical.
sv	Unless, it's a toy.
qh	What kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to use it for?
ba	Wow, yeah.
ba	That's cool.
sd	I was impressed by the Mercedes, too.
sd	I really like the Mercedes.
qy	And is it different for the B M W?
ba	I can imagine that.
qrr	or is that a crime free zone there?
sv	I'm afraid you're right.
ba	my.
ba	boy.
qy	By your house?
ba	my goodness.
sv	that's got to be a frightening way to spend an evening.
ba	boy.
ny	Unfortunately yes.
sv	I think, you know, as any city grows up, you get the hoods and the riffraff and everybody else in there,
sd	and now you know, you can tell the change, for sure.
sv	Well, with all the, Central Expressway, with all the stores and the, restaurants and the convenience stores and all that kind of stuff, it's just prime pickings for people driving by.
sv	that couldn't be too far from you, neither.
bk	Okay.
bk	okay.
sd	I don't know, how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody
qy^g	It's kind of stupid, isn't it.
sv	It's, looks like easy pickings
qy^g	and away you go, right.
aa	I think you're right, although I think that may be an excuse for people, too.
na	Right.
sv	and I think when you have haves and have nots, you're always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money.
qw	Where do you work?
qy	is that Amelia Earhart, School there?
qy^g	That's a pretty rough area there, isn't it?
ba	my goodness.
sv	Definitely that area, that's big time.
sv^r	Big time there, sure is.
sd	I don't think I'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself .
sv	that's the worst neighborhood in the whole area.
sd	and he was in Arlington, Virginia .
sv^t	Well, anyway, we've got a easy subject.
ad	You go ahead first, if you'd like.
sv	you know you get so busy.
aa	I know.
qy	Are they little?
bf	they're pretty young.
sd	my kids are older
sd	so I don't know some of those shows now, like I used to .
b	Right.
sd	I really like,
sd	I make a point of that.
sd	I think when it's good, it's just a scream.
sv	Half the time you see these people on an interview show, they act just like they do in their parts .
sd	and he acted about the same .
b	Yeah,
sd	Well, I watch more now because, well I had been going to school for years and have really been too busy
sd	I just make a point of seeing those.
sv	they are just gems of shows. I mean, really, fabulous in every way .
sd	that's Wednesday at, seven thirty.
ad	well, maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime.
sv	It wouldn't take, Wouldn't take much to get hooked on those .
sd	so, I watch those.
sd	but it's still kind of new.
sv	Excellent actors.
sd	it came on after something we used to watch
sd	I can't take all these shows on because next semester I'm not going to be able to watch hardly any television.
sd	Well then, it will be mostly reruns, I guess .
sd	And by the end of February, the way they do it nowadays.
qy	was she the best one? Was she the best one on that old show?
bh	Really?
qy^g	they had a big fight on that show, didn't they?
sv	They were all accusing each other of everything in the world .
sv	you never will, probably.
sv	Well, I think the latest soap opera for people is the Kennedy trial for those who have cable.
sd	I don't have cable.
sv	It's just as wild as any soap opera, from what I hear on the news.
sv	And I think he's guilty as the devil.
sv	There's never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that. Because you know they tear you to shreds, especially those rich high powered lawyers.
sv	so, It should be interesting.
sd	I never have the nerve to buy the thing.
sd^e	I don't care anything about that.
sd	you know, occasionally, some ice skating will come on, on a Sunday or during the Olympics
sv	I think it's so beautiful.
qy	Well, have you seen a new movie lately?
b	Uh huh.
qw	what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though?
qy^d	Well, maybe you have seen DANCES WITH WOLVES.
b	Okay.
qo	What did you think of that one?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and that's when the movie was filmed,
sd	my dad lives in the state capital, which is Pierre
sd	In fact, the scene, the big buffalo herd scene, that was a live scene.
sd	so we are watching the movie in the movie theater in Pierre
sd(^q)	and, just every time I would start to get into the movie, and it was getting good someone in the crowd would yell, hey, there's John Red Eagle, you know
sd	or, you know, they'd start recognizing people.
sd(^q)	I'd go now which one could that be you know,
sd	and I'd start trying to focus in on people instead of picking up the overall,
aa	Exactly.
sv	I think it was very one sided.
b	Sure.
sd	and, it was a similar, situation with the Iroquois Indians attacking an army fort.
qy	have you seen PRETTY WOMAN?
sd	Now I thought that was a good show.
sv	it was kind of like the STAR WARS series, you know, just something a little different, yet believable.
qy	are you going to see this next one that's coming out?
qy	Have you seen the rest?
sd^r	but I think I've missed one.
qy	Was that here in Dallas?
sd	Because we had one here in Dallas.
b	Uh huh.
qo	what do you think about it?
aa	yeah.
sv	like in the future, I think all women are going to work.
sv	but that will be it,
sv	or either they'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you you know, just continue right on with your work.
sv	I mean, it really is coming to that because most women now days cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them.
sv	They can't even afford to take off, you know, to have children it seems like.
b	Yeah.
sd	Now, I was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where you know, when I had them and when they were small, until my youngest got in junior high, I didn't have to work.
sd	but I didn't.
sd	Let me tell you, you go without a lot of things that you wo , you know.
b	yeah.
sv	Well it's getting where if you're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you can't hardly afford to have over two.
sd	and my youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon,
sd	and if I had a third one, I just don't know where it would come from.
sv	when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got.
sv	but still, it cost a lot.
sv	and the books are outrageous. I mean, absolutely outrageous,
sd	and it was like ninety six dollars.
sd	And this book is a little bitty skinny book.
sd(^q)	I said my goodness, what is it, lined in gold, you know,
sd	and, if I'd of probably had three or four children, I don't see how we could have made it, you know, without me working.
sd	but I think I would have had to work.
sd	you know, even though he brings in a real good living and everything, in order for me to keep up, I would have had to work.
sv	and you work,
sv	There isn't going to be any of this, you know, very few people will ever stay home.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well you know, I can't imagine how I did, because now I work all the time,
sd^r	and, I can't imagine how I stayed home.
sd	but. I mean it is so far down the road,
sd	now when I graduated high school, the thing,
sd	I mean that's just the way it was, you know.
sd	and the woman stayed home and took care of them,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and we got married right out of high school, well a year after I got out of high school ,
sd	and I wasn't ready for kids.
sd(^q)	And, everybody thought, my gosh, what is the matter with her, you know.
^q	but that, you know, you better just get ready now.
sd	But I was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time, they had kids within a year.
sd	I don't care what anybody tells you.
sd	now, she says that, you know, maybe when she's thirty she might want a child then.
sd	And, even though I'd like to have grandchildren, I can see her point.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean, it really does. Accept for what we give to my daughter, to, you know, put her through college and stuff. / * Spelling/usage: "Accept" should be "Except"
sd	or we go on trips, the more or less like entertainment stuff,
sd	but, I'm older.
sd	but now I could not go back and do it.
sd	but, to me it feels like I must have done nothing.
sv	And I think it's just the new way that people are thinking.
sd	but where I am, just like all the hospitals, they're getting day care.
sd	like you said if you had four kids, or even if you had two kids, you would be paying all your salary to pay for those two kids to go.
sd	but it's mainly the hospitals.
bh	really.
qw	what do you think you would offer as far as, information about selecting a school?
b	Uh huh.
sd	but I know there are some fields where it's really not necessary.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qw	What was your degree in?
sd	and, I have a friend,
sd	University of Texas, Dallas.
sd	That's where Texas Instruments is.
sd	I think if you're going into like, law or medicine, a very particular, very specific field, even engineering, you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public, institution.
sd	And, it's a lot cheaper.
sd	This is about twenty years ago.
sv	I mean as far as selecting a school, I, I feel that, a lot of it depends upon the major.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	I'm a speech therapy major
sd	and fortunately I have a good medical background,
sd	it's actually turning out to be more useful than what I thought.
sd	And, I also have a good languages background, linguistics. And some psychology.
sd	So, it's all working together.
sd	The only field I'm not familiar with really is education, which requires about four or five different fields really.
sd	Uh huh.
bf	so you are a disgruntled graduate student .
o	Bah, humbug.
sd	And I mean, that was like a can of worms.
sd	and it was just .
aa	I know.
sd	it used to be Jewish, you know.
b	Yeah.
aa	I know,
b	Yeah.
qh	what's going to happen when she gets there.
sv	You know, all of her dreams will be dispelled .
sv	I, I think it's probably more embarrassing and very painful.
sd	I see I see that happening.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And I think probably the biggest.
sd	I was in the Air Force?
sd	I just wish that there was something else that, that I could have done, you know, with,
qw	what was your job?
sd	I was a linguist .
br^m	In Tak?
sd^e	I wasn't.
sd	after about eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training, you know, it's something, you know,
sv	I think that's why, you know, children really need to think about the field they're going into, and I mean, spend a lot of serious reading I mean, not just thinking about.
sv^r	They actually should do some reading
sv	I, I, I think, I think there's a lot to be said for kids working after school.
sv	I mean, they find out just how much of a people person they are.
sd	and I knew exactly what they were going to do and say.
b	Uh huh.
qy^t	You want to start?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and you see women going off to wars as well as men.
sd	And I also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the, day care centers.
sd	they term it as more, creative. But, that they, are much more contentious.
sv	So, I don't, I guess we'll have to see another generation to see what differences a child being brought up, you know, in kind of a, community, rather than a home.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b^r	uh huh.
qw	What do you mean?
bk	yeah.
ba	That's strange.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa^r	that's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Right.
qy^d	To come in and live with them?
qy^d^r	To come in and live with them?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
bf	And then you might have more control over, the morals that they would be taught rather than in like a classroom or a day care center.
sd	I know the day care centers are not cheap either.
sd	They have to go with a single, I mean a baby sitter more or less.
sd	But I think it's like, about sixty dollars a week for two children if I'm not mistaken.
sd	And you have to pay that whether you're on vacation, you know, and taking care of the children or if the children are at home, sick.
sd	I mean, that is, you know, just a rate that you have to pay
sd	I think, I really don't have a vision .
sv	I, I think that they will be more in the work place because, the door's open.
sd	but, it seems in my experience I'm running across single women all the time.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
ft	Thank you very much.
fc	It's been interesting.
fc	Okay.
sd	All right, this is easy for me since I,
sd	I do about forty percent of my time on the road.
sd	I eat differently than what I could eat at home or around here.
sd	I don't have to really worry too much about price considerations because I, you know,
sd	I, I like different types of food.
sd	and that's Houston's.
b	okay.
sd	There's a restaurant right outside of Reading, Pennsylvania, it's called Alfredo's that does not look like a restaurant that you would really want to recommend to a lot of people.
sv	Of course, not too many people want to rush back to Panama, the country, Panama.
sd	this is the country this is the country Panama, all right?
sd	I'd have to go back through some expense reports.
sd	So, you know, I don't know what's down there, the ones out in Addison.
ng	Not particularly
qw	which one were you going to recommend?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Okay,
sd	I'm writing it down .
b	Okay.
sd	I've been there.
sd	one down there is I think it's an old schoolhouse.
sd	but I don't care for the clowning around.
sd	I've had,
sd	I've had excellent food there.
aa	True.
sd	I make it a habit of always going out to Pasta Oggi's which is right down there in Ad ,
ny	yeah.
bh	Really?
b	Uh huh.
sd	This is going to give me some more places to go.
sd^t	well, they don't always.
sd^t	I they've been doing that when, the circuits are busy
sd^t	I guess that's what they need for their machines to get everything down pat,
fc	It was a pleasure talking to you.
fc	You bet,
qw	What kind of pets do you have?
b^m	One rotten cat .
sd	I heard a laugh in the background.
qy	Don't you like cats?
b	yeah.
qw	How does he treat the other people?
ba	Wow.
qy	Did he raise him or something?
ba	that's interesting.
sd	We have a mutt.
sd	Well, we named it Hooper because that's where we got it from.
sd	a lot of people, drop off abandoned pets at her house
sd	so she would neuter them give them all their shots
sd	and we got it because my wife stays here at home alone while I go to work
sd	so that's mostly why we got it. To keep her company while I am away at work.
sd^e	Right now it is.
sd	but right now we haven't had any,
sd	but it's pretty good training, I think really, keeps her on her toes .
sd	you couldn't do anything.
sd	But, I mean, that did more responsibility. When it's yours and not your brothers .
b	Uh huh.
sd	Ours is, like a cockapoo.
sd	I think it's half cocker spaniel and half poodle.
sd	But, it's a really good dog.
sv	they seem I mean, listen better or something.
qy	Is your cat a purebred?
qy	Would you ever want a dog in the family?
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
sd	probably the favorite instrument would be, the violin.
sd	and, sometimes I enjoy listening to, fiddle music.
sd	and it's kind of fun to listen to the fiddle pans .
bf	Chris Xeros.
ba	you lucky thing.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	You grew up with his children, too, then?
ba	gosh.
qy^g	small world,
b	Oh.
sd	I played violin in the orchestra for several years you know,
ny	yeah .
sd	So, I know Chris .
aa	Most of the time .
sd	So, he's about ready to retire, another year
sd	it's daughter, it's his daughter that,
b	Oh.
qr	Was it a boy or a girl?
qw	What did they name him?
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
aa	Of course.
b	Oh.
b^r	yeah.
qy^d	so you've heard the Richardson Symphony?
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you have a favorite instrument?
b	Yes.
bh	did you?
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
qy^d	And it played by itself?
qy^d	Well, I mean, but you didn't have oboe or something with it?
b	Oh.
sv	Well, yeah that's, I bet that was nice.
b	Oh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	So, I always think it's a nice break from the traditional organ or piano.
sd	or it makes an elegant wedding to have something else.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
qy	does it offer, like band, or some of the instruments?
bk	Okay.
b	Right.
b	Right.
fe	Gosh.
sv	you got a little ways to go, too .
sd	I've learned a lot about playing the piano.
sd	I sort of watch their technique, too, and see if it corresponds up to what she's learning.
sd^r	So, it's been fun.
qy	All right?
qw	How many kids do you have? .
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
nn	No.
sd	We've been trying for about two years but no luck yet.
aa	Uh huh.
t3	She has just three kids, eleven, nine, and eight.
b	Uh huh.
aa	All right.
qy	do you have a lot of activities with your kids?
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	So they're pretty good kids, huh?
sd	But, my Dad,
sd	So that's how we spent most of the time with him.
ny	Yeah.
qy^g	That was a dead giveaway, huh?
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd	I was going to say, my sister wasn't spoiled very much.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And we're planning on having my wife stay home.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Sounds like you're, have a handle on it.
sd^e	not right now.
sd	We used to live up in Seattle for a couple of years.
o	Okay.
sd	and before then I was from Utah.
sd	and then, now we're in Iowa .
bh	really.
b	Oh.
sd	and I do fabric painting.
qo	How about you?
b	right.
b	really.
sv	well those take a lot of time.
sd	and I just don't have the patience to just, you know, do something.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	and I've done a quilt for our bed,
sd	I just went around the design in the quilt.
sd	I didn't piece it or anything like that
ny	Uh huh,
qy	are you familiar with that?
b	okay .
ba	my God.
sd	But, I used to do more before I had, before we got our baby,
b	Uh huh.
aa	exactly.
qy	does that make sense to you?
b	really.
b	Oh.
sv^t	I guess we're recorded.
qy	do you have any hobbies that you like to do?
sd	In fact, he's out there right now before it gets dark trying to get in his miles for the time.
sd(^q)^t	do you do any handicraft type things, I think was the question.
sd	whittling or ,
sd	and I've gotten to where I have started selling them at craft shows and things.
sd	but most , of them have worked out pretty good .
ba	Oh!
sd	I didn't know there were such things.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	you're not in , into hacking or whatever .
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	you said you did cycling?
qw	What was the other thing?
b^m	Backpacking.
sd	and my daughter was in Girl Scouts until just about a year ago
qy	Have you been backpacking anyplace exciting?
b	Uh huh.
bf	that one.
b	Okay .
qy^d	by Fort Sill there?
qy	Have you gone, like to Fillmont with the Boy Scouts?
sd	I've always thought that would be a real fun thing to do.
qy^d	like know, for a vacation you'd go backpacking?
qy^g	and you volunteer for the Boy Scouts,
b	Uh huh .
qy	do you ever, you know, just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, my other things that I like to do in my spare time, I like swimming.
fp	Hello,
fp	this is Lois.
sd^t	And, I called you know, from the, the T I Data Base Calling Instructions.
sd^t	this is about changes in the women in the,
qy^g	there's really a lot, isn't there.
sv	I think there really is.
qy^g	I guess the work force would be the main, wouldn't it.
aa	All right.
qy^t	Are you ready now?
sv	like I said I guess it would be the work force, you know, as far as changes in the generations.
sv	I think now, you go to work when they're six weeks old, you know,
sv	And I feel like the next generation, you'll probably just work right along with your husband, you know.
sv	And it's just going to get better.
sv	It really is.
sd	I can't either, not a one.
b	Uh huh.
sv	even in Washington, you know, there seems to be a lot more women involved.
b^r	yeah.
bf	and that would be it.
sv	I kind of think, maybe in time, that, you know, you'll go by social security numbers, you know,
sv	and that way they can't say well they picked a male over a female, female over a male, you know,
b^r	yeah.
sv	just go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications you know, that you have.
sv	And then if you get it, you know then,
b	Uh huh.
sd	As a matter of fact, that's what I'm doing.
sd^e	it sure is.
aa	It sure is.
b	Oh.
sv	that is.
b	Uh huh.
na	I do,
sd	I think it's great.
sd	and she'll work two,
sd	and we just share off like that.
sd^e	we get the full benefits.
sd	But we've just really got a wonderful system that we're working under.
sd	and that way we're not really missing any thing out, you know, of children,
sd	but we don't want to miss any of those P T A s and, you know, all of that.
sv	I think it's great,
sd	and I look for more of that in the next generation.
sd	I do too.
sd	or just forget it.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well I think we've really come a long way in that because,
sd	but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off.
aa	yeah.
aa	I do too.
b^r	yes.
aa	They really are.
fc	I know the feeling.
fc	Bye bye.
qw	Well, what is your favorite kind of music?
aa	same here.
ny	Yeah.
sd	well, I guess I like a wide range. everything from Baroque through at least some modern music.
sd	We've been sort of opera fans for a few years now.
sd	the places we've gone they sing in the original languages.
sd	Like the Dallas opera here normally does, I guess.
sd	Well, one thing that's helped us a lot is that, you know, you can buy a lot of these operas now on video tape
sd	and then you can enjoy it in the, theater.
sd	But, you know, the, Dallas opera now has, super titles on all their performances I think.
sd	Well, they give an English translation on a screen up above the stage.
b	Yeah.
sd	In fact, they even do that for operas sung in English, because it is hard to understand the words sometimes.
sv	he's, definitely one of the top of that era.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh .
qw	how old are they?
qr	So they're doing this in school, or what?
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, you've got half a string quartet there.
b	Yeah.
qy	Well, since you seem to like, Italian music, have you ever, gotten into Gabrielli or anybody there in that era, the, period right before, actually before Vivaldi, I guess?
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
qy	can't you get records through that or something, recordings?
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah,
aa	right .
bf	So, they're actually commissioned performances.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but if I get involved in one of those things, I end up spending all my money on on music.
sd	I almost, bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when I got into the Columbia Record Club many years ago.
sd	and I got a lot of bills .
sd	So we have to watch that.
qy	do you play any instrument yourself?
qy	Okay, Chuck, do you have any pets there at your home?
qw	And what kind do you have?
b	Uh huh .
sd	he's probably, a good two years old, big, old, fat and sassy tabby.
qw	how's the disposition of your Siamese cat?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	He's, been so mean to her .
sd	We've had him for about two years
sd^r	he bites her.
sd^e	he has a couple of times,
sd	and he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him
sd	He won't even let my son shower.
sd	So he's quite a animal .
b	Yeah.
sd	well, we did, actually take him to the pound a couple of times, you know because we just couldn't have him being so aggressive towards the girl,
sd	and we do keep our daughter away from him.
sd	Were it not for my son, the cat would not be in this house .
sd	So, we gave him up and tried.
sd	but we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog,
sd	and it was unfortunate.
qy	So have you tried any other pets?
b	Oh.
ba	my word.
qy	And do they just paper train it or something?
sv	Otherwise they're pretty smelly .
sd^e	we don't have cable.
bh	Is that right?
sd^e	Elton.
sd	It's north of Salt Lake City, Utah
sd	we're only about ten minutes from Ogden.
sd	So, we're kind of country but not too.
qy	Do you?
sd^t	well, see, I'm getting so many calls to Texas.
sd^t	I've been doing it for about two weeks
qw	So how do you get most of your current event information?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	you keep up on what's going on.
b	Yeah.
sd	and so I get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then, talking with people and just hearing what's going on. .
sd	Just the regular channel just channel eight.
sd	that's the, eyewitness news.
b	Yeah.
sv	and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name.
sv	I think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on.
sv	I mean, it just covers your basic, you know, violent crimes you know, and, and your catastrophes with weather and stuff,
sv	but other than that, you really don't know what's going on.
sd	and, I guess I do read other magazines, too, to get my information.
b	Right.
sd	I used to read every month a READER'S DIGEST
sd	or if I, you know, am interested in something, of course, when we were in war, I read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on.
sd	but I just can't seem to find the time.
sd	If they put it out in a video, or on , not a video but a cassette tape or something, where you could just listen to it I would do that while I was doing other things.
sd	You know, we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas
sd	that we want to hear what's going on with the economy, what's being done to help it, what's going on in other countries, what's, you know, just more information.
qy^d	Well, I guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the, summer olympics .
sd	I know, we're trying to get tickets to it right now.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b^r	right.
sd	and I think that's fine, I would like to see more time spent on other things.
sv	short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it.
sv	the short term, the recession is getting top attention.
sv	And that effectively adds to whether it's officially on the books or not.
sv	And that's got to be paid.
sv	It can only hurt the deficit picture.
sv	and the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without, bringing on serious problems for the longer term.
sv	So that, that's the current predicament.
sv	It's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is.
sv	Well, well, first of all you look to the Fed to fight the recession as indeed it has, with interest rates.
sv	Well, at the moment we're doing very well on inflation.
sv	That's the sort of upside to the deficit.
sv	That's the upside to the recession.
sd	at various places to look for cutting the budget, first of all I consider more defense cuts than are already planned depending on the world situation.
sv	the Reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor but left them for the middle class,
sv	Also somewhat is to collect owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed.
sd	A lot of education aid has gone to so called trade schools which are sort of not colleges
sd	but schools that teach you trades, you know, beautician well, often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition, and the school gets paid off immediately,
b	Yes.
sd^t	I guess we're going to discuss food and cooking.
qy	Do you enjoy cooking?
sd	I, I enjoy cooking when I have time.
sd	I don't enjoy preparing three meals a day everyday .
sv	It gets kind of boring.
qw	How big is the family you cook for?
sd	and two of them are teenage boys,
bh	Are they? .
sd	It's just absolutely incredible .
bh	Does he? .
qy	do you have any favorite things that you serve when you are doing a special meal? Favorite recipes that you've come across or,
b	Uh huh.
qy	Out on the grill?
b	Uh huh.
ba	Ooh .
b	Uh huh.
ba	yeah.
sd	My husband really likes seafood.
sd	but I like it.
sd	and it's really like a soup that you serve over rice.
sd	And, it has oysters and shrimp and crab in it.
sd	That's kind of Louisiana I think if you do that.
sd	and I freeze two containers of it.
sd	But neither of my kids will eat it. You know,
sd	so then they eat a pizza or .
sd	a friend gave me a recipe that I really like for chicken enchiladas.
qy	Have you made them?
bh	Does he,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	Is that what he uses?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and you can make a lot at one time when I needed to make something to give somebody. You know, like, you know, to take over to somebody's house or something else.
sd	it's nice when it makes, a lot because you can feed your own family
b	Uh huh.
qw	What, what does it have in it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	Sometimes those are the best ones,
b	Uh huh.
ba	that sounds good.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That sounds good.
qy	You cook the rice before you put it in?
b	Yeah.
sv	I bet the mayonnaise in there kind of gives it a tang that would be good.
qy^d	I guess I would now use the new mayonnaise free.
sv	That's really wonderful that they're coming out with so many new things like that because like I told my husband this summer, I love to eat, you know, chicken salad and tuna salad and stuff like that
sv	and, you know, basically it certainly a low calorie, you know, good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there and spoil the whole thing.
sd	Well now, I'm just putting more and more in .
sd	and now it's like twelve.
fe	Oh!
b	Anyway . Yeah.
b	Yes .
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bf	That's when they, As our family would say, pig out .
ba	That's good.
sd	one of my boys that's, twelve, has high cholesterol.
qy	Have you ever found out about your kids.
sd	I think it's mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high things in cholesterol.
sd	so he needs to be careful again.
sd	So we've really been talking about the foods, you know, for him to be sure to eat
qw	Anyway, what are your first comments on that subject?
qy^d	Defense?
qy^r	Have private enterprise do it?
sd	I mean, they're talking about, having it, as a, you know, business. you know, to, so, you know, the government doesn't have to deal with it.
sd	so, or, obviously.
sd	but, But see they don't have enough, you know, there's not enough room in these prisons and that, to continue funding it.
sd	They think they need to, maybe have, you know, private enterprise come in.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and all those European countries, they pay all the way through college and stuff like that.
sd	But here, you know, it's just up to high school.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	But they can't just bring somebody in without even having gone to, you know, school in that area before they can work, you know, for a lawyer as a paralegal.
qy^c	Is that better?
bk	Okay.
sd^c	so I changed that.
sv	but, you know, I think, maybe they need to, help promote that more. Give incentives like, if they do bring somebody on, they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is, you know, for them to train people, you know, stuff like that. Programs like that, you know.
sd	I don't know, you know, what kind of options they've got.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And then out of that percentage, only so many can get their degree.
sd	But, you know, most people I knew have gone and got their degree.
sd	And they go to college, etcetera.
b	Yeah.
sv	And, the you know, money being spent and the goods flow in and you know, we don't, sell products abroad as much as we bring in.
o	I don't believe that we're ,
qy	I don't think they, do they do newspapers?
b	Yeah.
sd	They pick up newspapers and, you know, milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans, you know, like soup comes in and stuff.
sd^r	They pick up everything.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah .
aa^r	I know it.
sd	It piles up.
h	I just don't know.
sd	you can't really unload all your stuff.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	I know it.
ny	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	you ought to, because the, the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything.
sd	And since we go there all the time, I mean
sd	probably at all.
sd	by the way, may name's Julie.
fp	Hi.
sd	I'm from Atlanta.
ba	Neat.
sd	I just think that everybody ought to do it.
sd	The only thing I know that you can recycle is milk jugs.
b	Yeah.
sd	but I used to just save up the ones that I got one time and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over.
sd	and I'm not sure if Kroger does or not
sd	Can bring them in.
aa^r	I know it.
sv	It really is a small, hostile planet .
qy	Did you know that, like, something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is like paper? Filled with paper.
sd	Well, it is, though.
sd	It is, because they,
sd	like yellow paper, you know takes something like twenty times as long to decompose.
sd	it will still be there in a couple of weeks.
sd	You'll be able to read off of it.
b	Yeah,
sd	they treat it, too.
ad	Maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again.
no	Maybe.
ny	Yeah.
sv	well, I mean, I think we've kind of, you know,
sv	I mean, everybody everybody has a computer.
sv	We would no longer need paper at all.
fp	Hello.
fp	I live in Texas.
qy	do you also?
bk	Okay.
qy^t	you ready to begin?
b	Okay.
ny	Yes.
sd	I believe, if I, am in a position, like when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care that I will be able to just bring her into my home and my father also, or have someone go into their home, you know and look them.
sd	That way.
sv	it's more how they feel about it.
sd	And it is like they feel, the way my mother would put it like somebody had thrown them away . You know?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I use to work in one of the offices in a nursing home
sd	and I got to see a lot of the things that they did
sd	they had a lot of crafts 
sd	some of the people that are in there are you know, very nice and friendly to everybody
sd	and they just you know want to go in and do what they have to do and get out go home.
sv	the attitude of the staff as you said is really very very important.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	and and they would enjoy enjoy themselves with activities
sd	and they they just didn't like participate together with the others because they had some, I guess, slight mental disabilities and things like that.
qw	what do you call Alzheimer disease and stuff like that
sd	and don't, they weren't really together with the rest of them, when they got together for such activities.
qo	How do you feel about the Viet Nam war?
sd	I saw that as well.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Well, were you ever in Viet Nam
sd	I was born in sixty seven,
sd	but neither of them wound up going over, which, I think they were very happy for.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Well, so well do you feel that it was worth what we did over there?
aa	Okay.
qy	I mean, do you think, the investment in lives and money was worth it?
qw	what effects do you think it's had on our country?
b	Uh huh.
sd	it was such a gradual and subtle, you know you know increasement of force that.
na	I vaguely remember we had a, we had a, spy ship torpedoed or something.
b	Oh .
qy	so, do, do you think that like, for example like in this past war, in the Persian Gulf war that you see, it seemed to me that Bush was going to extraordinary lengths to, you know, prepare the country for war.
aa	Okay.
fc	good bye.
sd	apparently, you know, they haven't, executed anybody since nineteen sixty seven, I believe.
sd	Well, we were, we just started, we lived in Redwood City when we were out there.
sv	but I think the appeal process is really getting in the way.
qy	do you feel as though there should be, was or more, you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by, capital punishment?
b	Uh huh.
sv	So, I, I mean as man has gotten more complicated so all of the, imaginations to, you know, protect him from being, dumped on by, civilian authority in so , in criminal actions, especially, you know, murder cases and that sort of thing.
b	Uh huh.
o	Okay.
sd	we do it more when we have company come.
qo	what about you?
qw	where, about is that?
sd	I've been to Cafe Pacific.
aa	Right.
ny	Yes.
sd	and we all ate there
sd	and, their seafood was wonderful.
qw	Now where is the Atlantic Cafe?
bk	okay.
sd^e	but I've heard that's really good, too,
b	Oh.
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
bf	You know right away what you want .
sd	my in laws also enjoy prime rib, when they've had some of their specials on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday night
sd	and, the time we went the prime rib was really good.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah .
sd	I've heard about that, too
sd	I guess we eat out even less than I realize .
b	Oh .
sd	I had heard that, too.
qy	Have you been to the little, not for prime rib but the Cafe De France, right here on Central Expressway? * slash error okay. / * slash error should be bk
ny	Yes,
sd	but, during the week they often have, a limited menu choice but, very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety nine that included the soup or salad entrees and accompaniments and dessert
sd	my husband and I like veal, a lot
sd	We've tried different ones when they've had them as one of the
aa	Uh huh.
ar	no,
b	Right.
sd	down near the Highway Twelve area, is Gershwin's,
qy^d	I don't know if you tried
aa	Yes!
ny@	yes * Shouldn't this end in a slash? it had a sponge cake * I really think this should be the start of a new slash unit. and whip cream
sd	and it had strawberries, kiwis, and raspberries in a raspberry, puree
sd	and, and we shared one, the three of us
sd	but, I wished I'd had a camera.
sd	It was beautiful .
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
ba	It sounds wonderful.
sd	they must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer's Market, you can't find them like that
b	Uh huh.
sv	but the atmosphere and service I think, are important, too.
b	Yeah.
sd	They do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three.
sd^t	discussion on child care.
nd	they're all grown up.
sv	well, you know all about it then.
sd	I have grandchildren but, haven't really been into selecting child care for them,
sd	And it's been quite a few years since I've had to think about that.
sd	my daughter that has three stays home with her children,
sd	but an aunt keeps the baby.
sd	but I would imagine it's very hard.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	well, that's good.
qh	What if you had a fire or something with babies?
sv	you know, you'd have to be able to get them all out.
b	Uh huh.
sd(^q)	But I was thinking, my gosh, if they had very many babies, they couldn't possibly get them all out.
bf	But you could put them in one of these cribs and then roll the crib out I guess.
ba	well, that's neat.
qrr	or is it just a job for them?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	how old are the children go with this center where you work?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	You've got the little bitty ones.
sv	Those are the, probably the best group to have.
sv	And they're fun.
sv	and they're not quite big enough to be getting into everything yet,
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you think there's very many really good day care centers around your area?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Sometimes it's a have to.
^q	I wish I could find someplace I really felt good about. You know?
sd	Most of them don't really feel that it's a great place to leave their kids.
^q	and we just now found her.
sd	They had left her on the bus closed up all afternoon.
^q	if they'll take a group of kids to the zoo or somewhere and then come back and not even count them and realize they're one short.
sd	But one of the teachers happened to walk by and see her pounding on the window trying to get out of the bus.
sd	And this was four hours later, you know.
qh	what do you do?
qo	How do you feel about credit cards?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
ba	Wow.
b	Right.
sd	I think it was like twenty something cents interest, on our Visa.
sd	But we don't like to do that at all.
sd	and I think we have a couple of department stores.
sd	But, we use it the same way,
b	Uh huh.
sd	That's usually how we do it.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	but, I guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it, like that, that may be good.
b	Yeah.
b^r	right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow .
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah
sd	from the Dallas area.
bh	really.
qy	Do you work for T I?
bh	Well, really.
qy^d	I wonder how T I got G T E involved.
bk	okay.
bk	okay.
b^r	yeah.
sv	your speech is very exact.
bh	really.
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah.
sd^e	I work in .
ny	Yeah.
sv^t	so I think we're okay.
fc	Well, you too.
fc	Same here.
ba	that's great.
qy	Have you ever been there?
sv	that's a perfect age for Disneyworld.
sd	I, I don't work.
sd	and in the position he's in, they don't care if I go along.
sd	and Disneyworld is the one for a week next year
sd	and this year matter of fact we're leaving next Saturday for New Orleans.
qy	have you ever been there?
sd	because it wasn't a tremendous amount of things to do. That I wanted to do there.
sd	and they do have a Mardi Gras night planned.
qy	Did you know that next week there's several T V shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary.
sd	she's old enough to really grasp the meaning behind,
sv	so, well, if you're working, then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go.
sd(^q)^t	when I heard my topic today, I thought, okay that's my favorite
sd	and, it has just worked out really well with this, position he's in. Because I can go at a spur of the moment or what have you
sd	and it depends where he's going whether or not I decide to go along
sd	I don't mind the pool life at all during the day.
sd	and I love to shop.
aa	That's right,
sd	Well, and one of my very favorite is Las Vegas.
sd	I would have to say we both end up going to Las Vegas, probably once every maybe year and a half.
sd	And presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles
sd	because we have a lot of flying with Continental
sd	and they're recommending that you use those because they don't know the future of Continental.
^q	we better start using them.
sd	when we normally go that way, we like to go to California at the same time, because we really don't get out there as often as you could probably from Texas.
sv	I think that's a good trip.
sv	And really, for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent.
sd	and we went through the northern route and through Utah and as far west as Las Vegas
sd	and then we returned through, New Mexico that you just mentioned.
sd	And it was it was just great.
sv	and, unless you do something like that, you're going to get sick.
sd	But if it gets longer than that I, i , it, I start not doing anything.
sv	you obviously are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it.
sd	I mean I started doing this when I was about thirty five
sd	and now I'm fifty five.
sd	I need to lose fifty pounds, you know.
qy	have you ever done anything at all?
b	Uh huh.
qw	what club are you with?
qw^r	What club were you with?
bf	So you're down, you're downtown.
bf	You're down there on, you know, twentieth and eighteenth and F G.
sd	But generally, you know, I can get in and get a program, you know.
sd	I mean, I've been doing this for fifteen, twenty years.
sd	and so I really don't want to, you know, back off on it.
sv	and you can recover.
sv	but, I feel that it's pretty good if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs.
sd	but I think our latest statistic said something like ninety nine point nine eight percent were, testing negative on all the dru , on all the testing.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	and then you're called like six months after you complete the program
sd	and if you test positive, then you're terminated.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, of course they can also cause injury to other people.
sd	if they're not, you know, fully functional mentally while they're doing their job. They could cause you know, serious injury to another people.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
sd	they say, runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it.
sd^e	it's very expensive.
sd	It's not like a normal urinalysis
sd	because, nobody in our company got a raise.
sd	But, yet they spend all the money on drug testing
sd	that, I think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a yes, sir, we should have drug testing because there's really a problem
sd	But then, I have other views to it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	from what I understanding here at T I, they run close to a thousand dollars an employee.
b	Uh huh.
o	Okay.
sd	Mostly freshwater,
sd	so I don't fish too much in saltwater.
ba	neat,
bh	really.
qw	What'd you do with them?
qy^d	You didn't get a big kick out of killing them like some people do?
qy	and there's no limit.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That looks awful tiring .
qy	Did you.
qy^d	Didn't like it?
sd	It's a rhythm or something .
^g	right .
qrr	or do you eat what you fish.
b	Right.
b	Right.
qy^g	You just like to sit down and watch it, right.
b	Really.
b	Right.
ba	That's nice.
sd	Well, most of my fishing is done at, area lakes around here, freshwater lakes
sd	It's a fairly new lake in Texas.
^q	I was out there for a reason .
b	Really.
bf	Everybody but you.
bf	Couldn't catch one to save your life.
bf	just hoping maybe, he could pull .
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sv	That would be fun.
bf	Hand picked .
sd	We were in, Rockport, which is close to Corpus
sd	so it can't be a fish.
sd	it was brown with these little white dots
sd	and it made a loud, almost a croaking noise like a croaker does
sd	To this day I don't want to get in the water, anywhere around salt water because I'm sure one of those fish are there.
b	Uh huh.
ng	I've never heard of that one.
bf	That's where it gets its name, obviously,
b	Uh huh.
qy	Can you eat them?
sd	I don't think I'd want to even if you could if they're that ugly,
sd	it scared me to death.
sd	it really, it didn't look like, it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died.
b	Oh.
qw	so what basketball teams are you interested in?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
sv	they're more of a football team than they are basketball team.
b	Yeah.
sd	I don't think I've ever seen them nationally on basketball.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That's not too bad.
b	Uh huh.
sd	So, I do pull for Chicago.
sv	I mean, of course, this year is a good year to be a Chicago fan, I guess, because they're doing pretty good.
ny^r	yeah.
sd	so, so, I finally am feeling better about myself as far as college teams. Although, I've really, you know,
sd	again being from Saint Louis, I pull for Missouri.
sv	so you can't do much about that.
sd^e	I watched every, I watched all three games of that.
sd	so it was real nice to have the teams that were there.
sd	but, I was real happy to see them get knocked off.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	they play the pro style, is, what I've always called it.
b^m	the fast breaks and,
sd	but they weren't ahead as much as they normally are.
sd	and they've not had to do that all year
sv	I mean Duke's schedule was so much harder than U N L V's that it just made them a much tougher team overall,
sv	and, that had to help them a lot.
b	Uh huh.
qy	So do I take it that you think though that the Lakers will, will win
sv	I mean, Portland's pretty good.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	he's more of a, a real tall forward .
sv	I think Magic does a,
aa	yeah.
aa	That sure is.
sv	I think that's going to be one of those that's won by the home team, you know,
sv	whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one I think.
sd	Detroit's in that, that same, division.
sd	but as I heard, Isaiah came back this week.
sv	So, that might help them.
b	yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	yeah but he's been, yeah, but he's been kind of up and down all year.
sv	and then the next time he'll, you know, he can't seem to hit the side of a barn.
h	So, I don't know,
sd	I'm kind of, I'm not sure about him this year.
sv	Well that's when, you do it.
b	Yeah.
b^m	Well, the dark horses,
sv	Well, anybody who has David Robinson, has got to have a chance anyway.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's true.
sv	so, they don't have to worry about that.
sd	but I, read that,
sd	maybe I misunderstood what they meant.
b	Well, yeah
sv	you never know.
b	Yeah
b	Yeah.
aa	That's what I think.
b	Yeah .
qy^g	It's coming up, isn't it.
na^r	Portland.
b	Uh huh.
sv	So, it ought to be a real interesting play off.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^2	When it's on the line.
b	Uh huh.
aa	that's true.
fc	Well, it's been nice talking to you.
fc	Take care.
sd	and I made some, candle sconces that you hang on the ...
sd	I don't know if it's the saw dust or the mess you make or the smell of the wood
qw	What are some of your things you like to do?
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sv	it's a good time for gardening.
sd	but I think the temperature has been pretty good so far for working outside.
qy	Do you find you do most of your, crocheting or your knit work around Christmas time?
b	Yeah.
sd	She enjoys doing it during the cold weather because she's always got something to cover her legs and feet with while she is working on it.
sv	So, those things they take some time to make.
bf	Well, that's kind of like quilting.
b^m	Mile a Minute.
qy^g	I guess that is your standard knitting, isn't it?
sd	I know,
bk	okay.
bf	Instead of call waiting or call anything else.
sv	Well, I guess that's one way to end a conversation.
qy	have you started your garden yet?
ba	boy.
sv	always got to have those.
sd	but always got to the keep those planted.
sd	Well, that's kind of the way I am,
sd	It seems like all I got was,
sd(^q)	Mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon. You know,
sd	but I hadn't looked at a farmers almanac to find out when a good time for zucchini is.
am^r	it may not be.
qy	You think they're later in the year?
sd	Most of the okra that is growing around higher is, later okra.
sd	Well that's about,
ad	Go ahead.
ft	and thanks for participating.
fc	have a good time.
sd	I drive a Honda Prelude.
b	yeah .
sd	so I'm not buying a car any time soon.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I like where all the controls are they're, they're in good spots
sd@	and I have an automatic I can't drive a standard. / * Why weren't the 2 indep clauses split up into separate slash units?
ny	Yeah.
sd	the only thing I've ever heard about Hondas is that the breaks go out first.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I had a Buick Regal.
ny	Yeah.
sd	and it, was still going strong.
sd	The only problems I had with it in the nine years that I owned it, I had to replace the compressor when it was about seven years old.
sd	I had like little piddly things like I had to replace the muffler
sd	But I never had any major anything, other than the compressor.
aa	Huh uh.
sd	so I don't drive one a lot.
sd	So, I don't feel comfortable in traffic with it.
sd	And for everything I've heard it's a lot easier to sell an automatic.
sd	And, and resale value is really important to me .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	but, it still looked real nice,
sd	there wasn't cracks all over the dash board and stuff.
sd	So I ended up okay with the Buick,
sd	of course, I may never sell it ,
sd	I may drive it until it's dead
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
sd	So, I went to a dealership because they had like, the same year and same model, of Prelude on their used car lot
sd	and, you know, I just fell in love, with this brand new white Prelude, you know, two liter S I with the sun roof and the moon roof
sd	and I, bought it loaded.
sd	The oth , the two, other things that I bought on impulse are a V C R and a washer , and dryer.
sd	I go for the big stuff.
b	Oh.
sd	I got, I got my Buick as a high school graduation gift.
sd	and I was just scared to.
sd	I was scared to start taking on payments because the Buick was long since paid for.
br^r	wha , ar , you, buy a used car?
na	Sure.
b	Yeah.
sd	and you can have them checked out by mechanics and stuff.
sd	I mean they can't stop you from doing it.
aa	Yeah.
sv	Well, and even if they didn't, you can still get a good idea if you can get a good mechanic to, check it over real carefully and check the block and everything.
fc	Well, I enjoyed talking to you.
fc	Bye bye.
qy	Do you have smog like they do in California?
b	Uh huh.
sv	It depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion, I take it.
b	Yeah.
qw	What do you think is your primary cause of it.
qy	You really think cars contribute a lot now that they've taken lead out of gas?
b	Uh huh.
ba	my goodness.
sv	I don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting, uh, frankly.
sd	something to the effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent, or, take all the cars off the road that have been, uh, manufactured say before nineteen seventy five, that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining.
sd	that is, not, not total but just from cars,
sd	and I don't have an incentive to get rid of it as long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money.
sv	On the other hand I know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars I have.
sd	But I don't have any incentive to get out of it until it dies.
sv	And, uh, that may be part of the problem.
sv	I, I we, we seem to have a high, uh, cancer rate up here in Maryland.
ny	Yeah,
sv	but I just can't believe it is.
sd	They use freon twenty two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps,
sv	and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer.
sv	and having all kinds of effects,
sd	I know DuPont and Dow and several other chemical companies are working, uh, feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons,
sd	Because if they ever come up with a reasonable working agent in place of fluorocarbons, then, uh,
sd	but they made them take it out of that.
na	Right.
sd^e	they, they, they passed a law and made them take the fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers,
sd	but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces, uh, you know, containers in,
sd	and she spot checks people's trash.
sd	And if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your trash, they'll fine you fifty bucks I think the first time and two fifty the second time.
sd	They've stopped that up here too.
sd	for instance cans and bottles, they never go away at all.
sd	I'm not sure of that.
sv	I, I really think that, uh, trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very, very important thing.
sv	That's for sure.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Oh good.
sd	because we have to go down, uh, once a year here in Maryland and get out car's exhaust systems checked for emission content.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but any time you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state.
sd	But in this state we have to, uh, pay eight dollars and a half and go to a, an emission station once a year and get every one of our cars checked that are, have been made starting in nineteen seventy three.
sv	in Virginia they check that every two years, I think.
sv	And that's, that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants.
sv	and if they don't then that's something I would certainly, uh, uh, suggest you be willing to uh, uh, be for in terms of, uh,
b^r	yeah.
sd	I've worried, especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like.
sd	I know a lot more people are going to bottled water.
b^m	tap,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I forget what you call those things,
sd	I mean, I can still to this day taste that water.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Oh, I bet it was.
sd	cause I went through the public, um, school system of Boston,
sd	and I still didn't even I, I couldn't put together a map of the United State.
qy	You know what I mean.
sd	an I, couldn't do it.
sv	I just felt like there were some real basics that are missing from education,
sv	and the people are, are leaving school not even knowing some common sense things.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qr	um, did you do through a public school system or private?
qy	did you notice a big difference?
qo	Like in what sense?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	an they're people that come in, you know, every day to fill out an application,
sd	yet when it comes to even answering the questions on a simple application, they can't read enough to be able to fill out the answers by themselves,
sv	it's just incredible.
b	Really.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think it's, um, some place in New York because they're having budget problems, they're closing the libraries.
sd	I mean they're not getting rid of any of the sports, or anything like that,
sv	That to me shows a little, uh, switch in priorities.
qy	So do you go to college right now?
qy^d	You're a, so you're a senior now.
ba	Oh, good for you.
qy	um, is, is N C University is that, uh, State,
br	What did you say?
qy^d	that's a State University then.
qy^d	And you're from there also?
bk	I see.
sv	Well, pretty soon it's going to get to the point where no one is going to be able to afford to send their kids to college or to do go to college.
sv	It's just a outrageously expensive.
qy	Oh is it.
sv	I mean, you know, thousands of dollars,
ba	Oh, well, that's good.
sv	and I, I think that I probably would have done it differently if I, um, you know, could do it over again.
sv	and that's probably a pretty sad thing to say
h	I don't know,
br	what?
sd	I went to Brandice University.
sd	And, um, I really felt like I've been working now for about four years,
sv	and I, I feel like what I've learned working is a hundred times more valuable then what learned in school.
sd	and one thing she's trying to instill in kids, um, besides just reading and writing are just some, the golden rules,
sd	Like no hitting, you know,
sv	I think they don't value that type of student as much as you get, in some.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I mean personally I would get more satisfaction out of taking someone that wasn't as successful.
sv	And seeing what they could do verses somebody that did excel in, in areas and just watching them get better, you know.
sv	That's not much of a challenge.
qy	But ar , do you have any ideal what you're going into when you graduate.
bh	Oh yeah.
qy	Do you know where you're going?
qw	Where's that?
qy	Oh is that North Carolina?
bk	Oh, okay.
sd^e	I don't know that area.
ng	I just don't know it.
sd	I don't get down there very often.
sd	well the way I pick the final four was, um, by the state that had the warmest climate.
qy^d	so obviously you're into education.
sd	my husband went to, is in graduate school actually right now.
sd	I, I couldn't wait to graduate and have, it be all over.
aa	I know.
fc	Good luck.
fc	take care.
qw	What kind, h ,
sd	Right now we, I've got a, uh, four year old Subaru and a two year old Honda.
b	Oh, goodness.
bh	Really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I bet.
ba^r	I bet.
b	Yep.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	these are the first cars that my husband and I have ever purchased ourselves.
sd	The others were hand me downs through the families.
sd	And those were always G M cars.
sd	Uh, Buicks and Chevrolets.
sd	but all the ones that we ever had were the, you know, eight cylinder,
sd	really rugged, G M cars.
sd	and we both drive, well, forty five miles round trip every day.
sd	And so we wanted a smaller car,
sv	and quite frankly, we were afraid of the, of the G M small cars.
sd	You know, as far as durability.
sd	when we had our larger cars, we didn't mind, uh, keeping them up,
sd	you know, doing the maintenance and everything on them as long as we didn't have to do it very often.
sd	it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for them .
aa	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's like a yacht.
sd	we, we sold or we, we traded in our Le Sabre for our Subaru.
sv	it was a great car.
sd	we ran the wheels right off of it.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Um.
ba	I bet .
aa	No.
sv	I wouldn't want to have to pay for the gas, either.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd^e	Uh, we're, our, our, we won't have any more licensed drivers for about thirteen years.
sd	Both of our cars are getting, oh, around sixty thousand miles on them.
sd	We drive a lot.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^m	A pickup {faint}.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think that would be a good idea.
sd(^q)	I've, we've, we've, we've kind of been the types that will say, this is what we intend to spend,
^q	will you sell me this car for that price.
sd(^q)	and we're were just, like, okay fine, we, we won't then.
sd(^q)	I mean he's like, no, no, no.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
ba	Goodness.
aa	That's right.
qo	Um, so what do you think?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
bh	Oh, really?
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
sv	and I'm sure they can get a lot cheaper because they, they, hospitals buy in such a bulk rate, um
sv	And I don't think that is, that is, uh, abnormal in any means to be doing things like that.
sv	I don't think it's abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all .
sv	I, I think the fact that malpractice has gone up I think has raised our prices just dramatically. Um, in the, in the last number of years
qo	What do you think about it?
sd	I worked with Spanish people for about two years
sv	and just, it was incredible to me to see the things that they had to go through when they were really some of the best workers.
b	Right.
aa	exactly.
sv	I think, you know, I think in a lot of ways the law is good because it tries to, to protect, you know, the people who are in the states.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Oh, you're kidding.
sv	it's amazing to me how, how many things they would allow to occur before, you know, you can come in.
sv	it's kind of frustrating, too, for those who are legitimate now.
b	Uh huh.
sv	because really they're the ones who work the hardest and do the jobs that, that we don't want to do.
sv	I think, that, you know, if someone wants to come in and they can prove that they're going to work and they're going to be a good citizen that we shouldn't close our door.
sv	And, you know, I, I believe that if someone goes on welfare that's when, you, you know, send them back to their country.
sv	And, I think a lot of times we're so busy trying to keep them out that we're spending twice as much money as we would just allowing them in
sd	and just basically what they do is they get caught when they wanted to go home for Christmas. Or for any other time.
sv	but, but there could be some work done in the area.
qy	Anyway, do you have anything else in the, the subject, uh that you might want to talk about?
sv	because if you, if you have connections, it's a lot easier to get in.
sv	and I think, you know, it should be more of a thing that's based upon someone's intent, you know. And that it should be equal to all
sv	it d , it doesn't become a thing of who you know, but, but how the type of person you are.
sv	And it should be based on those kinds of things so the good people, like probably your husband, can get in .
ba	Well, great.
sd	and I've learned something from it.
fc	You have a good evening, all right?
fc	bye bye.
sv	but it makes it really convenient cause I keep a rather hectic schedule
sv	but the newspaper p , provides a little bit of depth that you can't really get from,
b	Right.
sv	my only major objection is that, uh, I don't think American media spends enough, uh, attention on, on our closest neighbors like Mexico and Canada.
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean the most they'll give it is the back of the A section.
b	Uh huh.
aa	definitely.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	There's some serious talk about whether there's actually going to be a, a Canada, you know, in the next five years. You know, because of the problems with Quebec
sd	and n , I had never heard any of that before.
ny	Uh huh.
b^r	right.
b	Oh, yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I used to.
sv	I think everybody took piano lessons
qy	Do you?
sd	and I played it for maybe three months .
ba	Wow .
b	All right .
b	Yeah.
aa	True .
sd	Only for about three months.
sd	and we got pretty bored quick .
sd	Um, well, I could play, uh, the wood chuck song.
sd	And I still can to this date.
sd	and for three months .
sd^e	any time I got bored .
nn	No.
sv	but I think everybody can.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you sing at choir at your church?
b	Yeah.
sd	So, I never tried again.
b	Yeah,
sd	and that's about when I quit.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	parents always do.
sv	They're nice that way.
qy^d	so you listen to kind of church music, gospel?
bh	Oh, yeah?
b^m	Yeah.
b	Oh, yeah.
bf	the jeezer music as I call it.
aa	Yeah.
sd	and that's his station, so I call it the jeezer music.
sd	Well, I listen to like ninety seven point one, you know, more,
sd	kind of pop, you know, rock.
aa	Yeah.
ar	Well, not hard .
br	Huh?
ny	Yeah.
sv	It's not too hard,
sv	But it's not enough to put you to sleep .
sv	Which some of the songs on K V I L can.
qy^d	got the bumper sticker, too?
^2	Someday.
fc	Okay.
fc	Okay.
fc	Bye bye.
qy	You interested in woodworking?
qw	What kind of
qy^2	pine?
qy^d	I guess he's young.
sv	he'll be delighted.
qr	or do you have powered, you know,
sd	Our local schools have adult education in the evening
sd	I'm an artist.
sd	and, you know, if I touch it, it turns into something us , usually.
o@	* slash error well actually, I'm very, you know, / * slash error
sd	once I get you know, really pretty good at something, I want to try something else .
sd(^q)	you made it.
sd(^q)	so let's do something else.
sd	I'm signed up for a class in pottery making because I've never tried that yet
sd	and it's in art education.
sd	but jobs being what they are, I substitute teach
sd	I don't know how long that's going to last .
sd	but I've been real interested in some of those cute country kind of things.
sd	and I make it.
sd	I love to cook.
sd	And I saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas and, and knife and a fork and all kinds of stuff
sd	and you get the tools you don't feel like buying.
sd	but it didn't,
sd	but if it cost me twenty dollars, you know,
sd	It was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I got two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon.
sd	and cutting that wedge out was no joke .
sd	I had a, I did it through Adult Ed again.
sd^r	I did it through Adult Ed again.
^q	that was the plan here .
sd	So we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of a cradle for it.
sd	but there's no coping saw big enough for a fourteen inch wide watermelon that
^q	it's not going to happen.
sd	by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about .
ng	I'd say it's about an eighth.
sd	And then, just recently, after we were married, I baby sat for a dentist while she worked.
qy	Is it? {Very faint}.
sd	The expense.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and that wasn't counting food or gas or anything.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
ba	Oh, wow.
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think people that treat their baby sitters like that get a lot better baby sitters.
sd	And I quit , you know.
sd	I was just like but I'm wasting my time.
sd	but I thought ...
aa^r	Yeah,
^q	But I don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat .
^2	Eat this or .
sv	So, I can see the concerns on what different people want.
sv	I mean, you know, if I was setting up a daycare, there would be so many needs you would have to customize your service to.
sv	Cause some parents won't put up anything. Where others would.
b	Uh huh.
ar	No.
sv	There's too many lawsuits.
sv	I just, I think it's a bigger risk than ...
aa	Yeah.
sv	and they just want to sue you.
b	Oh, yeah.
sv	That's impossible.
sd	And then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in, you know.
sd	Like they'll be in the same clothes they were the day before, the same diaper.
sv	I mean, you just don't know.
b	Yeah.
h	I don't know.
sd	Just not knowing.
sv	and, uh, there's crime in, uh, young people because they don't have ro , role models
qo	What do you think?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Okay.
b	Yeah.
^2	From anybody else.
b	Yeah.
aa	I think I can agree with that too.
sd	I don't know how you do that.
sd	Or both of them.
sd	Now, to put the blame on the parent.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Um.
b	I understand.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
qy^d	Anything do any about adult crime.
sv	Well, for one, a major problem with that is the jails are overcrowded.
b	Um.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sv	I mean seriously,
sv	they ought to put those people to work.
b	Yeah.
b	Um.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
nd	Well.
sv	they, you still have to punish them.
b^r	Yeah,
sv	whereas some of them are so far gone that they can't do anything good for society.
sv	that's true.
sv	I don't think so either.
b	Yeah.
sv	And they keep taking more money from us
sv	and they don't have any incentive to work if we're just going to take fifty percent of it.
sd	then they don't have to pay taxes on it .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Um.
b	Yeah.
sd	I'm not counting on it.
b	Yeah.
b	Um.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina.
qw	Well, where are you from?
bk	Okay.
ba	Oh, man.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	Ow.
^2	Why did they do in the freezer?
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean, not not too often real bad ones,
sv	I don't think there's anywhere where there isn't going to be crimes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Um.
sv	He's probably a drug dealer himself .
sv	You never know.
ba	Wow.
b	Um.
b^r	Um.
bf	Time to go.
b	Yeah.
sv	It's pretty nice.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Most of them are too scared to do anything about it.
fc	Well listen, I got to go.
fc	Nice talking to you.
fc	All right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh, I see.
sv	Well, that's nice comfortable stuff.
ba	Wow.
sv	That's nice.
ng	so my dress code is very, very .
sd	But over the summers I've had a job, internships with the newspaper.
sv	but you still have to have a professional imagine kind of thing. To go out to meet people and interview people and stuff like that
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	That must be nice atmosphere then.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
sv	It's like a mini, little study there .
ba	That's really interesting.
ba	That's interesting.
b	Uh huh.
ba^r	that's neat .
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	That's good for the clothes budget, I would imagine.
aa	Yes .
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	two or three.
sd	because of, we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child because they had a gun in the house
sd	it destroyed two families in just that instant
sd	I don't know if you're in the big city,
br^m	Dallas?
sv	That's a big city .
sd	and he's going to, you know, try to shoot first.
sd	if he's got a knife or whatever that can throw it at you,
sd	I still won't have a gun in the house because he said it's really , playing Russian Roulette if you do .
aa^r	That's right.
b	Right.
aa	That's right.
b	Right.
aa	That's right.
aa	I know .
b	No.
aa	That, That's, that's right,
aa^r	that's right.
b	Right.
sd	They, you know, they say there should be no ban,
sv	but I can't see why any, o , on the street citizen should be able to be allowed to have a machine gun.
sd	I don't know too many people that use a machine gun to go sport hunting either .
sv	That, to me, would not be an unreasonable thing.
sd	course the argument with the people in the gun club, is that, well the people that are going to get guns are the ones that are going to steal them anyway.
sv	Course, some of them do.
sv	So it, it is a hard question .
aa	oh, yeah.
aa	That's right.
fc	well thanks for talking.
sv	and I think that comes about from their being a definite factor in the job market now.
sd	and, I was in one of those safe occupations.
sd	I was a school teacher,
sd	and we had one child when I taught for my two year career.
sd	and I stayed home with those children, and raised those children
sd	and now that my husband has retired, I am back substitute teaching,
sv	and some days you wonder why you're even bothering,
sv	because your fighting for your life.
sv	I think they're going in by choice.
sv	And I think too many of the young professional wives in our small town of five thousand, uh, are not letting that happen.
sv	They are very aggressive.
sv	They're, uh, they almost have what I would call a killer e , killer bee instinct.
sv	And, and I th , I think they lose a lot by what I call neutering their husbands.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh, sure .
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and the only value I see coming out of, this is that children now in, in a two parent home, they now actually have two parents,
sd	and I have a daughter, who's a beautician.
sd	And I see, my sons in law cooking and, dropping children off at the sitter and, picking children up from school and, and having a much better relationship with their children, than my husband ever did
sd	because he, left home at five thirty in the morning,
sd	and he got home at six fifteen.
sd	and he was asleep in his chair because he was exhausted.
sv	and I think, that's an advantage.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	And I think it's a, a wonderful advantage for the young, for the, for the, particularly for the males, for the little boys to have, a relationship with their father,
sv	and, and I don't, think you, we get into so much of the mother dominating figure, if, if the father has more input there.
sd	And we just recently finished a long drive through the west, a little over five thousand miles,
sd	but I sat at a counter to have a cup of coffee that happened to be for truck drivers only.
sd	and she w , has just, had just driven a load of meat from Minneapolis to some place in Arizona,
sd	and she had been driving, a truck for seven years.
sv	I mean, why would a woman choose that rough and tumble life style when,
sd	but after she talks to her husband about how she ought to vote.
sd	Now it probably doesn't work that way in our household because I have strong opinions about things, too,
sd	I like my luggage, carried and, my door opened,
sv	and I think that's sad.
sd	He was raised in the south,
sv	I think that's a little war condition, .
b	Huh.
aa	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
sd	I'm not altogether sure that that's my best topic.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sv	I, I think that the last, part of that question was particularly interesting, about, or how much unethical behavior can be made illegal because it seems to me that when , government or public service of any kind degenerates so much that you have to have so many explicit ethical codes parallel to the legal codes that, we're focusing on the wrong thing.
sv	Maybe so many things have become public with the media over the past, you know, ten to twenty years that, it becomes more evident.
sv	Perhaps things that we didn't think of before and just concentrated on the lawmaking or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or, you know, et cetera like that
sv	and we were just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons.
sv	And I couldn't help thinking when that last quest , it was a funny question when that last part of the question came about how many things can we, actually put a legal code on how much, should it be our, prerogative to see into the private lives of these people. You know.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sv	I, I agree with that and also that if the results that they're putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by legitimate means is what's, you know, going to the public then they'll pay for their private life in their own private conscience.
sv	And, you kn , when it becomes public, though, it becomes scandalous.
sv	things that you don't know do, do not worm their way around and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray.
sv	but, as soon as things do get public there is that terrible concern.
sd	So, sometimes I ask myself, what are, people doing that are in the media when somebody, you know, comes up to office,
sv	it seems that one of the first thing that's done is to dig up any kind of a thing they can on them and get it all over the headlines.
sv	It's a very low way of living.
sd	and, and, and as far as, you know, myself having any particular personal, knowledge or insight into politics or politicians, I'm not terribly involved in it.
sd	Just in a very cursory way.
sd	but, I, i , it just is not one of the things that I have, placed, a lot of my particular time and effort into,
sd	so, I always feel very outside this kind of an issue.
b	right.
sv	and they certainly do get inside information
sv	and, of course, the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing, the more you can trust their judgment and their insight.
sd	I just kind of read and kind of be aware
sd	and then, I don't like to make a whole lot of, judgment myself unless things are so absolutely out of whack that,
sd	I guess the next car I'll be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door .
sd	and then, uh, our, our newer car is a, uh, a Corsica.
sd	And we'll probably be looking for something about that, uh, that same style.
sd	That same kind of four door, hard top style.
sd^e	but we're planning for it.
sd	but it's in pretty good sh , in really good shape.
sd	And we've been really pleased with Oldsmobiles.
sd	So that's probably where the first place we'd look.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That'll do it.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Oh, geez.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
b	Uh huh.
ba	Oh, geez.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Sounds like you, you need at least like a Taurus size, or something like that.
sd	That I guess it's the sports version of the Taurus?
sd	and, uh, and a lot of those.
sd	And it comes with a bigger engine and the things like that.
sv	You're not going to see too many, uh, you know, green ones or blue ones or anything like that.
sv	They, they put them in sporty colors I guess.
sv(^q)	and then you go, What?
qh	What would I, besides tooling around and looking really cool and having a lot of fun, what would I really do with this car?
sd	I had an old car that I bought just to get to, to my j , my first job.
sd	And when I got there, the first thing I did was trade it in on a Spitfire.
sd	And I, I knew that was going to be the only time I could afford a two seater, uh, sports car.
sd	I bought a set of stereo speakers
sd	And it was winter, so I was in like this coat with the top down,
sd	and the speaker in the passenger seat.
sv	And da , you kind of outgrow that real quick when it's your only car.
b	Yeah.
bh	Oh, really?
b	Yeah.
sv	Boy, that's a good deal.
sd	Well, I'll have to remember that if I ever get in that situation again .
sv	she really doesn't want to learn I guess, the, uh, the standard shift.
sd	We got one of these things from Lee Iacocca that said, you know, I'll give you a fifty dollar savings bond if you'll test drive a car.
sd	But it was one of those things where we just went to a big parking lot
sd	it was a Le Baron with everything on it,
sv	It was the craziest thing I ever saw.
sv	And, and, and that's probably why they were trying to sell them, I guess.
sd	She did pretty well after a while.
sv	But, uh, it's just kind of hard to learn, I guess.
b	Uh huh.
b	Um, okay.
ba	Oh, geez.
sd	Well, I guess that's, I guess that's about all I've got to say, about cars .
b	Uh huh.
bf	because it's so big.
b	Oh, yeah.
b^r	sure.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sv	but I bet on the next time you buy a car, that's going to be mandatory.
sv	You've got to have that now.
sv	and you got to have it.
aa	That's true too.
fc	you have a good evening.
fc	Bye bye.
o	Night,
sd	I understand we're supposed to talk about spaceflight.
sd	I hope you know more about it than I do.
qy	is that right?
sv	I was so upset with TEXAS that I haven't gotten into any more of his books because I thought it was just horrible.
sv	so I wasn't sure how credible he was.
qo	But anyway, what do you think we've gained from the spaceflights?
sv	Ego trip.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qw	Where do you live?
qy	am I talking to Utah right now?
ba	great.
sd	Because I'm in Dallas.
qy^d	Carolyn Rash?
qy	Is her name Rash, Carolyn Rash?
b	I see.
sd	I hadn't heard that.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
aa	I would think so, too .
qy^g	You never think about that do you?
sv	I would think it would be harder to get up than it would be getting back down.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I'm sure you've seen more of them than I have,
sd	but you could see the scorch on them, you know,
sv	but you could see how hot it got because it was still the scorch on them which was quite interesting.
b	yeah.
sd	Well, these were the ones that John Glenn went up in you know, and the old, old ones.
sd	the little bell type things.
sd	they really were,
sv	and, yeah, I mean, you actually put it on , you know.
qy	but did he go into that in the book?
sv	I guess that's just to sell us on it.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Well, that's true
sv	Because I think those satellites, you know, or not satellites, but the spaceflights could really spy
sv	and with, with Russia's demise, I didn't know if we should continue to support it at the current level.
b	Yeah.
sd^r	I don't either.
sd	A, Golden Retriever.
bh	Is it really?
sd	let's see, he just had his fourth birthday.
sd	we like him.
sv	He'd probably look pretty funny if we did that.
sd	and he's up to ninety four now.
sd	He's kind of stocky, shorter and stockier.
sd	We treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten.
sv	Get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids .
qo	How about you?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	have you ever had a Retriever before?
sv	They love to play with kids.
sd	and he doesn't like it if we tie him outside.
sd	he'll just bark and bark and bark.
sd	and, she is good friends with my dog.
sd	So he's pretty good about taking to commands and and things.
sd	and, this is the first dog I've had all my own as an adult.
sd	I never really to hit him or anything.
sd	Just, you know firm tone of voice and those sorts of things.
sd	and those horrible collars that they put on them with invisible fencing,
qy	have you heard of that?
sd	it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little, transducers or emitters in your yard at the perimeter
sd	and if they get too close to that perimeter, it it zaps them.
b	Yeah .
sd	He said it was a good jolt.
sv	If you put enough patience into,
qr	is your cat an indoor cat or an outdoor cat?
sd	Somebody just told me that
qy^d	because of the leukemia?
bf	Quite a difference.
qw	what kind of climate do you have?
sd	the last development I know of was the military and financial assistance Columbia for the, for the drug, uh, control.
sd	And, the source of supply.
sv	but the source of supply is there.
sd	I've been to, uh, Peru several times.
sv*	but there is not exactly a lot of, uh, physical responsibility there. / * listen; probably 'fiscal' not 'physical'
sv	but they need to learn how to stand on their own, own two feet also.
aa	I know,
sv	but until you've seen some of those, uh, native, Latin Americans come down from the hills, you can't imagine what poor is.
sd	And, uh, the worst scene I've ever had I think was, uh, someone eating out of, out of a garbage can on the streets in Lima, Peru.
aa^r	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
sv	the, the graft and the, uh, payoffs down there are , are an accepted way
sd(^q)	and he pot, patted his pocket and said fifteen percent,
sd(^q)	And the Ambassador potted, patted his pocket and said one hundred percent
sv	it's a sad story
sv	but it, uh, it is a problem.
b	Uh huh.
b	Um.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, the oth , the other instance I think of their inability to, to handle things, the cholera, and hepatitis epidemics now in, in Latin America.
sv	And it shows the, the unpreparedness for such, such a problem.
sd	And they're very rich in gold and silver, and very rich in, in, uh, natural resources such as the fish and, uh timber, and, and copper and all types of, uh, resources
sv	they don't have the ability to develop it.
aa	Right.
aa	You're you're exactly right.
sd	because they offer assistance, then don't get repaid.
sv	Of course it's a very volatile government, uh, situation, too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And it would save the U S money in in the long run in how much they're trying to do,
aa	True.
sv	And, I, I think finding an alternate to that would be very good.
^2	Argentine beef,
qy	Well, have we come up with a solution yet, Salina?
sd	Well, one of these days, uh, I hope we'll find some, some way to substitute the good crops for illegal ones.
aa	I agree.
fc	it has.
fc	Very good .
ft	thank you Salina.
qo	what's your opinion on the, our policy down there?
sv	I didn't know we had one either .
sd	military action in Panama is the only thing that comes to my mind right now,
b	Right.
sv^m	We didn't do anything.
sv	that is, that is pretty, uh, risky.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sv	He takes more risks.
aa	He was.
sv	But, you know, if we, we back up what we s , what we say with actions.
sd	I don't know, how long it's going to last.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, I don't think it's possible because, even though, you know, we're against them, I don't think we can go into another country and do something about the other country's problem.
sv	But, to go in and take out the whole drug kingdom would be something totally different because,
b	Right.
sd^e	I didn't.
br	Oh, the drug problem?
b^m	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	so they're going to have to go to the source.
b	Right.
sv	That's true.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh.
sv	Depends on how much power you have, and who you know.
b	Yeah.
aa	Probably.
b	Huh.
sd	I don't drink Scotch.
sv	We, don't want to piss them off and have them over produce
o@	and then, because then our economy would be pretty bad. Yeah.
sd	you know, the same old cliche.
b	Right.
sv	and it'll all, be for nothing.
fc	Appreciate talking, to you.
qw	what was that book that you were saying to read, again?
b^m	A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER.
bk	All right.
ft	Thanks a lot.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	and, uh we had a lot before Christmas.
nn^e	but no, uh, no snow.
sd	The snows all melted off mount, uh,
sd	and they're down between thirty eight and, uh, forty inches.
sv	and it's getting quite serious, as far as water next summer.
b	Right.
b	Um.
sd	and we read in the newspaper, southern part of Texas I guess flooded out,
ba	Oh, boy.
ba	Oh, my gosh.
sd	there's quite a wash that goes down, uh, through Plano
sd	but, uh, that was clear full and up to, up to some of the streets, I guess.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That's funny that, uh, we can't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much.
sv	but I imagine if it's that cold in Dallas it,
qy^g	It's not a, doesn't get that cold, I guess, huh?
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes.
b	Yes.
sd	I hope we can get, uh, get some.
sd	and they're not predicting any for the next, uh, week anyway up here
b	Yeah,
sd	we got a high pressure system which has been sitting in the air
sd	and, uh, we broke the record for the amount of fog that we've had, uh, you know
sd	and then they seed the clouds, or seed the fog to try to to get the airplanes in and out.
qo	So what do you think about caring for older folks Dale?
b	Uh huh.
aa	very definitely.
b	Uh huh.
sd	My mamma is a dialysis patient
sd	and, but she's also a very, very, very independent person and doesn't like having having people, uh, not being able to do things for herself when she wants to
sd	He's ninety, I think right on ninety right now
sd	My grand mamma died a couple of years ago
sv	as long as you can have the families take care of the people, I'd like to see them stay at home.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	especially for your uncle I bet.
qy	Do they have anything like that in Dallas.
bf	So they are pretty limited.
sd	another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology wa , well had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had them, sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives. To make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities.
sv	I don't think that was mainly with Alzheimer's patients, but just patients, people in general who were not as independent as they use to be.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	to, uh, get there and to participate in the activities.
aa^r	Right.
bf	You can't play those things.
sv	But you can sing songs and, uh and tell stories about the old times.
qy	was it your grand mother that was having Alzheimer uh, being able to tell old stories.
sv	You can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with Alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way.
qy	Do they like to listen to other people recollect though?
b	Right.
b^m	Okay .
sd^e	for the last, uh, couple of months.
b	Yeah.
sd	We just bought, uh, a car, uh, last year and then bought one in eighty nine
sd	We've got three cars, of all things.
sd	So, uh, probably we'll be in at least a midsize, four door sedan.
sd	Uh, we have a, a Mazda nine twenty nine and a Ford Crown Victoria and a little two seater C R X.
sd	we'd, look, always look into, uh, consumer reports to see what kind of, uh, report, or, uh, repair records that the various cars have
sd	and then, of course, we look into the prices.
sd	Uh, I traded off an eighty two Oldsmobile for the eighty nine Mazda.
sd	and, uh, we, we've had a good many foreign cars.
sd	We've been extremely pleased with our Mazdas.
ny	Yeah.
sd	and then we had this eighty two.
sd	So we, we really can't complain about Oldsmobiles, really.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the Mazdas.
sd	Was British gr , racing green, with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top.
sd	And, uh, I drove it mostly.
sd	and we got transferred to Okinawa.
sd	W , which really tore me up .
sd	and we got a little Fiat, uh, and a, and the little, uh, forty horse power Mazda, four door sedan.
sd	and one is twenty five.
sd	And they, they still live at home.
sd	Actually the, they're both going on their own most of the time.
sd	So, uh, most of our activities are, you know, just discussion type things about what's going on in the family and what they're doing and that kind of thing.
aa	Sure it does.
b	Oh, yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	is the one year old a boy?
b^m	A girl?
sd	And the, and the younger one is a boy,
sd	but, of course, uh, Richardson is in the Dallas area.
sv	that, you can't let them grow up the way, the way I grew up, you know.
sd	And I could, you know, go and do whatever, pretty much whatever I wanted to do, uh, my whole life.
sd	Uh, you know, I never, never had to worry about the bad guys being out there.
sv	that it's, it's really a sad commentary on, uh, you know, a life in general,
sv	that, uh, you know that children can't, cannot be allowed to grow up, uh, you know, without really close supervision.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	A lot more available, of course.
sv	I, I would probably have a hard time getting through school myself.
sv	or at least it would be a lot harder than it was when I went to school.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh,
b	yeah,
b	{Very faint} Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	I can't imagine th , them having as much fun as the parents, had watching them .
bf	The, the disorganized play really what it was,
sd	I guess he was probably five or six, you know, when he first started playing soccer.
sv	And, uh, and that was, that was more fun to watch those boys trying to, trying to kick the ball up and down the field.
sv	I guess, that was, you know, as important, uh, as much important to the parents as it was to the children that, uh, you know, to get out and watch the kids play,
sv	The, the students have a little too much, uh, too much leeway.
sv	but when they're in school they, they don't have quite, quite as much control, over them as, uh, as what I would liked to have seen.
sv	Uh, uh, I kind of feel like there's, there's too much allowed to go on in at, at school.
sv	And, uh, you know, it tends to, uh, to encourage students to not be as, you know, to not concentrate as much on the education.
sv	You know, they're, they're there for a good time.
sv	And, you know, to, to see how little they can get by with.
b	Right.
sv	it carried over, into, you know, individual rights
sd	so I can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me you know, that I think's like is an invasion of my privacy, stuff like that.
sv	But I think it'd be, it is kind of a tough topic.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd(^q)	You're like, No, you don't, no.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	now, I mean, now there's, I heard that they were going to start calling on Saturdays or some ,
sd	I would be so mad .
bh	Really.
b	Huh.
qw	How?
bh	Really?
sv	I think's like privacy is like, just like, not going through my stuff, like going through, just like my clothes or my drawer, just going through my stuff, basically.
sd	That drives me up a wall.
sd^e	see, we're not,
sd	because she can't wear like my pants
sd	but she'll take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff.
sd	Man, I'm just glad she can't wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses, you know.
^q	So I prefer that you just not go in and get them
sv	like that's an invasion of my privacy, I feel like.
sd	when you have your door closed, people just walking in and stuff like that.
sd	she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy, is like going through her purse, like if you ever needed money and stuff
sd	and she'll get it out or whatever.
sd	I was thinking that's the only thing I could really think of that would really be.
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
bf(^q)	get out of my cabinets.
ba	That's great.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	That would drive, that would, that ,
bh	Really.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	Then you start missing stuff,
sv	and you know how it looks and everything.
sd	That would bother me, definitely.
b	Uh huh.
ny	yeah.
sd	That's the only thing I can really think about being an invasion of privacy, like something every day, though.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Oh, really?
b	Uh huh.
ad	Uh, go ahead.
sd	I have a friend who is working with, uh, who works with, uh, travel groups,
sd	and one of the ones that he's w , worked with was professionals who came in for an AIDS, uh, conference in, uh, California.
sd	He's a translator.
sv	And they're letting, the information out slowly about how, you know, how big it is.
sv	I don't know that spending more always gets it.
bf	You mean more money for that means less for cancer or,
b	Y , yeah.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie.
sv	Uh, that's a good point.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and I'm with you that I don't know is, is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more.
qh	Did they know that all along?
b	Oh
b	Right. .
qw	And how is it really transmitted, et cetera.
sv	I think they, they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say, you know.
sd	but, but that isn't how it was in Africa.
sd(^q)	This was an international, conference where people are saying, well, but in my country it's, you know, like this.
qh	And does that mean like flus and everything else, there are all these different strains of it?
sv	Uh, or maybe they understand but,
sv	If you, if I were dying, I'm not sure I would care.
sd	I'll take anything you know.
sv	I mean if I'm dying, if I know I'm dying, you can experiment on me.
ad	Go ahead.
aa	Exactly.
sv	and that is the effects of acid rain. Com , coming basically from coal plants in Ohio and Illinois and Indiana.
sd	Every once in a while we have these air inversions, the weather inversions
sd	and we're having problems now because the fish are dying and certain acidic loving plants, uh, or alkaline liking plants are j , not lasting anymore because the soil levels, the p H is changing as this acid rain continues to fall.
sd	it wasn't really pollution, just the steamy weather .
b	Yeah
sd	Uh, just this, it looked like billions of cars massing
sv	because when I was in Los Angeles for a time, it's all, you know, from Los Angeles to San Diego it's like all city.
sd	but if you have nowhere to do anything.
sd	but, you know, up here we have Kodak
sv	It keeps the neighborhoods happy I guess.
sv	but that's really getting under control now.
sv	Well, sometimes, strangely enough, one vote has made the difference.
sd	because in the local elections is the ones that have the most influence on their day to day lives.
sv	Well, maybe part of the problem is they don't, they think they have enough choices.
sd	and then lot of more voters come out to vote than vote in this country.
sv	Well, maybe it's a matter of, you know, voter awareness.
sv	In this country, it seems like it's a continuous ongoing campaign.
sv	or they don't have the money.
sv	People aren't going to vote for someone they've never heard of.
sv	And even debates don't seem to help much.
bf	So we're really voting for the best makeup person and the best handlers.
sv	Well, that was certainly a media event.
sv	Well, he had a classic case of hoof in mouth disease.
sv	Which is good, you know.
qy	Do they have children?
ba	Oh, that's wonderful .
ba	Oh, that's neat.
sd	I like to see that.
sv	and I think it's neat.
sv	which the organization can use the help too.
sd	So, I, I wish I could see more of that, you know.
b	Oh.
sv	those are neat cats, too.
sd	but they're all mongrels .
sd	Well they're the ones that need the homes.
sd	and I can't turn a hungry cat down.
sd	and he was just laying on my lawn just shivering and all,
sd	We don't have very many activities
qy	Is she spayed.
sv	real maternal .
sd	of whose, whose top dog, we , top cat, I guess.
sd	and they've slapped the dogs around too .
sd	Every now and then,
sv	As long as you make her feel, uh, like she's still loved and everything,
ba	Oh my gosh .
bf	Three hundred and fifty dollars {whispers}.
sv	house payment .
sv	That is a lot of money.
sd	if they start going in the front and stuff, I bring them in.
sd	and too they can catch diseases really easy,
sd	just by touching a nose to another cat they can contac , leukemia, feline leukemia,
sd	We know we try, try real hard to keep them healthy.
ba	Oh, how neat.
qh	I mean, why not.
qh^r	why not.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	You're off of the main road, you said?
sv	and it's, it's just real tough on animals here, you know.
sd	it makes me sick,
sv	but anyway, we kind of got off the subject of children,
sd	except that I consider them my children .
aa	Yeah.
^2	In, in her little bridesmaid dress .
sd	Well they have weddings for dogs now and cats
sd	I've seen it in magazines and stuff where you dress your animals up and take them to a par ,
sd	I'm not that bonkers.
sd	You know, my cats do not wear clothes,
aa	No.
qrr	or do they just all have young kids.
qy^g	she needed that, didn't she.
sv	I think I would be extremely jealous, or would have been, had there been another child in the family.
sv	it must be tough.
qy^d	We , she, she's the middle one?
sv	so she really doesn't even know what it is to be the only one.
sd	uh, this is the type of, uh, switch where you flip the, the lever, the turn signal on the column
sv	which is even worse than them just not getting bright .
sd	it's not in the switch, because it does the same thing with the new switch.
sd	although it's been removed from the box it's obviously not been really used.
sd	Uh, I had done what diagnosis I could, primarily by looking at a wiring diagram that I did have of the car and, uh, pretty much decided that that had to be the problem.
sv	It, it, the other switch could be the main switch itself, uh, that turns the lights on or off, which is on the dashboard
sv	uh, it might be tied into the equation somehow,
sd	I don't remember seeing one in the, uh, in the diagram
sd	so I'll have to go back and look at that.
b	Uh huh.
sv	that's a good idea.
sd	and I hope that that's the case this time.
sd	it's out of Kansas somewhere.
sd	so I'll have to try to return that as well.
sd	but it's over like in the Brook Hollow industrial district down on Stemmons and Inwood area
sd	instead of, uh, all import cars, he has narrowed it down to where he only works on, uh, German cars and {pause} German cars .
sd	I just, however, did, uh, have to get a, a, uh, one of these jam box portable dual cassette players, uh, repaired.
sd	but I had to take it in,
sd	uh, but it didn't do me any good, because I had, I had missed the window by about a week or two.
sd	But, uh, that's really my only experience in the past year where I've had to take a product back because of a defect.
ba	Good grief.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
ba	My goodness.
b	Huh.
ad^t	so why don't you go ahead and start.
ny	Yes, sir.
aa	exactly.
sd	I've had to have oil changes done myself because I live in an apartment complex, where we are not allowed to, work on our vehicle.
sd	We can't even wash our vehicle,
sd	I had a sixty six Mustang,
sd	and that was all right because like you said that was pre technology days, I guess.
sd	but my main concern and what I enjoy doing was the interior.
sd	It was taking you know, the whole interior apart and, you know, ordering new carpeting and,
na	Right.
sd	We sanded down the insides of the door panels. And painted, those and,
sd^e	I sold it.
sd	and I was surprised at, the availability of parts yet.
sd	Canada.
sd	You know, prefabs and all that stuff
nd	Well, actually there was.
sd	And, I had heard rumors that it was because they couldn't duplicate certain patterns, exactly.
sd	And so like the glove box was just a little, little wider, little harder to fit in,
sd	and the carpeting, stretched a little too far.
sd	I had to cut some of the sides down.
sd	The fourth one you couldn't get to lineup no matter what you did.
sd	and, it runs. It works just the same,
sd	I know you got, certain spring lever that you got to have or some, some spring pulley or something that you got to pull that spring back over onto that notch.
sd	and I helped him when I was growing up,
sd	but I don't have that stuff now,
sd	because of the drum brakes I, you know, don't have any choice but to take them in.
b	Sure.
sd	You didn't have to worry about finding a metric anything.
qo	Well, what kind of music do you like?
b	Yeah.
sd	I mostly like classical and jazz.
sd^e	I play the trumpet.
sd^e	Mostly the trumpet music baroque and, , Romantic.
sd	Baroque and romantic.
sd	but the rest of them are just parts .
b	Yeah.
qw	Who are the trumpet players?
b	Uh huh.
^2	Leonard .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
^g	didn't he?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh .
no	Well, that is mostly the rest of good trumpet marks are romantic music, Mahler and Ruckner and Strauss .
na	I am liking it more and more now.
sd	They are mostly Mozart.
sd	but, you know, I just like the melodies more and, libretto.
sd^e	I like Rossini better than Puccini.
sd	I like more comic licks.
nn	No.
sd	only the Fort Worth Opera .
sd	And my trumpet teacher used to play in the Fort Worth Opera.
sd	John Nelson.
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	he plays in the Fort Worth Symphony and Fort Worth mostly.
aa^r	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Which Church is it?
sv	It seems like a lot of Churches are hiring more musicians now than they use to.
ny	Yeah.
^g	isn't he?
b	yeah.
sd	because I heard Glen Bell taught at Plano as well.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g^t	They're talking about, federal government, aren't they?
b	Yeah.
sd	and then they go and spend that money somewhere else
sd	and that's why the budget is never balanced.
sv	and they spend it somewhere else
sv	or you know, they pad out their staff, or, you know, spend it in bounced checks at the, commissary,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I think they should limit the Senate to one six year term.
sv	and, keep Congress to, two terms of two years a piece
sv	and they won't have the same people there all the time
sv	and then, all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all of their their payoffs and kickbacks
sv	and that'll keep them busy enough so that they won't have as much influence.
sd	The air bag came out, what, twenty years ago.
sd	And only now they're getting that put in cars.
sv	and then the government doesn't jump on them hard enough to make them do anything.
sv	It should have been done immediately.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	They listen to wherever the money is.
ba	that's for sure.
sd^t	They suggested that we, discuss what we think of when we say camping.
sd	Camping or, motor home is nice, travel trailer, pop up,
bf	You really rough it then.
qy	Do you do that very often?
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	You'd have a lot of hills down in that area.
b^m	Yeah.
sv	That would be really great.
br	Pardon?
qr	Did you go alone or with a group or,
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's great. Long as it's not raining.
b	Really,
sd	Well, I'm in Pennsylvania.
ny	Yes .
qy	Are you in Texas, now?
bk	Okay.
sd	but, we're up here in northwestern part of Pennsylvania.
sd	and we had access to a motor home which is really super great, if you don't want to rough it too much.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, we really enjoyed that.
br	Huh?
qy	Is that better?
bk	Oh.
sv	If you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping then it can be kind of bad.
b	Uh huh.
qw	What kind?
sv	Those aren't too pleasant.
sv	You probably have more there, though, I would imagine.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	But you still backpacked and camped out.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	I guess you know enough to look where you're walking or sitting or whatever you're doing.
qy^d	I would think a cave could have problems like that, too.
qy	is your brother younger than you
bf	You have a lot good experiences from that.
qy	What, black ones?
sv	That would be exciting.
sd	They're on the increase in this area.
ny	Uh huh.
qy^h	The black bear.
ny^m	yeah.
sd	they've had longer hunting seasons than that even to get rid of more of them, because they were, increasing so much.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I must say that, we really have a lot of fun, a lot of memories in that from camping
sv	so, it's a lot of work, too
fc	and I hope you get back into camping again, and do a little more of it.
fc	and you have a good day.
fc	Bye bye.
fp	how you doing?
qy^d	you're right here,
sd	I just, called and came in.
qy	Do you work at T I?
sd^t	and I thought, I better make some calls.
sd	Well, I haven't got a chance to look at them yet.
sd^t	She's talked to two students.
ad^t	we're supposed to talk about the elderly now, I guess,
sd	She's not in a nursing home.
qy^t	didn't we push?
sd^t	I'll hit it again just in case.
sd	But, she's she's down in San Antonio
sd	It's at, Trinity,
sd	and they have a retirement home for the nuns
sd	and they take some lay people.
sd	they do have a wing where the people who are really sick, you know have nurses.
sd	I mean it's just super.
sd	She just went in last year.
sd	she, she's perfectly healthy.
sd	and she just did not want to take care of the house
sd	and so she's happy as heck,
sd	and they serve meals, of course.
sd	Now I know the ones where you're really ill, we visited a long time ago when she had a grandmother that was in one.
sd	And they were all more or less hospitalized type you know, really, really sick.
sv	It's a tough question.
sd	you got more experience than I do then on it.
aa^r	yeah.
sv	that would be awful.
sd	I never thought about that, you know.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and they're getting nicer.
sv	and boy that really pumps them up.
sv	I think that's one of the sad things, is when you're in an older home.
sv	If you just have people your own age, you never get a chance to see kids or anything or animals or anything, you know
sv	kind of obvious you can't take care of children or animals in a nursing home,
sv	but it's nice to have them visit and everything.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	She's just about seventy five. Again, perfectly fine.
sd	she's much more alive and, active when she's been on a visit with somebody else, you know
sd	and our routine has obviously hectic with teenagers and everything
sv	and so the stimulation part is really important. I think, like any animal, anything
sv	you just lay around, that's the fastest way to die, I think, you know.
b	yeah.
sv^r	it's sad,
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	} living with them.
sd	And I think, whether it's more a custom up there, or maybe because I was younger
sv	I guess that, well, we aren't getting away from that, which is not right.
b	yeah.
b^r	right.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
ba	Well, that's nice in a lot of ways.
qy^d	Bet you were surprised that you said that by mistake.
sd(^q)	I think, Well, my kids better not do that to me.
sd(^q)	So I think of it, Well, how would I want to be treated rather than, well,
sd	I don't want to be
^q	but I'm not going to one of those places.
aa	yeah.
sv	that's the way we call it, which is really wrong.
sd	I mean it's a little hotel, you might say.
sd	She has two bedrooms, and a separate living area.
sd	They don't have kitchens or anything
sd	but it's like on each floor they have a little kitchen area where you can go down and have a make a meal, you know.
sd	I mean she's totally on her own.
sd	and we keep thinking about that, you know
sd	and they don't even understand what happened, you know.
aa	I know.
qy	he still drives?
qy^d	but I don't know if you can afford the insurance,
b	Yeah.
sv	I mean, people are all different.
sv	I wonder if they should give them a test, or at least maybe give them a refresher driving course, just to see how well they are every five years.
qy	Are they doing it?
b	Yeah.
sv	and I don't know why you couldn't after sixty five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving.
sv	the insurance companies would, would probably help pay for some of that, you know.
ba	there's a good point
fp	Hi.
sv	and it's become to a point where basically no one can afford it anymore.
qo	How do you feel about the whole ordeal?
b	Uh huh.
bk	Okay.
b	yeah.
qrr	or do you think that,
sv	and the in , the people that can afford taxes, the middle income and the upper income will be paying more taxes to pay for health insurance for everyone, whereas right now the public themselves get health insurance
sv	and they provide their own health insurance.
ar	I kind of disagree .
sv	I guess it's my fear of the national government and also because the bureaucratic rules that it would take to administer it
sv	But in the same sense the care and the attitude of the doctors and the professionals within the medical, field would diminish.
qy	Are you ready?
qy^t	She didn't announce that to you?
sv	I think, that's pleasurable for all of us, if we choose the right restaurant .
qw	So, what are your thoughts on dining out?
qy^d	Not for the price?
bk	Okay.
bk	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	it's like mama in the back kitchen, huh?
bk	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
qw	And where was that at, near your,
qy	is it in Dallas?
qy	Is it in the phone book?
qy	Do you know how to spell it?
bk	Okay.
bk	Okay.
b^r	uh huh.
qy	Do you have a preference if you were going to, eat a fast food?
sd	See I don't like Arby's.
^q	thank you.
sd	Well, that's not what I heard, from somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
sv	Unless somebody is trying to blackball them.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Okay.
qy^g	but it's probably not advertised as such, is it?
sd^e	Health food, restaurants that,
aa	Well well, like, well, I can't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there's so few and far between.
sd	And they have very good food over there.
sd	They do you know, list the fat,
aa^r	uh huh.
sv	which is kind of high for lunch I guess.
ny	Yes.
ny	uh huh.
sd	but, you were served by maitre d's and, men waiters.
sv	Well, I guess if you were trying to impress somebody like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant. It's a special occasion, type thing.
sv	And now the Red Lobster I found is very nice at lunchtime.
sv	you can't beat that price, if you went to a cafeteria.
sd	and it was exce ,
sd	it was,
sd	And I haven't gotten over that from the north.
sd	I know they say that, that is,
sd	but I'm, but they've got all these caution signs now on fish
sd	and so I kind of stay a ,
sv	Because of all the pollution in the lakes and the, everywhere. I mean there isn't any safe haven anymore for fish.
sd(^q)	and especially, in Wisconsin and Michigan they say, no, buying of our fish.
sv	and the best brand of chicken to buy is the, Pilgrim Pride because they don't use all these hormones to remote , unnatural growth in their products.
sv	So I mean, we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy.
^2	Corrode.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good.
ba	dear.
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah.
sv	Everything, everything we eat should have a label on it .
b	Yeah.
ad	You want to get a start?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	your, your growing Summer starts a lot earlier than ours.
sd	We could still have a frost.
ny	Uh huh.
sd^e	But we have had a frost as late as in June.
sd	It is almost like an early Summer for us.
sd	We could use a little more rain, I believe.
b	Uh huh.
sv	If it could just be spread out a little bit.
sd	the weather they forecast for our area seems to go right past us and misses us. Just by, well not too many miles.
ny	uh huh.
sd	but we are not a farming person .
sd	we have a garden.
sd	but we are not farmers.
b	Uh huh.
sv	They get burnt off.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Their farmers, I guess, are hurting because of that also.
qh	so what do you do?
b^m	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and it makes a bit of a difference, too.
sd	I could be wrong.
sd	It had a different feel to it.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know my brother's home has been flooded a couple of times,
sd	but it is more run off from surrounding, you know, areas and that.
sd	And, he is just in an area where it is just low enough that you know, it, it collects there.
sd	And, he has had a couple of inches in his house several times.
b	Uh huh.
sd	or, we are on a, where we are we get flooded, it floods below us , behind us.
sd	But we are high enough that we never, you know, have had any problem like that.
sd	and, we really like it here.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I, I liked it when we visited there.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	but it is hot to me in the wintertime down there.
sv	it is really a nice area.
b	Oh.
sd	I avoid the sun .
sd	And I try to cover up when I do the lawn .
sd	and, I decided it is not worth it.
sv	And, we are just crazy .
b	Uh huh.
bh	Is that right?
sv	It, it just makes your skin more leathery.
sd	They say it destroys a lot of that.
sd	And you lose a lot of that.
sd	We have really had really good weather of late.
sd	and, it has just been a really nice Spring.
qw	How long will they be there?
sd	Well, I hope the weather stays real good for them. And, and, that you have a good visit and everything.
fc	Well, it was really nice talking to you.
fc	So I hope you enjoy it as much as I have been enjoying it .
fc	and I forget to make a call usually.
fc^r	great.
fc^m	Okay.
fc	Bye bye.
sv	 so I guess, you know, being that I come from a hunting family I'd rather have some restrictions put on weapons but yet allow hunting rifles, things that people would use for sporting type of, a, activity.
sv	we need to put restrictions on them .
b	Uh huh.
aa	sure.
sv	To do massive amounts of killing,
sv	The only thing that I can see is the police having it in a case where somebody is, you know, going to kill a massive amount of people or, somebody that's escaping, that's, very dangerous
sv	semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch the person and, get him down.
sd	they're very much into sporting you know, as far as hunting and also like, clay pigeons things like that.
sv	but I figured if the criminals had to take a hunting gun out to kill somebody, more than likely, somebody would see it, you know what I'm saying versus you know, a small handgun, that can be, you know, put right in your coat pocket
sv	but yet, you can't stop people from having, you know, a handgun in their home.
sv(^q)	Even if there are small children around, there's, you know, you can't say people with small children can't have guns
sv	and people without small children that may have grandchildren, you know still have these guns
sd	but I guess I was always taught, number one, a gun isn't a toy.
sd(^q)	you know, and I don't know if that makes a difference if the parent sets down to them and say this gun can kill you, you know and don't ever play with it.
sd	so I don't know if that makes a difference or what
sv	The criminals would get them. I mean even if they had to go across border to get them.
^2	How you know, to make sure the guns are put up as something as not a toy.
sd	Because we had guns all over our house when we were kids
sd	and not that they were laying on the, couch or anything like that
sd	but, I never had an interest in them, being in the fact that I knew that guns could kill
sd	and I had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns
sd	and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasn't a toy
sd	and we went through, the National Rifle, Club
^q	and you're going to learn how to have safeguards and and know how to protect yourself
sv	they have to have a certain respect for it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah.
qw	how's the weather been in Plano? .
sv	this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city.
sd	and I'm ready for it to come back.
sd	and today I know when I got up that the temperature said more like, close, seventy nine or eighty
sd	so I'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather.
qy	You don't
qy	are you a summer person?
bh	Are you?
sd	and they have more of the four seasons.
bf	you're used to that, too.
sv	and the problem here in Plano is it doesn't last very long.
sv	and then it's cold
sd	and I wish it were several months of that.
sd	But if you have to get up and get out in it, I don't like it either .
sv	That kind of schedule, you really need a lot more sunshine.
sd	And also the evenings are going to be getting, darker sooner as it gets cooler.
sv	Sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler.
sd	They had to get the squeejies and clean them off.
sd	the humidity, especially for curly heads like me.
sd^e	I do not like the humid , .
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know our grass needs mowing twice as often when it rains
sv	It seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern, that's all it does.
sd	I guess my best would be probably sixty eight when you wake up or sixty six, and then probably seventy five during the day.
qy	do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds.
b^r	yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	keep it there .
b	Yeah.
sv	But then we started thinking, especially in Plano, the weather is so hot in August, that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow.
sd^c	Static here.
sv	I think a lot of people agree the same.
aa^r	uh huh.
sd	In fact this morning when they were talking about, Harold Taft, they were talking about how this has been one of the milder of the summers and milder fall,
sv	well those are the ones that like the cold weather.
sv	It was it was really a shame.
sv	He didn't go with all the gimmicks that some of them did.
bk	Okay.
ba	good.
fc	well, then have a good day.
fc	And I hope you enjoy the weather this week.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	They set that up for you.
b	Uh huh.
qo	And, what kind of running do you do?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	is just aerobics
sd	I mean the running.
qy	you do a mile in about eight minutes or less?
qy	then you don't get, out of breath.
bk	Oh.
qy^d	But, I mean it's not pushing it real hard, like, you know, if you tried to make six or something like that.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I did when I was in school.
sd	Right now I just lift, weights and do push ups and sit ups
sd	and I, jump rope a little bit
sd	and that is about it .
sd	they are about a third of my body weight.
sd	and the, the more upper body strength, the easier it is to play.
sd	and then, I hurt my neck, about three years ago.
sd	So, you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from, hurting yourself when you play high.
sd	but a lot of people, strain themselves doing it.
na	I play at Church.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh .
sd^e	well the weather is nice except for when it rains, you know I mean in Dallas.
sd	I mostly jump rope more.
b	You know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I do a toe lift and squats for that.
sv	But you know it doesn't, doesn't, accustom your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you are running for a long time.
sv	They tend to tighten up whenever you have to do something at, great length of time.
sv	And it also builds too much mass if you just, you know.
sd	So, I, I lift weights with about the same curl weight as I do the squats with.
sd	And, then it doesn't bother me very much.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd(^q)	and then I add sets to it so that I don't like you said, wear it out.
sd	I don't try to push it so the end in one set.
sd	all set.
sd	well, I play a couple of instruments.
sd	I try to.
sd	and I also play a little bit of saxophone, flute and piano when I get the opportunity, which isn't very often.
qo	How about yourself?
b	Uh huh.
ba	wow.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	So are you a professional musician?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	We generally have a concert every other week
ny	Yeah .
sd^e	we sure don't.
sd	and every single Sunday night we play at the library to have a little outdoor stage set up
sd	and so we do that every Sunday night during the summer,
sd	and we're just having to turn a lot of people down, because, you know, we don't want to do things like have a concert back to back or even two days in a row.
sd	and you just flip through it, and that sort of thing.
no	It really depends on who shows up.
sd	because so many people switch instruments so often.
sd	in the winter we do more concert stuff
sd	I think there's about seventy.
sd	there's a lot.
sd	But, on any given night there's not seventy you know,
sd	it alternates quite a lot.
aa	it really is.
b	Yeah,
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
ba	that's fun.
sd	Someone at work is trying to get me to join that one, because they need clarinet players
sd	I think they're like Monday nights and they don't have rehearsals during that time period.
sd	but some people are,
sd	some of them are.
nd	Well, they're in the suburbs of Dallas, in Richardson and Plano.
sd	We're real close to Dallas.
b	Yeah.
sd	well, I think it's very much more of a social group than anything else, you know.
sd	and people always bring refreshments for after rehearsal and hang around for an hour or so
sv	and, That's probably why we get so many people.
sd	we do get some money from the city because we do play at a lot of city events.
sd	I think he's the only one that gets paid.
ny	uh huh.
sd	it's a similar thing.
sd	but the same type of thing.
sd	we can borrow music from any of the area colleges
sd	or, you know, if some group just isn't going to play any more, they'll just give us their music, and that type of thing.
sd	but we get a lot of donations.
b	Yeah .
o	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	well see, I'm the third oldest of twelve children.
sd	My youngest sister is five.
sd	and we haven't discussed this at all .
sd	like if we do watch T V at night, they just like enjoy just, like laying on top of me or something.
sd	and we like to play like kick ball and softball and stuff.
sd	that's it, you know.
sd^e	we go and watch.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean, they'd be in the audience screaming and yelling, you know,
sd	and they're not really even participating.
aa	Uh huh.
sd^e	the one down thing about having that many people in our family is we really don't have any privacy when we're at home, because you couldn't possibly have a house with twelve bedrooms.
sd	and I like to spend time with them.
nd	We were all pretty close when we were younger.
sd^e	now that we're getting older, you know, each one of us are going our own direction.
b	Uh huh.
sd	we couldn't go outside because of the snow and stuff
sd	like we try hurtling our couches and stuff. You know, and.
sd^e	we would just run and jump over the couches.
sd	So we could like play hide and go seek in our house and even stuff like that.
sd	Like, my sister that's closest to me, we're only fourteen months apart.
sd	So there was never just one alone, you know.
sd	So we were all pretty close where we always had a buddy to play with, you know.
sd^e	not at all.
sd^e^r	Not at all .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm Catholic .
b	Uh huh.
sd^e^r	Not at all.
sd	but to me five wasn't even a lot, because I was just so used to twelve.
b	You know.
sv	it would be really hard now to have twelve children.
sd	Well, Well, okay, well like my oldest brother, he's twenty four,
sd	but she works you know,
sd	and I think she even gives mom and dad a little bit, you know, of rent money.
sd	So, it's kind of like they don't, you know.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've always had my own checking account since I was in like tenth grade.
sd	and there's a lot of kids up here that would have no idea how to even do a checkbook or, you know, to manage money.
sd	Like my roommate's laughing you know, at me, you know, because their schooling's paid for.
aa	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	So when we all graduated college, from high school, we all got,
sd	and then I pay for my own life insurance too.
sd	And then And then, like, my mom and dad, because there's so many of us, and because of the way the laws are, you know, now, if we want to drive, we have to pay for our own insurance on our cars.
h	You know, I don't know.
sd	So you know, if we want to drive, we pay our own insurance,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you, do any woodworking?
qy	for a hobby or for,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
nd	My husband cuts them out
sd	but, he likes using the little band saws and jig saws more than the stroll saw, because the stroll saw is a lot slower
sd	but now he wants a plunge router.
sd	and then I took a tole painting class to learn how to paint them right, you know.
sd	And what we want to do is, you know, make them, and then maybe take them to these craft shows or flea market things and see if we can sell some of them.
sd	But, I really like it so far.
sd	And then my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood
sd	and then it's just a wooden doll with a painted face
sd	and you stick in like rope and tie ribbons around it.
sd	So I've got a couple of those started.
sd	but as far as wood work, that's all we've been doing right now.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qrr	or you just given them to them on consignment or something?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	these little things are so cute, though, you know.
sd	I went through some of the books down here at the craft shop, you know
sd	In fact, I just sent to Shop Smith back in Ohio for a rocking horse pattern.
sd	we, well, Gene's got one of those too .
ny	Yeah,
sd	well, he's retired now
sd	but I'm still looking for a part time job, you know.
sd	But, he has all day long that he can, you know, work on this stuff and do do cut outs like that, you know.
sd	And he's got a lot of tools,
sd	But, these little wooden things, they seem to sell really good.
sd	My next door neighbor, every time she sees something, she thinks it's so cute she wants to buy it, you know .
sd	So, I'm just hoping you know, that we can get some cut out and painted, you know, before summer starts because we don't want to have garage sales or anything like that in the winter time, you know.
sd	it seems like they go real good, you know.
sd	and I live out in the valley
sd	and country seems to be the in thing out here you know,
sd	So anything that looks like it might be country is what they want, you know.
ny	Yeah.
sd	it's going to have little wooden hearts holding it, in its hands and then welcome written on those little wooden hearts.
sd	Well, I heard Dallas is pretty bad with the crime.
b	Uh huh.
sd	The same way here in Dennison.
sd	but I'm pretty sure they'd been shot and put the freezer at the fast, food restaurant.
sv	They don't have that much money on hand,
sv	they really don't.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	My husband worked at a gas station when he was a teenager.
sd	and one of the guys that was working was shot,
sd	and, Kenny quit the next day.
sd	he couldn't deal with it.
aa	Everywhere.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It just seems like a lot of people are attracted to the bigger cities though,
sv	the worst part of it.
sd	I lived in Louisville, Kentucky for a while,
sd	but Louisville was pretty bad especially during like the, Kentucky Derby.
sd	At this time of the year it's horrible to live in Louisville.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	The ones that blink off and on.
qy^d	By themselves I mean.
b	Right.
qw	How many kids do you have?
qy	a boy or?
sd	that's what I've got,
qy	are they babies or,
sd	I've still got babies.
sd	I've got a four year old. He'll be four. And a three month old.
sv	And it's scary , sometimes.
sd	we don't live in the city,
sd	It's still more crowded than what I'm used to,
sd	and this one's got houses on either side and, you know, real close together,
sd	They've stolen gas out of our vehicles.
sd	And so he went and got a locking gas cap for his.
sd	They weren't stealing it out of mine so much, because the gas thing is kind of weird where it's hard to, syphon gas out.
sd	and they tried to break that off.
sd	And you , excuse me. He went down to Uba , and noticed that it was hanging off where they had tried to break it off.
sd	And they stole our tailgate off his truck .
sd	Well, we can't say they did
sd	and, you know, they'd seen it earlier.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, the only thing that we can do as citizens is, you know, like, watch groups that they'll have.
sv	But they can be dangerous too.
sd	I've thought about it.
sv	you can get yourself into trouble.
b	Uh huh.
sd	They'll break in in the daytime,
sd	and you try to get in your house
sd	that half the time it takes you to break in.
sd	a professional could break in, in, half that time.
aa	It is.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I want a German Shepherd.
sd	I don't want any of those ones that will up the kids,
sd	but I do want a German Shepherd.
sd	Because my husband will leave every once in a while, for,
sd	he works on the railroad.
sd	And I'm scared here by myself.
qy^d	And loud.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well that's, now that's one of the best deterrents for a robber is a noisy neighbor even if the neighbor's got a noisy dog.
sv	That's a deterrent.
sv	Because they know that that dog's going to bark.
sv	But it's easy to fool a dog too.
sv	you know, throw them meat or
sv	a real intense burglar can just get another dog that's in heat.
sd	you know, saw it on T V.
fc	it was.
fc	And maybe we'll meet up again.
fc	All righty.
ad	So, describe your family budget.
sv	and to some extent, utilities, I imagine.
sd	but it's not quite as good.
qy^d	I guess you own a car.
qy	And you know how much you're going to drive every week?
sd	So there is a real family budget.
b	Yeah.
sv	If you're lucky.
qr	Exempt or nonexempt.
sd	We have the fixed things we have to pay.
sd	But it seems that by and large the extras just don't exist.
sd	car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry.
qy	is insurance bad there?
sd	Well, we've got one eighty nine.
bf	four hundred and something a year.
sd	That's cheaper than we pay.
sd	Well, here in Colorado it's even worse because we have no fault.
qy	Do you have that there?
sd	Well, no fault's rather funny in Colorado, because it seems that everyone pays all the time instead of just the guilty party pays.
bh	You're kidding.
ba	God.
sd	Not at all.
qy^d	They don't even try to keep up with it.
ba	God.
qy	So you lived in Texas for a while.
qw	where you from originally.
bf	so you just basically went home when you had a chance.
ba	That's nice.
sd	I'm a native Texan.
sd	West Texan.
sv	There is a difference.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Well, I'm a West Texan.
sd	Lubbock, Midland Odessa Amarillo, Dumas, Panhandle.
sv	A different world from down there.
sd	And every time you look at the mountains or think about looking at the mountains, you got to throw in a dollar.
sd	but that state income tax is just eating me alive.
aa^m	Property taxes and,
sd	and they just get you every direction they can.
sv	but it seems like they trying to get you every which way.
bh	yeah?
sd	I've heard of the book.
qy^d	Legally, cut money on your taxes.
qy^d	And that includes everyone at T I.
sd	Well, even, you know, the nonexempts, technically yet we haven't had our salary frozen yet.
sv	You know, survival is a funny state.
b	Yeah.
sv	and it doesn't seem to get much better for the exempts either, unless you're twenty eight or above.
sv	It's really a shame.
b	Oh.
sv	I think if somebody's not on drugs, they have no reason, you know, to be afraid of it.
sd	like, I don't think one test positive should, be, the end of it, you know.
sv	I think they should test more than once.
b	Uh huh .
aa	That's right.
sv	There's so many jobs that, really have other people's lives in their hands or even their own life
qh	how can you do anything about a problem besides if you don't know about it?
sv	You know, and I, I think there definitely needs to be some control to it.
sv	I guess it is possible to have a false positive report.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Or somebody's test gets mixed up with somebody else's.
sv	I mean, those things do happen.
sd	I certainly wouldn't want people's lives ruined wrongly.
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and you maybe need to look for some other type of job to do that, doesn't require the testing.
sv	I think people have a right to know if, their life maybe's in jeopardy or, Yeah.
sv	If not immediately, it certainly does eventually.
sv	It doesn't seem to, bother the quality of work
sv	but eventually it does.
sv	and it's destroying a lot of people's lives .
sv	and I think that person, plus anybody in danger should know about it and be aware of it.
sd	So, I kind of get off on a tangent here.
qy	do you work for, Texas Instruments?
b	Uh huh.
sd	That's near Dallas.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	It's pretty hot down there probably.
b	Yeah .
bh	did you really?
ba	that's great.
sd	we need rain real bad up here.
sd	everything's really getting dry.
sd	and, it's getting real bad.
sd	I can't think of anything else,
sv	there's a lot of people that think that there's nothing wrong with .
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
ba	I'll be darn.
sd	the different cultures and that too, .
sv	I can't think that would make any difference whether it was legal or not,
sv	it would still have to affect you the same way.
b	Uh huh.
aa	you go by their laws.
sv	and, some of the countries are very much against drugs
sv	and you use them, you pay for it .
qw	where is it if they steal they lose a thumb or a finger?
qy	Is that where it is?
ba	I thought, wow .
sv	You know, that's quite a deterrent .
b^r	Yeah.
sv	So I guess, you know, we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about how great out country really is.
b	Uh huh.
sv	they abuse it is what they do.
b^m	Yeah.
b^m	Yeah.
qw	What age, if you don't mind me asking.
sd	I'm in my early fifties ,
sv	you're young .
qy	Every day?
ba	I can believe that .
sd	Right now.
sv	I think probably the big major change is the role of women.
sv	I think, one, the women, in the work force.
sv	but they're more apt to be in political offices now.
sv	I think, you know, we've made great strides in that respect.
sv	I think that thirty years ago, when, I was newly married, family was very, very important.
sv	I think the family unit is becoming much more important than it was.
sv	Well, I know that economically, a wife almost has to work anymore.
sd	And yet, I'm also noticing, in the areas that I'm working and stuff, more and more women are wanting now to stay home with the children where fifteen years ago they didn't.
sv	but they still wanted to be their own person out in the work force.
sd	But I am seeing women now wanting to stay home more, at least until the children are up to, you know, school age.
sv	And, I find that very interesting that it's sort of reverting back.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	uh huh.
aa^r	uh huh.
aa	Probably.
aa^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I, I note that I had, taken care of my grandchildren recently while my daughter and her husband had been out of town.
sd	And I do not envy these mothers or these fathers that have the children that they have to rush home from work and pick them up at day care, get them through their homework, get them to their soccer practice get them to their piano lessons.
sd	I don't envy these young parents .
aa^r	That's true.
h	I don't know.
sd(^q)	and you know, running into these, women that are wanting to have their children at the age of thirty nine, forty, I'm thinking at the age of fifty two, you're crazy .
^q	And you're absolutely nuts .
sv	but you can also get gray hairs and have a nervous breakdown .
o	Okay.
sd^e	I don't,
sd	but I have nine younger brothers and sisters.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Or probably even baby sitters would be the same thing.
sd	and I would want to know if they've had any past experience with children.
b^m	Uh huh.
aa	that's true also.
b	Uh huh.
sd	The only other thing they asked me is what I would expect in pay.
sd	You know, and, I was pretty surprised because if I had a child and someone, you know, I personally would ask for people that that person has baby sit for before.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	so she just asked my mom if I could baby sit.
sd	One was still in diapers when I started baby sitting.
sd	But, with today's world and the kids today, I can't say that I would just ask someone, you know, that I didn't know like that to baby sit.
aa	that's true.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I would be too .
ba	my.
b	Huh uh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	well, I, obviously you've never had to look for a day care or anything.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	or what was it?
b	Uh huh.
sv	I would say most people would probably go by word of mouth.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Then again, did, money come into play with it at all?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
o	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I am, too.
ny	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's good.
qw	And how old is your baby?
sd	Well, I walk two and a half to three miles every night.
sd	My husband and I were on Nutrisystem about eighteen months ago
sd	and I lost twenty one.
sd	and we walk our dog every night and go up around the elementary school.
sd	We have a little path that we do. except if it's raining or real cold which it hasn't been
sd	we try to get out, every night.
sv	so I think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned.
aa	Yes.
sd	so we will just go out after that.
sd	So, my kids, luckily, are old enough I can leave them at home alone while I go out and walk.
ny	Yes.
aa	Yes.
sd	my husband never was either until he lost the weight.
sd	and his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise.
sd	So, he gets excited when he sees us put on our shoes, our walking shoes.
aa	Yes.
^2	Making time for it.
b	Yes.
sd	I do, too.
b	Right.
sd	I never do either. Even if I have my dog with me.
aa	You know, it's nice to have another person there,
sd	and sometimes it's my kids.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I did the dance step when I lived up in Michigan
sd	and I got to the point I dreaded going in.
sd	and it doesn't cost anything .
aa	Yes.
sd	That's the one time in the day my husband and I can get away and talk without having the kids jump in and ...
aa	Yep.
aa	Yep.
sd	that's all I do, too.
qw	on a scale of one to ten where do you stand and why?
aa	true.
b	Right.
sd	But because I know that's not going to happen, then I have to probably right up there about an eight .
sv	and that's basically what the gun control would end up being.
aa	Well, it's very true.
sv	It's the ones that are going out and stealing it.
sv	I mean, they'd have to be almost world wide, which we know would never ever happen.
sv	some idiot would come out and sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck.
sv	we maybe want to overthrow the government .
qo	what do you think of this, law that they're putting into effect that you have to wait X number of days before you can, carry the gun, or you know, actually purchase the gun?
b	Yes.
qy	have you participated in anything like that?
sd	and you can just take it up there and drop it off.
sd	And everybody up there looks pleased with themselves when they're taking their stuff in like they're doing something good to, help the earth, I guess.
sd(^q)	like yesterday I was tell him, you're supposed to squeeze the plastic jugs before you take them up there.
sd	Every time he turns around I'm giving him some new rule, where you're supposed to you know, like collapse the plastic jugs. Instead of taking them up there solid.
sd	We like to just put our newspapers in a paper bag, you know, and then carry them up there that way.
sd	And we have to bring the paper bags back every time. Because they won't take them.
qrr	or does someone pick them up?
sd	our aluminum cans, we like to take them to one of the places where they pay you for them.
b	Uh huh.
qy	but. Do you, have any ideas on anything that would make,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ba	that would be a good idea.
b	Yeah.
sv	that would be a real good motivation for people.
sd	my father was telling me about some program he read about where like you buy your garbage bag from the city,
sd	so how ever many bags of garbage you throw away, that's how many you have to pay for.
sd	They are talking about going to curbside pickup in our city .
sd	Rowlett, Texas.
qy	Do you know where that is?
sv	Although, I think a lot of those programs can operate at about a break even point, without charging people.
sv	I guess it just depends on how they manage it.
sd	The center that they've got now where you take your stuff in I think that should be making some money. Since they just have to hire someone to man it a few hours a week.
sd	And I guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it.
sd	and I don't know anybody that takes that.
sv	I think it's a good reason to quit buying it.
sd	that's what we buy the most of, unless we're going on a trip or something where we want to,
fc	It was good talking to you.
fc	bye.
qw	where you at?
br^m	In where Rome , New York?
sd	He's reminding me of where I live,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
sv	but, eth , and ethics, socially and ethically I think it's a good idea, in certain crimes.
sd	and these people are getting out like three to five years before they're even suppose to be considered,
qh	or is the world really that rotten .
aa	I know.
sd	and they passed it, which basically means without an F B I check any person here in this state over twenty one can get a gun .
ba	that's good.
ba	that's great.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but in Florida, in the state of Washington when they had the Ted Bundy case
sd	but it was in the, I think the second or third quarter of last year, nineteen ninety
sv	but I mean there should be more cases like that where I might be too cold too, but they flip a switch,
h	I don't know,
sd	So many times.
b^m	Yeah.
sd	he's not the only one, you know,
sd	and they changed all the facts that they said it was true
sd	and they buried her alive
sv(^q)	and you're thinking that's nice.
sv	but it does serve as a pun , definite, pun , you know, lasting punish ,
sv	in that particular instance,
sd	and we happen to live in Dallas which is extremely crime, ridden,
sv	and when you're gone from some place for about six years as we were, you really begin to see, just how problematic just living is, even suburban, no matter where you are,
qy^d	you're in, Rome, New York,
qy	and, is that like near Albany or Syracuse,
qw	what type of area is that,
qy	is that in term,
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
qw	How would, how is the situation in there in terms of crime and, and things that would,
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Not the harsh criminality, that you find in,
sd	they believe that, if they kill somebody, you know, tit for tat and, deed for deed that, that does something,
sd	I mean, they really are over, crowded,
sd	I don't think they have capital punishment there.
ad	so, well, we'll forgive each other .
sd	and I can't, I haven't lived there in twenty, years
sv	that's a different subject, altogether
sv	you and I think are honest and candid because we could do it in this, vehicle,
sv(^q)	but I think everybody if they were touched by it would say, if they had any sense of rage that could be brought out, I think every human does, } I think they'd say, yeah,
sv(^q)	do it if somebody in my family or if it happened it me, you know,
sd	and when you see how many repeat offenders there are, check fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and, rapist getting their hand, just slapped, you know, and how it is based on the judge and if the time of day that the court is in session, you know, all these, i , intangible things
sd	you wouldn't want to be a criminal either because you wouldn't know what you're getting,
sd	methods of capital punishment I have no opinions on that either
qo	how about the injection,
qy	is that suppose to be.
qy^d	it's more that don't have it,
qy	isn't that correct.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but I haven't been back here long enough to realize whether or not, if they've done it in the last,
qo	so, what do you consider the most important benefit besides salary?
^2	That week,
sd	I'm a graduate student that,
sd	I don't have that many benefits per se .
sv	I think health insurance is real, real important. I've, I've, I've discovered.
sd	they have a mandatory, they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance
sd	but I still pay them a hundred dollars a semester for, mandatory.
sd	I'd rather that went to something else.
sd	I don't, you know,
ba	wow.
sd	I think she gets, you know, about two weeks a year, I guess
sd	They, you know, usually let her,
b	Yeah.
b	really.
b	Yeah.
sv	well, that's a that's reasonable, I think.
b	Yeah.
^2	Weigh all sorts of other things.
sd	and in other cases it's actually bad because it winds up people, you know, they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	Least off, who decides.
b	Right.
sv	You want to know that, that when you pick a doctor, you know, you could pick one who you could have some sort of a feeling about.
ad	Why don't you tell me about your choir.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and then he can play, which is kind of interesting.
sv	I think it's because he's always heard music in our home since he was a baby.
sd	my husband and my other son, who's eleven just got through singing in a musical here, in the community at Music Man.
sd^e	and that's lots of fun.
sd	It was the Plano Repertory Theatre.
sd	and my son played one of the children in a band.
sd	and my daughter takes piano lessons, too.
sd	we get the T V off and just have some nice quiet music.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	I have him take from a friend of mine who teaches Suzuki. Which is an auditory type learning experience.
sd	You listen to the music and then learn to play it by hearing the intervals and things like that.
sd	I guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things.
sd(^q)	we went, wow
^q	we better have him s , do something. You know, educationally.
sd	My husband and I love to go to the musicals downtown, though.
sd	So, my husband and I love to go to the musicals when they come into town into Dallas.
sv	I think that's great.
sv(^q)	and you're like God, I really want you to do it.
qh	You know.
ad	if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it.
b	Uh huh.
sd	That's like me.
sv	Well, it can get expensive
sv	that's for sure.
sd	my friend is very generous in letting us have my children, do the Suzuki method without paying a lot out.
sd	so it's been good for our family.
ng	I don't have any Suzuki students.
sv	or, you know, in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do.
sv	And, as far as a high school course, I could see it as, maybe a sociology course to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program
sv	and to me, that's fine to have a student do that for like or even a year
sv	but to tell them that they had to do two years thereafter, post high school, of community service, I'm not quite sure if that's appropriate for anybody to be telling somebody they have to do.
aa	Exactly.
b	Right .
aa	Exactly.
sv	You have to do so much as far as in community service now.
sv	If they were, you know, abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse.
sv	but I could see that working in , you know, cases where it might be young teenagers getting in trouble with law and teaching him that there is a whole community that is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or whatever.
sv	so I could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled,
b	Uh huh.
aa	We sure do.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^q	but I didn't get any rehabilitation
sv	you know. But then again, those that have physically assaulted somebody, that's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program out in the community if they're of a violent sort and to say ,
sd^t	well, about nursing homes, and older people.
sd	my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother
sd	and I, help with her and bathe her and feed her.
sv	It's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty four hours a day.
sd	she has Alzheimer's and does not remember, a lot if anything.
sd	And so she asks the same questions over and over again. Which is not you know, unrealistic.
sd	and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question.
^q	and just come over and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented.
sd	She's ninety two.
sv	I think that's wonderful.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I was just going to say.
b	Yeah.
sd	but they can go and reside there like little apartments, places in between places.
sd	And I like that idea if they can handle it themselves.
b^r	yeah .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
^2	Nursing homes.
^2	Visit.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
aa	That's right.
sv	You know, I think nursing homes are, some are good
sd	I have to say that.
sv	But for the most part I truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children.
aa^r	right.
sv	You know, I think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice to have them go there.
sv	And then if you find out that they are not having good care, you know, I'm sure that it is just, you know, you'd pull them out of there so fast.
sv	it's a very, very hard decision I think.
aa	I think that's right,
sv	and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment.
sd	and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to help him out.
sv	And that might be a partial solution, or something.
sd	But, I personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before I think I'd ever,
sv	Well, I think we kind of are along the same lines.
fc^m	Good to hear from you.
fc	Have a lovely day.
sd	and there wasn't a tax on food that we purchased at the grocery store and things.
sd	because I'm sort of feeling like we're getting a better deal here , than what I was accustomed to.
sv	and I think, I guess, what I feel is that most people, they don't like to pay taxes because they feel like there's some people that aren't paying their fair share.
sv	And, that makes you feel bad.
sv	And that's not fair, to me.
qo	How do you feel?
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
ba	no.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
aa	Yes.
sv	and so, I think, you know, our salaries are a little bit higher because we have to pay taxes on it.
sv	and, but some of the people that make a great deal of money and everything I wish that they would, I guess, because I'm not one of them , I wish that they would, you know, realize that they couldn't make this kind of money,
sv	they couldn't live that kind of life style anywhere else.
sd	even if they made that kind of money, there's some countries that have like, fifty percent income tax, you know, that have, socialized medicines and things that,
sv	but they need to pay for it, too, because they couldn't do it somewhere else.
sd	I mean, that's what I've always heard.
sv	There's something about, the industry in the state, That,
sd	but, they would have, so many community outdoor theaters and, And like, community country club type things.
sd	and I really liked that.
b	Huh uh.
sd	but, I'm willing to pay for that for my children.
sd	and having seen other countries, I'd much rather live here and pay taxes, than live somewhere else and not .
fc	it was nice.
fc^t	and so, you get luck of the draw
fc	anyway, well, good luck to you.
fc	Bye.
o	Okay .
ng	well, we probably have about three months, approximately.
ny^r	Uh huh.
sd	but we do have a garden.
sd	I wish I could be doing that .
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qy^d	You almost have, to get started pretty early probably. I guess,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	You've had more freezing or this, yeah, Winter, I think.
sv	More bad weather.
b	Uh huh.
qrr	or are you retired
b	Uh huh.
sd	but he really isn't, real crazy about gardening.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and and I like my garden too .
sd	but we planted corn last year too, which takes quite a bit of space
sd	and it really damaged the corn
sd	so we didn't get too much corn, last year.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
ba	that's great.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	and other years we've tried newspapers
sd	but we do our watering from our spring.
ny	Yeah.
sd	and, my husband set up a pump that runs,
sd	and then it stops,
sd	and we use that to water our garden , with
na^r	I do.
na	I love it,
sd	I'd rather be doing that, than housework .
sd	I think our cabbages, and broccolis and that we have more trouble with, that type of thing, with the,
ny	Yeah.
qrr	or do you, use insecticides?
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	it's just the it's just a lawn .
qy	Do you eat any of them?
qy	well, did, does your wife ever make, a hot bacon dressing, like for, salad?
sd	and it goes real good on dandelions.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ad	use the greens, if you get them when they're young and tender, you know, before they have grown too, too tall,
sd	because they do get a little stringy.
sd	But, they're kind of fun to try,
ad	and then throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	so, wasn't allowed to run a lawn mower,
sd	so, it takes about four hours to cut our grass.
sd	but, I'm getting on to it,
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	a lot of people don't have that much space even.
bf	So you have all the conveniences of, a city,
bf	and the country also.
sv	Well, you never have enough room do you think. Especially if your into any hobbies or anything.
br	Rolly Polly what?
qy	Is it a bug, You mean?
qy	A worm?
qy	A cutworm?
qy	Not a grub worm?
bk	Oh.
sd	I'm trying to think of what they are, what kind, they could be.
sd	You find them under bricks usually, and that.
sd	They're not a slug.
aa^r	Yeah.
qy^g	They were not hard are they?
qy	Are they a hard worm?
b	They're not a hard .
qy	 are they black then?
qy^d	But they roll up.
sd	I can't think of what kind they would be.
sd	I'm no help on that, then. Because, I can't think of what they are. What they would be.
sv	I think you have a lot more insects down there even than what we have.
sd	I know, my brother had trouble with fire ants, and that even.
sv	And they be can be a real dickens.
aa^r	Uh huh.
aa^r	Yeah.
sv	you keep trading them .
sd	So, we have daffodils, here in the house because of the cut flowers,
sd	but they're just beginning to come out and bud.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
sv	they're such a nice bright early Spring, color.
b^r	Uh huh.
sv	And they're, beautiful too.
sv^r	They're beautiful.
ba	my.
sd	We won't have too much here for another couple of months yet.
sd^e	it's raining today.
sd	We really didn't plant anything.
sd	I suppose maybe you call it crabgrass even.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	It's probably, very pretty.
oo^t	We could talk about my favorite subject .
nd	Food .
sd	So, I am just trying to perfect some things.
sd	It was horrible .
sd	I don't know if the cake was horrible or if I made it horrible.
ba	Hey .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you use celery seed in your tuna fish?
sd	Was for tuna fish.
sd	Celery and onion and,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and I use like, Miracle Whip salad dressing instead of the actual mayonnaise because I really don't like the Helman's Mayonnaise.
sd	But if you use salad dressing with you know, kind of, I guess a tart taste. Then it comes out real good.
sd	I feel so silly
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	I just did not have those things.
sd	I would have put eggs in there also.
^2	Celery seed.
qr	Do you use a regular mayonnaise or, The Miracle Whip.
b	Yeah.
sd	I do that also.
sd	Just to put a little zing in it.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Anything barbecued I will eat.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I make that once in a while.
aa	It is not really, once you have all the ingredients
sv	it is just the layering really. And not breaking the, pasta.
sv	That is the hardest part probably.
qy	Do you make cheesecake?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Well, did you get a chance to watch any of the games?
bk	okay .
ny	Yeah.
sd	and he was out there playing.
sd	I think he only had like eight points at the end of the first quarter,
sd	they thought that was big news.
qy	who do you normally pull for, the Mavericks or,
bh	yeah?
sv	because that's just dollars right out of the franchise.
sd	Now I, I've always been pulling for the Lakers for a long time.
sd	And, not just because they always win,
sd	but, when they had, Akeem anybody who was old as that playing that well, you know, I just kind of had to go with them.
sv	and it also helps when they were winning .
sd	I will take a look at the individual score, you know, in the individual stance in the N B A
sd	usually hardly any, anybody in the top twenty except for, like, Magic
sv	I think they do really play much better as a team than they do, each one, you know, individually at their spot .
sv	and I think they're really giving them a run for their money.
qy	Did he get hurt again?
sv	I guess it's tough to play that many games and still stay healthy.
sv	He ought to have his own bed come along with him, you know .
sd	jeez, it was like, thirty five baskets in thirty seconds or something like that from three point range.
fe	Unbelievable.
qy	did you ever play much basketball?
b	Yeah.
sd	It really is for a noncontact sport, quote, unquote.
aa	really .
sv	Some of those guys got pretty funny looking, eye wear.
ba	Man.
sd	and they were all the basketball players there to play the Cavaliers
sd	and they were standing in water that was like six foot, you know,
sd	it looked like something out of Africa
sd(^q)	he says I weigh about, two hundred and forty pounds
sd(^q)	but he says it's not much when you stretch it over seven foot one.
sv	But, he's got to be way up there.
sv	God. that's a lot .
sv	That's a lot of guy coming down on you.
qw	who's supposed to have the, the best, draft picks?
b	Yeah.
bh	yeah?
sd	went down there a couple years on the day of the draft
sd	They usually have, you know, a video, highlights of the season, you know, and basically kind of walks you through what happened to the Mavs and who they traded for and how they did and a lot of good footage, both the good and the bad
qw	so who do you thinks going to win the playoffs?
sd	shoot, I can't remember them all now.
aa^r	yeah.
fe	Jeez.
bh	Think so?
sv	those guys really hang tough.
qy	Have you ever been up there to Boston Garden?
sv	Basketball's gotten to be a lot of fun.
sd	I do a fair amount of cooking.
sd	it, I like to prepare chicken, that seems to please everybody, pasta or a casserole.
qo	How about you?
sd	Well, that's about the way I prepare most fish.
sd	So, if you are looking for a French recipe, that was good.
b^m	Sesame seeds and bread crumbs.
sd	And, my husband liked it.
sv	unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive, fish items.
qo	How about you?
qy	Do you have any particular places you like going?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I have been there.
sd	but I do not think it's a chain.
b	Oh.
sv	and I always, feel like the home cooking places, are the healthiest meals.
sd	You know, I tend to have chicken fried steak when I go to them.
qw	how was it?
b	Uh huh.
sd	And my father teases me about gourmet cooking. Which is not always true,
sv	and the thing about experimenting with cooking or anything else, is that some of the experiments fail.
sd	I was, sorry I did not have ice cream to fall back on.
ba	my that's ambitious.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	One of the things I do not make is dessert.
sd	And that's why when I did this experiment for the company we had about three weeks ago, it was just a total fiasco.
sd	but that was a fiasco.
ny	yeah.
sd	so I can live without dessert for the most part.
qrr	or do you cook for others?
sd	Well, when I was single, I think my favorite meal was a baked potato.
aa	yeah.
sd	or if I had a little cheddar cheese, sometimes I would grate that up.
sv	And, it's amazingly satisfying.
sd	but it was satisfying.
sd	so I ate very simply.
sd	I mean, I must be a frustrated chemist or something like that.
sv	Cause cooking is a little bit like being in a chemistry lab.
sv	and have an explosion.
sv	Sometimes it blows up anyway.
sd	and it does turn to toffee inside the can.
sd	And I had to have my, my, my dad sort of entertain him for , for awhile while my mother and I scrambled to clean everything up.
sd	I just remember how embarrassing it was.
sd	just that one time.
sd	and , well, it was a memorable evening anyway.
qy	are you old enough to know about the war?
b	Uh huh.
sv	you are old enough.
sv	But it was on the fringe.
sd	If I had been a male or in Israel, I would have been number two.
ny	Yeah
sd	So I learned a lesson in gender .
sv	I guess I think it was, not that great that we were in there, in terms of for how long it lasted.
sd	You know.
qo	What do you think?
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah.
sv	And in full faction,
sd	But I was a little bit older before I realized just how long it had been going on since L B J and
sd	so in terms of when you were in school, I am sure that it was, you know, the majority of your high school and junior high years.
sd	one of the things I did not like was the weapons, I can't even say it, the weaponry systems that they used.
sv	it just did not seem that, I do not know, technically we knew what we were doing either.
sv(^q)	and you would think, you know, just, how could the government or the Pentagon, or whomever is in charge there been so careless.
^2	Conscious,
sv	monetarily too, I just do not think we have done enough for the, Vietnamese people as a whole. in South Vietnam, in general, in helping them restore themselves.
sd	You know, and I don't know if it is because there are not any oil fields there .
sv	But I just think it is kind of a shame that, you still hear things about the children that are orphans there
sv	my main opinion would be w , we should not have done it.
sd	Well, that is what I know about the Vietnam War .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Vietnam?
ba	Jeez,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	In terms of the personal.
sv	The bitterness is more on a personal level than on a,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I mean, because I know, in nineteen sixty three, I mean I was nine years old, when Kennedy was shot.
sd	But then as I got older and studied in school, I realized it was even going on before that.
sv(^q)	You know, and you think to yourself, my goodness, Eisenhower .
sd	but it is that kind of idea.
sd	like a friend of mine called it the yellow ribbon syndrome.
sd	They were not given the,
fc	But thanks for talking to me.
fc	is that where you are at?
fc	That is beautiful where you are at.
fc	Are you a native of there?
fc	but at least the humidity is, below forty percent, which makes it kind of like Phoenix.
fc	Really?
fc	well you are not missing too much then .
fc	Well, take it easy.
fc	Bye bye.
qy	should young Americans be forced to do a year of service?
sv	I think something like the Peace Corps is a bit harsh.
sv	No kids,
sv	I think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two.
sv	and no one just realizes it.
sd	and then to become an Eagle Scout you have to do a yearlong project.
sv	I, I, now I think people generally volunteer.
sv	That there's no problem with getting them to, do stuff.
sv	So, I guess if we all give five hours a week or five percent of our salary we could,
sv	or just gave, or, or, or just to, force kids to serve for, parents, I guess.
sv	Substitute.
sv	No problem.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've seen that.
sd	they, just started trying to get something together l , like, like that around here for, from the community because, we had a big ice storm very recently.
qy^d	You sound like you're in the south somewhere.
sd	I'm in, New York.
sd	Upstate New York,
sv	Long way,
sd	And, basically, in our city, I'm in Rochester which is, right upstate. } Half of the trees in the city, are no good anymore.
sd	Everything is just down everywhere.
sd	You know, we had three hundred thousand people without power.
sd	and there are still people who don't have power.
sd	and there are still something like ten thousand people without power.
sd	Funny thing is the national news how they covered it.
sd	and, and we've been in a state of emergency you know, for ten or eleven days.
sd	and, they're you know, putting out ads now for people to come volunteer, or to have their organizations come, volunteer to help clean up the streets.
sd	and, all, a lot of older folks need help getting, their yards cleaned out because they can't afford to pay anyone
sd	and they, and they certainly can't carry it themselves
ba	that's great.
qy	And is that supported by all donations to the church and so forth
ba	That's real nice.
b	Right.
qy^d	and I bet it gives you a real good feeling to be doing that.
b	Yeah.
ba	that's, that's real good.
sd	and some did elderly visits,
sd	And I'm convinced that, that at least twenty five percent of our school participated in some sort of group. You know, activity like that.
sd	my wife was big in that .
sd	it was a small school .
sd	There was Big Brother, Big Sister,
sd	they had a dance marathon for charity or, to support that, group.
sd	Such that, you know, lots of people got involved that way.
b	Yeah.
sd	I think it should be completely optional
sv	I mean, the Peace Corps doesn't pay very well. You know?
sd	I have a, a friend whose or daughter is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala right now.
sd	and, you know, I know I could never afford to go visit a kid in Guatemala.
sv	and, and the kid's certainly not making much money.
sv	So I can see where that, may be a problem.
aa	I don't,
sd	and I'll do my little community service throughout, but never never for a year again.
qy^d	so I guess our vote is no .
fc	Well, it's been nice talking to you again.
fc	but everything, you know,
fc	so, The rest will just have to come with time.
fc^m	Well, good luck to you, too.
fc	Bye bye .
qo	So, how do you feel about the metric system?
qy	So you used the metric?
b^r	yeah.
sd	And, you know, you know, it is broken up in, you know, the inch is broken up and has been for quite some time in tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten thousandths, of an inch.
sd	and the metric system comes easy to me.
b	Right.
sv	To go from eighths to sixteenths to, thirty seconds and remember where it falls, it ...
sd^e	I drink beer.
^2	whiskey is in liters.
sd	point seven five liters and then liters and then one point seven five liters,
b	Yeah.
sd	I always wondered about that myself.
sd	and they had quarts at the same time though.
b	Yeah.
^2	Liters.
sd	Everything's still fractions of inches, or tenths or thousandths, or ...
sv	It is a conversion thing.
b	Right.
sd	And before that we had a Horizon. you know, Plymouth Horizon?
sd	And both of them were a mismatch of both American and metric.
sd	The engine itself was mostly metric because it came from Canada.
sd	And the starter was Bosch American,
sd	and one of them was metric.
sd	and on, you know, the factory fittings, you know, the factory, screw lock radiator hose clamps.
b	Yeah.
sv	it's not a problem either way.
sd	Like I said, my only complaint is where they mixed them on the same car.
sv	and you don't know which set to reach in, American or metric.
^q	well, is that a metric bolt.
na^r	right.
qy^d	and my other concern is, is the American government going to force us to go.
aa	absolutely.
sd	It will always be.
sd	Twelve.
sd	There's twelve troy ounces to the pound.
qh	and is that going to change too?
qy	And are we still going to maintain drams for perfume?
qy^d	It's all metric all ready.
qy	Will a shot be an ounce?
sv	and you're lost.
sv	The economy.
sv	Personal tools to be able to do his job.
sv	A three to four for eighty dollars.
aa	Real fast.
sd	Your end mills will be measured in inches or fractions of inches.
qh	You know.
qh	What size hole?
qh	As in metric size hole or an American sized hole?
sv	I think that there is something definitely wrong with our school system just because of the results that you see coming out of the school system, as far as, people dropping out of school, grades on test scores being low, more and more people taking G E D s trying to get out of high school instead of just going through high school.
sv	You know something must be wrong as far as, not just the teaching techniques but just motivation, within the schools themselves.
aa	Uh huh.
bd	it's okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I understand how, supportive they are of their students and how excited they are,
sv	but some how, I don't think the students are getting excited.
aa	uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^2	Progress,
sv	not even that much probably.
aa	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And speaking of doing what you want, just in society today being that it's nineteen ninety one, a lot of teenagers and young people have a lot more freedom as far as what they do, as far as, you know, even something as simple as staying up late, watching television late, going out late, start dating,
sv	you start dating too early, you know,
sv	just little things like that, that do start in the home,
sv	and so any other part of your life, that's going to definitely affect your school life, because you spend so much time there.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and he, he will have gone to school five years.
sd	and the reason that he was doing so badly a couple of years ago was because his mother died,
sd	and he was having to, support his entire family, take care of his brothers and sisters, you know,
sd	and all that had an adverse affect on his school life.
sv	And, you know, any other aspect of your life,
sd	and, you know, it, it was there, it was just, I guess school was not a number one priority for him at that time.
aa^r	uh huh.
aa	exactly.
b	Uh huh.
aa	exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	or I don't care, as long as it's something that's going to do some good or that looks like it could be beneficial,
sv	I mean that's the point we all should be at, is like finding some solution,
sv	because there's not a lot being done.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Take them out.
aa	not very far at all.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	right.
b	Right.
sv	An a lot of the parents now are so young.
sv	I mean it's a vicious cycle, that we're, you know, smack dead in the center of
sv	and it's almost impossible to swim back up.
sv	there's definitely problems,
sv	they're going to be on everyone's mind for quite a while, too long.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	There's definitely too much leeway as far as,
sd	I mean, I've been out of college only two years,
sd	but, I appreciate more what I had.
sd	And I had all these classes and all this knowledge and this big library across the street from my dorm,
sd	and I just didn't take as much advantage of it as I should have.
sd^e	I went to U T at Austin,
sd	So, I mean all kinds of resources and, you know, just there,
sd	but then, if I was young, I wouldn't see it.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I should have taken those continuing educations classes or whatever they were, you know,
o	I'm ready .
sv	I think they would be better off being at home with their family, you know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	In a situation like that maybe it would be better.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sv	see, now that's, that's really a sad situation.
aa	really, you know.
b^r	right.
sv	in a case like that, you know, you more or less think it would be better if she were in a nursing home because you have your family growing up where,
sv	but the cost of these nursing homes are so, You know,
sv	a lot of people can't afford that.
sd	and it was costing him a small fortune to keep her in there.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and then usually they want to go to bed fairly early anyhow.
sv	You know, so that would probably be nice if we could ever get something like that
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh,
b	Uh huh.
sv	But if they have their wits about them and everything, why, it's kind of hard .
sd	but there's, so many of us kids, there was like seven of us that, we wouldn't have probably allowed that to happen anyhow.
sd	You know, she could have taken turns living with each one of us, you know, for a sh , a period of time because we all don't live in the same city anyhow, nor the same state
o	Okay.
qo	So, what do you think about it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know someone that works in all three different stages like you said.
sd	or most of, one of their spouses has already passed away.
sd	And it's really nice for them because then they're with people their own age, and people that have gone through things exactly what they have gone through.
sd	and I know it was hard for me as well as it was for them to actually sit down, because she doesn't like doing things that the younger kids like doing.
sv	so it's really nice to see that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and there was a girl in my class who did a speech on home care of the elderly.
sv	like whenever they're in, you know, the older people, they're like, fastened to their beds so they can't get out just because you know, they wander the halls. And they get the wrong medicine, just because, you know, the aides or whoever just give them the wrong medicine.
sv	And so many of them, you know, are,
sd	and I mean, she did research on it and everything.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and it's just a little cubbyhole,
sv	and they're still paying that much.
sv	it, it just sometimes, it just seems ridiculous.
^q	stay in the house as long as you can.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It sounds like, an apartment or som ,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
sd	well, I've lived here for thirty years,
sd	and we don't want to leave.
sd	we've run into a lot of that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	but everyone has basically their own room.
sd	none of them have cars because they can't drive.
sd	And it's really nice because that keeps them going, too, rather than just sitting around.
sd	and we play bingo with them and, you know, like, stuff like that.
b	Uh huh
sv	just to keep them going.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Uh huh.
sv	I think they would have to agree to go in it.
b	Well, yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Where are you, Bob?
sd	I am in Waco.
ny	Yeah.
sd	My favorite subject .
na	do I.
sd	I get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle. Where you use them a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off
sv	so you use a credit card.
qy	Do you use them a lot?
b	Uh huh.
bk	Oh.
qy	Is that that through a VISA?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I pay, like the minimum.
sd	So I have got myself,
sd	So, it is kind of strange.
sv	In, In debt.
qy	Have they put the cap on the interest rates?
sd	I know they were considering it.
qy^g	Funny how that works, isn't it ?
sv	I think it would be amazing how many more people use it.
sv	Because of the economy.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think that would be interesting.
sd^e	I have a credit union.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	I work for Channel six.
sd	it's an N B C affiliate down here.
qw	What is your,
bk	okay.
qy	You ever work with Davis?
ny	yeah.
^h	And, what else.
nd	Well, I live actually in Hewett.
sd	right outside.
bf	So, that is where Davis Iron Works is.
h	but I am not sure.
b	Prime Air.
qy	Have you ever been to Marlin?
sd	It is called H G H or something like K G H or,
sd	I can't think of the name.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	we have stories out there
aa	I know.
sv	they are bad at Hewett too. On eighty four.
qy	have you noticed any new, trends in politics?
sd^e	I didn't hear that.
sv	I don't see any problem with outsiders going in and getting a little bit involved.
sv	and he obviously failed somewhere along the line.
ny	Yeah.
sv	but I'm not sure if the way he goes about what he does is really right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it seems like every area should have an equal voice.
nn	No.
b	Yeah.
qy	Diane Ragsdale?
b	Yeah.
sd	and I don't know why certain groups are fighting so hard to keep the ten four one.
nn	huh uh.
fc	Okay.
fc	Good talking to you.
sd	if they're forgetting things or whatever, I'd prefer to have them at home or have them in what they call now home care where somebody comes in
sd	But they were not given the time
sd	and they were not given the money, basically, to staff, appropriately, people to help.
sv	but hopefully, they have.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
sd	but I'm sure that some of the patients were, given medication to keep them quiet
sd	and I remember one time watching one of the, schizophrenic patients actually go out on, I don't know what they call it, a binge or whatever you want to say it
sd	So I think there's laws now That nursing homes either have to keep the mentally ill totally away from these people and not in the same type of facilities,
sv	They don't have these tendencies to lash out.
sd	I wouldn't put my mother, father in that nursing home at all.
sd	A small town.
ny^r	yeah.
sv	I think if you have a big city area, I think there's more people to keep watch on it.
sd	And this is back in nineteen seventy seven that I worked there
o	Here we go.
sd^t	like how was it, maybe ten, twenty, thirty years ago as opposed to what it is today
sd^t	how we're living socially in comparison to maybe from that time period from ten, twenty, or whatever you remember it to be.
sv	and although it's more publicized as opposed to what it used to be it seems like violent crime is on the increase from what I've seen,
sd	our economy, too, it's just not what it used to be in the sixties or even fifties from history from what I've read,
sv	To me, also, our nuclear family is not the same because more people are living together that aren't married
sd	but, I don't really want to either , because I have no problems about it either way
sv	and, kids are, I suppose have been raised by single parents more than they ever used to
sv	women are more on the rise too so far as getting their careers established,
sv	and, they don't no longer feel dependent upon men,
sv	I mean, they are, a lot of them that have to put their kids into day care or having more with baby sitters,
sv	and, I guess that's why you always hear these stories about kids being neglected.
sd	she was caught going to work and leaving her daughter in her car all day.
sd	I would say she was five to eight years old somewhere along that range,
sv	but that's just an extreme example.
sv	I would imagine, you know, the situations are out there.
aa	I agree there.
sv	I could agree with that, because used to conservatism was inherent at a much younger age,
sv	It's just a hop, skip and a jump to get into a plane to go from the east to the west coast
sv	and, well, I think what's happened, too, is just our technology is just advancing so rapidly that, and there's so much information available out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up, aside from just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day
sv	the cable system and the satellite dishes has made it to where a lot of people can just leave regular T V programming and watch a variety of programs out there, as well as use of the V C R
qr^d	so that, I don't know if it really hampers or it helps our education system.
qy	Do you watch L A LAW?
sd	I like that.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	at least you're hitting the books, right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	of course, going to school, too, it's different from the home environment,
sd	because that's all that we had
sv	but, I mean, it's, for the top medium of entertainment.
qy	Even at your age?
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see.
qy	Is there anything else?
sv	of course, we , we're having to weather through the savings and loans all the other scandalous items that, well, the greed that overwhelmed us in the eighties
sv	It's going to be really passed on to your generation and maybe a few others including what's left of ours .
fc	Well, it was nice talking to you.
qy	is, that a sport you like to participate in?
sd	but I stand there and swing and swing,
sd	and I can't even hit the ball .
sd	I don't either .
b	Right.
bf	so he's really into it.
ba	Wow.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	more because of their personalities than their sportsman .
b	Right .
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
sv	he's interesting.
sd	I like to watch him.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	I think you're right.
sd	I like to watch those skins games.
sd	for each hole they win they get the money for it.
sv	I think those are pretty exciting.
aa	yeah.
sd	I sometimes wonder why men like it so much because they get so frustrated and mad at themselves when they don't do well.
sd	They play like maybe once a month or less
sd	and they think they're having a really good game .
ba	Wow.
ba	that is good.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	Something to stay active at for a long time.
b^r	yeah.
sv	and they can still get good at it.
sd	Well, maybe that's what I'll do when I have time later on,
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
ba	True.
sv	just ride around in the cart with him .
sv	Go somewhere really nice, like Hawaii, and just look at the golf course.
sd	so he's not too bad to watch.
ba	no,
sd	because he'll talk about the other guys he plays with doing that and how immature he thought it was and stuff.
sd	So I guess he's real laid back about it.
sd	and he'll tell me what a great day he had, and about this great shot he made and everything .
qy(^q)	Did you have to listen to long stories about, now on the seventeenth hole I hit it and went this way
sd	it's hard for me to, act nice about that when it goes on and on,
aa	Yes.
sv	and then they want to play another course they're not a member of
sv	and other fees.
sv	It really is high.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Me either.
sv	at least you're just com , you're competing against yourself, I guess, more than everybody else out there.
sd	that's, kind of the way I feel.
b	Oh.
sd	Well Brent, I kind of gave up my career about three years ago to stay home with my children because I thought, it's only going to be another year until the youngest is in school.
sd	And I thought it was a good sacrifice to make, because, it was important to me to spend some time with kids.
sd	and I would leave,
sd	It was like that they thought that's the way life was, that you didn't have two parents at home at the same time.
sd	and we do things together.
ny	Yes.
bh	you are?
aa	Yes
sd	right, and then we try to do a family activity on Saturday, usually in the morning.
sd	but, it's real important to us to spend time together.
sd	I have two.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b@	 Uh huh.
aa^m	They are a handful.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and it's just not, it's not as stable for the kids,
sd	and everybody decided to come over and talk to me right now.
sd	I try to go out of my way to plan things that he can do with the kids because, since I am home with them and so I get a lot of time with them, he needs to have, some time with them.
sd	So when he comes home, he, you know, it's his job at night. He puts the kids to bed,
sd	and he reads to them,
sd	and that's pretty good quality time, with them,
sd	he wants, Right, he wants to run out and get things done,
^q	or why don't you do something.
sd	And if I have something in mind, then he remembers that, that's what he wants to do.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's not nearly as important.
sv	We find that, you know, back just even fifty years ago when people had financial problems, the first place they went to was their family.
sv	but now, you know, they don't support each other that way.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right
sv	And it's not an easy sacrifice for a person to make, because, you know, you know, I have interests that, too,
sd	and it is hard to make, those interests not be as a major part of my life.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	in the middle of it, it seems like a long time,
sd	Well, I see that we both share the same belief here that it's important that we spend time with our kids
sd	and, and, in spite of,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
aa	That's true.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, it is, the hardest thing I've ever done, as much as you'd go out
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's good.
b	Uh huh.
sv	You can at least say that it's important to our country, that our family unit stays strong.
b	Yes.
sd	I'm still a graduate student.
b	Yeah.
sd	so it wasn't that specialized.
b	Yeah.
sv	people are getting pure technical science educations and not getting very good liberal arts sorts of issues.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Well, that must be helpful.
sv	and save specialization, I guess, for graduate school, unless they're sure early on they want to do something like engineering or something.
sv	I think we do some they have pretty good engineering here.
sv	people are forced to sort of take all different kinds of classes here, which I think is wonderful.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That would, be very good actually.
sd	so the first year Humanities courses everyone had to read the Iliad and so forth,
sd	but then, afterward, we all wound up taking extra art history classes, because it just seemed like something we didn't totally know nothing about, but just enjoyed very much doing, and something I would never would have done if I wasn't forced to take it.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I feel a little more worldly now .
sd	I'm, I'm hoping, I'm hoping.
sd	and I went for like two or three weeks and realized, not enough time for the work unfortunately.
^h	what else.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	You had real world experience in the middle there.
qy^g	And that helped, you think?
sd	I've, I've learned much just sort of by watching her and her business as well.
b	Yeah .
sd	Well, I'll take that, I'll take that and think that through a little bit.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
sv	you have, just in general, maternity leave plans that kind of thing.
sd	so I've had a chance to kind of take a look at, the pros and cons of both.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That's pretty good for, you know, being a school district type program.
o@	* slash error like the small corporation that I work for. There's no pension plan
sd	It's not accumulative, type of sick leave you know, things like that.
sv	they don't have as good as insurance packages as big corporations.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Is it a union?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
sv	I mean, i , it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position, sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I'm talking like hugh companies like Three M, Honeywell, Texas Instruments
sv	Partly it's because the owner wants to keep getting richer and richer.
qy	Are you interested in that at all?
b	Uh huh .
sd	But I wouldn't want to go out and buy it like, you know, the hard back copy of it.
sd	But I might check,
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And I wouldn't want to sit down and just read it cover to cover, but flip through just to get a good laugh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Was it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	A while.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh!
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	Usually, I'm going to the book store for a particular reason,
aa	Yes.
sd	so I bought a couple of books about how to buy a house and what to look for, you know. or how to repair this or repair that in your own home.
sd	well, you know, like some, medical symptoms, like how do you know when to take your child to the doctor or not, type books, which I use as reference and have been real handy.
sd	or I just enjoy, you know, the newspaper magazine.
sv	It's handy.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
^2	Light reading.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's not like, most television where you know, you just, you can sit there and not even pay attention very much but, still understand what was going on.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Not too much.
sv	Well, I think it is good to read books and, because even if like you say, it's light reading, you are still getting some, mental exercise .
b	Right.
aa	That's right.
ba	That's good.
b	Uh huh.
fc	 Well, I was.
fc	I'm home now, full time.
fc	we think books are important around here.
fc	Well, you have a good day.
fc	Stay out of the rain.
fc	Bye bye.
fp	Good morning.
ad	go ahead.
sd	I was in the Peace Corps and, Peru,
sd	but recently I have been following the Middle East rather than, Central America .
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
qy	did that have,
bf	and they weren't.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	like sometimes when Americans go into foreign countries they tend to flaunt American things, Americanism, consumer products, T V, the whole works.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh .
b	Uh huh .
sd	but, there weren't, as I recall, or at least I wasn't aware of that many Americans there except for a very heavy concentration of Peace Corps volunteers,
sd	this was when the Peace Corps first are started,
sd	and, and you couldn't just, take off and leave your group and go explore and things like that,
sd	although I was living in the slums, I was really working with the middle class.
sd	I was up in Arequipa .
b	Uh huh
sd	I mean, I was, Per , Peru thirteen, which meant there were twelve groups before mine, that had gone in
sd	health, inoculation and things.
sd	because, some of the Peace Corps, that I knew of, did marry Peruvians, and have been back
sd	and then, of course, Peace Corps bowed out of that because that's, something that nationalized very quickly.
sd	And the same with the co ops.
aa	Right.
qh	I mean, why should we push English,
sd	but basically I taught it in Spanish, because, I mean, I really didn't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test.
fp	Good morning.
fp	My name is Jean.
qw	where you from Tina?
sd	I'm in Pennsylvania.
bh	Really? .
qy	Do you work for Texas Instruments?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I don't know what .
sd^t	So, I guess we're supposed to talk about foods today.
aa	uh huh.
qy^t	You ready?
sd	foods like you would for a dinner party or something like that.
sd	and I don't think they ate all that much different .
sv	course, for a dinner party, you fancy things up a little bit more.
b^r	uh huh.
b	uh huh.
sv	and it's not as good as if it's fresh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Is that right?
aa	well, they probably were trying to do the best they could.
b^m	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think that tea is big in the summertime mostly.
sv	Of course, you have warmer weather most of the time.
b	Yeah.
bh	Is that right?
b	Uh huh.
bf	More like covered dishes for those type of dinners.
nd	just about anything .
sd	well, like we had a dinner party here not too long ago with a mystery dinner party .
sd	But, basically, we you know, included all the basic, foods that you are supposed to have in a meal .
sd	or least what it used to be the regular menu was followed and , ham and bake potatoes,
sd	something from each area that you're supposed to choose from.
sd	and, we've really been enjoying those, meals.
sv	and, they really are very good.
qy	Is he a meat and potato person?
sd	They are out on their own.
sd	And, it's much different
sd	and we ate that when he wasn't going to be home for supper,
sd	that's what we had .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
sv	those always go good.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well maybe. that's good the way the things are going.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Children usually they like the ham and the hamburgers, and that,
sv	and it is easier to chew.
b	Uh huh.
sd	We don't really you know, entertain too much.
sd	we're more, once in a while, but mostly family, activities.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well that's good.
sd	we do a lot of that take , things to church
sd	and, that's what we do mostly, most of the time for that.
sd	you just bring, what you like .
sd	sometimes, you have all vegetables .
sd	and you can , have pretty good meals, from one of those.
ba	those are fun.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Was there enough to go around? .
b	Uh huh.
sv	that's kind of irresponsible and does upset you, because they are grown adults usually ,
sv	and you know they know better.
sv	Even if they can't do it, they can always maybe get somebody else to cook .
aa^r	Right.
sd^t	They said that we share, a recipe
sd	I don't even have any of my recipes with me.
b	Oh.
ba	great.
fc	Well, have we talked long enough
fc	Okay,
fc	You have a good day.
fc	Uh huh.
qo	how do you feel about, the way the U S has reacted in the Middle East?
b	Huh uh.
qw	What is the Woodward book you are referring to?
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
sd	I was very against our involvement so quickly.
aa^r	Huh uh.
sv	I think we're very naive as far as that part of the world is concerned.
sv	In spite of all the promises.
b^r	Huh uh.
aa^r	Huh uh.
sv	And I'm not sure we're sensitive to other cultures.
b	Huh uh.
sv	I mean, awareness.
b	Huh uh.
aa^r	That's true.
b	Yeah.
qo	And, what about the whole situation with the refugees, the Kurds?
qo	But, what about the Palestinians?
b^r	Right.
b	Huh uh.
aa^r	Huh uh
qrr	or should we have just stayed out of it?
aa^r	Right.
b	Huh uh.
sv	because, I mean, I mean, I don't think, it's our world to westernize the whole world,
sv	so the fact that the Saudi could just sort of pull back and, remain, you know, culturally sort of clean is interesting.
aa	Huh uh.
aa^r	Right.
sd	Well, you know, I mean, I actually lived in Beirut from sixty eight to eighty four .
sd	And so, I mean, it's been dangerous for sometime.
sd	I'm not sure that it's changed that much.
ar	It really hasn't.
sd	so that many of the countries Turkey and Syria are the same as they were for traveling.
sd	so even when things were good in the Middle East, Americans weren't really given visas to go into Baghdad.
sd	but it's a very beautiful part, very interesting historically, of course, which was my interest art history.
fc^r	Right.
fc	and, you know, have a good business trip.
fc	thank you.
ng	but I never did feel that Russia was a big threat to us.
qo	What about you?
ny	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa^r	uh huh.
aa^r	uh huh.
aa^r	uh huh.
aa^r	uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	but yet it didn't happen.
qh	I mean why not.
b	Uh huh.
bf	so you think it was fear that kept Iraq from using it.
aa^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	I don't think we've done that to Saddam Hussein yet.
sv	But yet you know, as the parallel Russia is that Saddam Hussein is using the chemical warfare on his own people.
aa	And I guess that makes sense what you said that, within their own borders they feel freer to do what they feel necessary.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	Well or that it resolves anything in the end. That that negotiations couldn't resolve.
qy^d	Well, it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the Soviet Union is a real threat to the U S.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	right.
fc	well thanks.
fc	Bye bye.
fp	and I'm in California visiting right now.
b	okay.
qy^t	Should we give it a try?
bk^r	Okay.
qw	So, so what changes have you seen? .
aa	Well, actually, that's what I was thinking too.
qh	Is it, perhaps, woman in politics is for the future.
sv	Because I don't see that really yet in positions of power, really.
b	Uh huh.
qr	do you work in private corporation or government?
b	Uh huh.
b^m	Uh huh.
sv	That's the best status.
b	Yes,
sd	A government.
sd	And I work in academia before.
sd	and, I mean, in a since, perhaps, she gets protected a lot because it's almost like a token.
sd	but she's a good paper pusher.
sd	And you know she should be more technical for what she does.
sv	And I think that's sort of unfortunate, because it doesn't really help the cause in the long run .
sv	and teaching I still see that that's where most of the woman are.
sv	you know, and it's always been that way.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Not the deans and things like that.
qr	and do you think it's because women aren't qualified or just don't, or don't want the job or just aren't hired for the jobs.
sv	They're just not selected somehow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but yet I know too.
aa	I'm sure there are, yeah.
sd	but, it , I suppose in a since I was surprised when they told me they majored in engineering.
sd	but I don't know that many men that have majored in engineering, either.
sd	I mean because I'm in the humanities it's just,
sd	You know, it's not, it's not something that I tend to hear about.
b	But, yeah,
ba	that's interesting,
sv	I mean, I suppose that it's difficult to really say why because, you know, there probably are a limited number of women who are interested in the subject and well qualified.
sv	Maybe they don't apply for the job.
sv	Which could be, you know, partially cultural anyway.
sv	So that it might be circularly being the same problem of expecting not to get hired for the good jobs anyway,
qh	so why spend your time getting qualified.
sd	and, in our case we actually have one father who works part time, a six, hour day so that he can take the kids or kid, I'm not sure, to school in the morning and be home when the children or child, comes home in the afternoon.
sd	but he did say that because he was in the humanities and he's now working in more of a technical situation that he had trouble finding a job.
sv	but still it's interesting that, you know, he, he's been doing this evidently for a good number of years.
sv	but it's unusual.
b	Yeah
qy^d	he was, even before they had children.
sv	now that really is .
bh	she was.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I mean I think it would, it would strike one as strange if there's no reason for somebody to stay home that,
aa	Yeah
sv	because if she had offered to stay home we wouldn't have thought anything stran ,
sv	So, so we're, carrying our own prejudice .
sv	I guess we can't win .
sv	Because yeah, if, if somebody does if and breaks tradition you're surprised.
ba	dear.
sd	yet I must say it's not one that I've given a great deal of, of thought to
sd	but, in the past.
sv	It's, one of those things that, you know, seems to happen.
sd	I don't feel for the most part that I've been discriminated against.
sd	but I don't like administration.
sv	So then I'm, probably a poor example, although, you know, I was an administrator and could still be I suppose.
b	Uh huh.
qy	you were more ambitious than they would let you be?
b^r	Yeah.
sv	and that's true that, you know, sometimes other people get higher increments, for, you know, even,
sd	and, I just sort of ignore the administrative, part of it since I didn't like it when I had to do it.
sd	I think it's Friday night.
sd	the one with the two little girls in it, what's it called.
sd	Or three little girls.
b	Right.
qw	What's it called?
ba	there you go.
sd	I really like that show.
b	Oh.
bh	really?
sd	lately I've been getting into talk shows
sd^e	just, you know, controversy and,
sd	Just really whatever.
sd	it depends on the subject actually.
sd	where it's more interesting.
sd	Some of them get pretty boring
qy	Is he one of the talk show guys?
qy	Maury Povich?
^h	let's see.
sd	I like more controversial subjects, I think.
b	But, I mean, yeah .
nn	No.
sd	B Y U.
sd	so everything keeps me pretty busy.
bh	really?
sd	My dad taught there for a while,
ny	yeah.
sd	speech pathology.
ba	wow!
qw	How long have you been there?
qy^d	so you wouldn't know him.
sd	but, he worked there for like fifteen years and then part time U T D at night.
sd	and then they stopped funding the program there. 
sd	and so now he's at Texas Women's University.
ny	Yeah.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	Allen Bird.
ny	Uh huh.
na	Right.
sd	and he has like little stuffed animals with them and like little cards and stuff.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	but I'm thinking about changing right now .
sd	so if I decide to stay in nursing I'll probably come and go to T W U.
ny^m	Yeah.
bh	really?
sd	My dad used to teach at Collier, too.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	I'm at B Y U, in Utah .
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
sd	and I'm so excited .
sd	I'm so homesick.
nd	It's in Provo actually.
sd^e	I really like it out here.
sd	But, I, I've been away too long.
sv	I guess you would consider that a home repair.
qw	What is your most recent,
qy^g	You did that recently too, uh,?
qy	Does it make a big difference?
b	Huh uh.
qy^g	That's neat isn't it.
sd	but we learned how to retile bathtubs and, just all kinds of things that are unusual.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
qy^g	It's nice to not have a drip through from the roof, isn't it .
sv	and, I think it's neat for young people to learn how to, take care of a household, you know, like, fixing dripping faucets, and putting in panes of glass and stuff like that.
qy	do you like it better?
b	Yeah.
ba	That's nice.
sv	Nice to have it come out positive and look, look good.
sd	and , so } that was a really positive,
sv	and it seems to me like it's probably more expensive to put down linoleum almost than it is to put down carpet.
sv	Kind of depends on the quality of carpet, I suppose,
bf	Well, it sounds like you have some pretty good experiences with, home repair.
fc	Happy home repairing.
fc	Bye Bye.
qy	Did you have anything in mind that, you'd like to share?
bk	Oh.
ba	Ooh, that sounds good.
b	Uh huh.
qy	One tablespoon of worcester?
bk	Okay.
qw	How much chili sauce did you say?
sv	That would be a lot.
bh	Is it?
qy^g	this would make a lot, right?
qw	And how much crab meat did you use?
b	One, One can of flake.
qy	Have you ever used the, imitation, yet?
sd	and they said it is a fish product.
sv	So, therefore, you really don't have a very long life, you know once you buy it.
sv	I thought, so, you know, they should put some directions on some of these new things they're making that you really don't know what the shelf life is.
b	You know.
ba	that's a good idea.
qw	Whose was that?
x	,
na^r	right.
ba	that sounds good
qy^d	That must be the ones that look like they're packaged for a restaurant.
bk	Okay,
b	Right.
qy^g	It's frozen in the first place, right?
qy^g	it is frozen, isn't it?
qy^d	And then you can re freeze.
ba	Hey, that sounds great.
sd	And that's my favorite.
sd	And I really don't care for desserts that well other than one piece of it.
sd	that's the thing I hate most about entertaining is thinking of what I'm going to serve.
sd	and I have one of these kitchens that's the center of the house
sd	and so no matter where they're at, your company can see you cooking. Which is funny.
sv	I decided it looks better in BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS than it does in practicality.
sd	But, what I have learned in the, ten months we've lived here, is that when I entertain, I have to have my foods all prepared and in the oven with everything through, ready to serve. Because with the open area, you don't want someone from your dining room seeing your mess, like you said.
sv	So you have to have the picturesque kitchen, you know, right out of the magazine.
aa	You're right.
^q	we have the chairs on the other side of the counter for guests.
sd	But at our point of life we know many of the people we're entertaining well enough that they know, you know, it's very much at home type situation.
qy	so you watch DAVID LETTERMAN?
sd	I, I live in a dorm
sd	and our favorite T V show is CHEERS.
b	Okay,
sd	like here they show it, like, every day.
sd	And then, like, on Thursdays is the night where the new ones come on.
sd	what we do is, we stay up till around one thirty,
sd	and so we just stay and watch that.
br	The what?
b	Yeah,
sd	I used to live in the house that the guy owned.
qw	but, But, so what do you like, why do you like DAVID LETTERMAN?
br	He's got what?
ad^r	wait .
sd(^q)	I go, you better be
qy	do you watch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE yesterday?
ny	Yeah.
sd	you missed WAYNE'S WORLD.
sv	WAYNE'S WORLD was pretty cool.
sd	see, like, like, every time we walk in the room we turn on the T V because we don't want to do anything like study or anything,
sd	like, like, when I was in high school I used to do, like, my homework in front of the T V set, you know.
br	What?
b	Yeah.
sd	so it really didn't matter .
sd	and it worked .
sv	Like, the news we don't watch, because they're boring.
sd(^q)	I mean it was like, haven't I seen this episode before, you know.
aa	I know.
sd	see the thing is, like here they just give you like local news, okay.
sd	Like, a house burned down in this little town.
sd	they're going to spend more time on doing a thing on a cross guard who's a hundred and five years old, than they are on anything else, you know.
qy	do you watch STAR TREK?
sv	well I used to hate STAR TREK.
sd	like, like, when I was, like, in high school and junior high school, I used to hate it
sd	and, like, the new ones are pretty cool because, because they got like, like like especially things, that, like, fuck with your mind.
sd	Because what happened is, like they have this hologram right, where you walk in
sd	and you can touch everything and stuff.
sd	but, you know, it's something to pass the time, till we do
sd	and then we watch football.
qw	Which basketball?
qr	College or,
sd	we got two teams of the A C C going there.
sd	We got Duke and North Carolina.
sd(^q)	like for example yesterday s , some girl goes, do you dares want to go to a picnic, right.
^q	today we're just going to dedicate ourself to watching golf and bowling, you know,
sd	I mean, Somebody told me, like, that, like, you can watch baseball,
sv	and the actual play time that there is is five minutes.
sv	Because the play time is when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the pitcher pitches and it's hit.
b	Okay,
sv	and that's, like, you know, five seconds for the whole play
sd	but when I went home that's all, like, they had on T V
sd	And T V in Argentina's really bad.
sd	because, I wanted to go to school here.
b	Yeah,
sv	they have better computer science up here than they do down there.
sd	and my father works for I B M,
sd	well, we came to the United States in nineteen seventy six, seventy seven and, we lived here for about seven years
sd(^q)	And so then I said, I'm going to move back up there to go to college.
sd	so I did my undergraduate in two years.
sd^t	well, we've been talking for five minutes.
sd^t	That's the only obligation we have.
ad	And, well, tell your dad that now he owes you five bucks.
fc	Okay.
fc	nice talking to you.
fc	Bye bye.
o	Okay Brian.
fp	Fine, thanks .
qy	Are you a total banner?
ny	Yeah.
bk	Okay.
qy	so you think that, maybe a five day waiting period for handguns or that stuff would be legitimate?
sv	but they'd just have to mail it to you, I suppose,
b	Okay.
bh	yeah?
sv	and I think that's the problem that we need to address is why these people want to kill other people rather than the instrument they particularly used in the assault
na	Sure.
sv	but I think banning semiautomatic twenty two rifles is a bit on the extreme side.
sv	And a total ban on guns would just leave guns in the hands of criminals who don't care what the rules are anyway.
sv	or you could do it just for fun, you know, kind of like a game,
sv	I think that I should have a right to own a handgun.
sv	Not a automatic, semiautomatic.
sv	but I think a person needs a way of defending themselves.
sd	the guy came after him with that big knife.
sd	just one shot.
qw	So how is work going?
qy^g	They don't let you take guns to work, do they?
b	Uh huh.
qy	Can they be, Is it concealed,
qy	Has to be on the hip?
qo	what do you do with your credit cards?
ba	jeez.
bf	you had them for each of the individual stores.
b^r	uh huh.
ba	gee.
aa	sure.
aa^r	uh huh.
qy^g	But each of these had an annual fee also, right.
b	Uh huh.
ar	forty five.
sd	so I sent back all of mine, except the ones that were free.
sd	and actually I then got a Discover card since they pay you back.
b	Oh.
b	yeah.
b	I see.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Only once in my life have I not paid.
sd	so that you know, if I were smarter, I would have that same amount in savings and get the interest, which I don't do,
sd	the thought of adding, you know, X percent to the price of what I buy, I can't accept.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I would, that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that I was, you know, juggling payments to different people I guess because I never experienced it.
sd	it's just, a mental concept that I have. Yeah,
b^r	uh huh.
bf	and you're coming out of it all right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	do you use them, more judiciously?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Clothing, sales.
sd	Sales I find are a pain.
bf	Like I said, it sounds like you've really got it under control.
sd	and I guess I had, you know, not really counted on it quite at that point
sd	I was very uncomfortable.
sd(^q)	and I'm going jeez, that's outrageous,
sd	and and, you know, but still, I mean, I figured I didn't need those items if it cost me sixty dollars more to have them.
sv	Groceries for a week.
b^m	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	But now did you use to not feel so badly because you could take it off your income tax?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	right.
ba	jeez.
bf	You were good at it .
sd	I suspect that, you know, thinking about it and looking at my friends and the number of credit cards that they use and, you know, the amount that I know they buy, I guess probably a lot of them are in a similar situation, and, you know, just don't talk about it.
aa^r	uh huh,
sv	and especially if you don't feel you're handling it quite right or that somebody might make fun of you or that it would be,
b	Right.
aa^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but, once I suppose you prove yourself by paying this off next year you'll be in very good shape.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Have you faced, elderly care yet, nursing home care for any of your parents?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
sd	and they were to the point that they only lived, both of them, about six weeks once they got in.
sd^e	And I believe that was one of the hardest things I ever did. In my life.
sv	that, it just, you know, it's absolutely devastating.
qw	What have you found in dealing with the nursing homes?
aa	Yes .
b	uh huh.
aa	Yes.
sd	well, there's a little bit of difference in the two between my mother and my mother in law.
sd	And, one of the things that, you know, I had discovered is that if they knew that I came in there at all different hours, they got much better care than if,
sd	when I started out with my mother in law, because she was in there first, I would go certain hours
sd	And if I'd pop in unexpectedly, I discovered, you know, they did better.
sd^e	And, you know, a couple of times with my mother in law, I would catch something not being taken care of. And, you know, would have to rate,
sd	so I got to where, I knew then when my mother was in you know, not to go the same time all the time. Because they would,
sd	and for some reason I just went back, and on my own went around the different floors.
sd	and they did not come across as well as, you know, what they had originally shown me,
sd	We put her in another one that I went a couple of times when they weren't expecting me and saw, and, you know, was much, better pleased with the situation.
aa	you do.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Does your mother have Alzheimer's?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Did she know that she was going to a nursing home?
qy^r	Did she know that she was going to a nursing home?
b	Uh huh.
qy^t	do you want to give a start on it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh uh.
ba	definitely.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Now see, we don't have any of that because, well, like, we live in the country in Clarion County
sd	and, we really didn't have things like that going on that we, you know, ran into.
sd	I guess when I think of social changes, I think more of, , visiting habits of families and such.
sv	but it's not quite the same as, what it was, say, twenty years ago, thirty years ago.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think has a lot to do with it.
aa^r	uh huh.
aa^r	uh huh.
aa^r	right.
aa	yeah.
aa	yeah.
sv	because when you work you don't really care to go out and visit as much.
b	Uh huh.
sv^e	they don't do as much.
sv	You have to make arrangements or have an invitation or,
aa^r	yeah.
sd	I know our children mostly are scattered out at a distance, so we really don't have that even.
bh	really?
ba	that's pretty good.
b^r	uh huh.
qy^d	Well, apparently there must be work available, for those that are,
sd	but, to make a good living, there really, around here, there just isn't too much.
aa^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I couldn't really,
aa	definitely.
sv	Some good and some bad .
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	They'd rather get their life started first before,
sv	and if you're busy with school I think it's really difficult for a family.
aa^r	uh huh.
sd	and one's one
sd	and the children seem quite adjusted.
aa	uh huh.
aa	yeah.
sd	so this will be new for me .
sd	but the others I'm too far away to help them out at all.
sd	A son in Connecticut.
sv	and, it's too far to, you know, really go too often.
sd	Maryland, maybe five hour drive.
sv	That's worse yet.
bh	are you really?
sv	You're young.
qw	How old are you?
sv	well you're young enough yet to ,
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's work to get there.
b	Yeah.
sd	And it still took a long time because it's not a high speed airplane.
sd	But they enjoyed in thoroughly.
sd^t	You have to call from a different,
qy^t	Are you ready to start?
bk	Okay .
sd	and it doesn't seem like it's that old.
sd	Seems like I just bought it.
sd	and I bought it, in, eighty eight
sd	I really will do that the next time, I buy it too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's wonderful.
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Is that how you,
bh	Isn't that a shame.
ba	That's sorry.
ba	My word.
ba	mercy.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Sure.
aa	That's right.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Who makes that car?
qrr	or is it European
bh	it is Japanese.
bk	Okay,
sd	I didn't know.
b	Okay .
aa^r	Yeah.
^h	if, if I had the car I wanted.
fe	Gee.
sd	Probably, let's see, I like the looks of the Lincoln Town car .
sd	That's a, Ford product,
sd	and, you know, I would get hung up by my boot straps if I ra , if I ever mentioned the Ford product in my family.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ad	Can I put you on hold for one minute?
sd	They hung up.
sd	well, the comfort of a large car that the security of a large car. and the luxuries of a large car.
sd	I think I would opt to go with a bronze. Which is probably closest to gold that you can get .
aa	Yeah.
sv	and it's cooler I believe, too, when you're driving in,
b^r	uh huh.
b	Oh.
ad	can you, hang on again hon ,
sd	I've got the phones for lunch hour.
ad	Just don't mind me if I bounce back and forth.
qrr	or is it talk shows.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's true.
qy	Do you listen t , Do you listen to W R R?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv^e	those are nice.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd^t	we are talking about computers this morning.
sd	I have a Zenith here
sd	and at home I have a Commodore and a Zenith,
sd	and my wife has an A T and T Twelve Hundred, I believe it is.
sd	I have written some, programs in Basic whereby I can select any number of, drawings and from that extract the numbers that have appeared the most
sd	I have another program in which I can look at the cyclical, appearance of these numbers to see if there's anything that's consistent on that.
sd	and then it generates a complete set of numbers so that all combinations are covered
sd	so this is what I do most of the time,
na	On my Commodore
sd	and I write all my letters
sd	my, thoughts in my head come in bursts of about a paragraph at a time,
sd	and I get them all down,
sv	you can go back and, correct it very easily
qo	So how about you, Charles?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	So, where, may I ask where you work, sir?
qrr^d	or what, what section of it,
sd	I work at the Applied Research Lab here on campus,
sd	and, my field is underwater acoustics
sd	and there's a lot of things we can do with computers into, studying how, things vary in the water, you know and, taking advantage of them, and so forth,
sd	and I am retiring at the End of December, excuse me.
sd	but I, I'm a full time researcher
sd	and it's, been a very, very interesting career, believe me.
sd	but I have similar machines at home.
sd	I would consider doing some more consulting when I get home
sd	and I play in several symphony orchestras
sd	and so } I have a lot of external, interests
sv	but I do want to get much more deeply into computer work, because obviously the world is going to be controlled run and operated by computers in the future.
sd	and the amount of work that we're doing and the depth of things that we are studying can basically only be handled by computers, because, it's so much involved
sd	Here again let's say I'm starting to getting ready, in preparation for retirement
sd	For many, many years I had a full size acoustics, study laboratory where I could take recordings and, perform experiments with them and so forth,
sd	fellow named Steve Blazey was the fellow I worked with for many, many years
o	well, let's see.
sd	Five.
sv	Well any number is nice, let me tell you.
sv	It's not as fair to the children either, I do not think.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	How to just entertain themselves.
b^r	yeah.
sv	and you take one that's used to being, busy having something to do all the time, it makes a big difference.
qy^d	keeps you busy.
ba	Well, that's great.
sd	they built a home just a couple miles from us.
sv	and then, then start looking for schools.
sd	and we talked him into going local here first.
sd	He went to aeronautical, just learning to work on engines and that.
sd	and they build and rebuild non jet engines.
sd	and she got really the same basic education that she wanted.
sd	And they have all really got really good jobs.
sd	I, I always thought she would change her mind, you know,
sv	because if they get an education and are willing to go where the jobs are, they can make you know, a much better income.
sd	You know, that boggles, my mind.
qy	did you go to college?
sv	See it makes a difference.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Some place else.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^2	Different life styles,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	they say, you should not look at the expense of the college when you are looking.
sd	Because, they say that a lot of times you get more help, with a more expensive college.
sd	Now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school.
qo	what do you consider an invasion of privacy?
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's very easy.
sd	Now, I've never, I've never had that happen to me either.
qy	Does it bother you to give it?
sd	You know that they now have a, I believe it's a federal law that you do not have to give your phone number on charge tickets.
b	uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	uh huh.
^q	I'm not going to give it to you, either .
aa^r	yes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but I get catalogs from people I've never even heard of.
sd	And I know they have to be coming from my charge cards, you know.
sd	because then I'll get catalogs that, you know, are within that range that I would never order from ordinarily,
sv	and I think of how inept our post office is and how that's taking up you know, all their time to sort
sd	and they're not even paying full postage.
sv	You know, and if you did away with some of that, our postal service might give better service.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	no.
sv	computers can be gotten into very easily if you really have the, the know with all, if you're, you know, so inclined to, what do I want to say, have the smarts to be able to tinker with something like that. You know, and have a basic knowledge,
sv	To tap into a system.
sv	I mean, you know, our lives are on computers.
sd	I resent the calls of an evening trying to sell me something.
sv	they understand the plight of people.
b^m	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa^r	uh huh.
sv	I would think that for, like people that are just filthy, filthy rich,
sd	and I'm speaking about people that are like born rich,
sd	and that's all they know,
sv	if they were to work in a, I don't know, a soup kitchen or something, they would understand how other people live
sv	and, you know, on the same note if poorer people, are working to serve the community, I don't know, they probably have a better perspective of life itself.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^2	demeanor,
b	Right.
ba	That's great.
bf	and maybe he wasn't before,
bf	and now he sees,
sv	and I think that anybody that works in some kind of service or for the community or something, they can see, you know.
sv	you don't, you can't know what you don't see, you know,
sv	but you, they don't know what poor is, unless they actually see it and, you know, help or something.
b^m	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	and, if you want to send like, you know, fifty cents a day, or something like that
sd	and you can help a child.
sv	I mean there are so many scams, and things going on, you know,
sd	I would love to help somebody, you know,
sd	but I can't bring myself to trust this, this company who is trying to do this or whatever it is, you know,
sv	I don't know, just today people are just so money hungry, that I think they would do anything,
sv	and so you don't know what they,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^2	More self centered, uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	But you can't do that today.
b	Uh huh.
sd	everybody left their, doors open,
sd	you just run, in the store,
sd	you leave your car running, you know,
sd	it's been almost ten years since I moved here.
sd	I mean I don't go out I don't go, outside at night, you know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
sv	that would be the exact opposite of here.
sv	I mean if you leave something anywhere you might as well forget it.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That is sad.
sd	That's, a big, that's a big thing with me.
sd	I'm single,
sd	I live in Waco, okay,
sd	and you either live in really low priced housing or you live on the other side of town in the high price apartments.
sd	but I live in the high price apartments simply because I feel safe here
sd	but I wouldn't be able to sleep at night
sd	and that to me is worth the extra money for me to be, you know,
sd	I feel very safe where I am, you know,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	right.
aa	Huh uh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I was talking to someone yesterday about that.
sd	And we were saying that the, the basic family is disrupted these days,
sv	and having that mother there, that base, I think, was a big part of family, a big part of what, you know, your, youngsters thought about, what they did, you know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
o	All right.
sv	when we pay so much for the debt, instead of using the money for where it ought to go, it's just, it's ridiculous.
qw	what is it, the act where they had to cut everything across the board
sv	That's exactly what they needed to do to get their act together.
sd	they don't try to, to conserve.
sd	and, I mean, when I don't have money, I don't buy something.
aa	They sure don't seem to.
sv	If it's a good idea it can be done again.
sv	At least you haven't thrown out all the work they've done for months and months and months and months.
aa	that's right.
b	Yeah.
sv	that's just an awful lot of that kind of thing going on.
sv	You don't know enough to know what to do about some of this stuff.
sd	I just can't believe there aren't other people out there that could do just as well as what we've got.
b	Yeah.
aa	I think that's right.
sv	the, the idea of what you need to exist is so outrageous that it's not hardly.
sv	it starts everywhere until we've just lost control of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable, you know.
sv	you can't even, can't even conceive of what they're talking about.
b	Yeah.
sv	They need to restrain about what they do.
b	Yeah .
sv	if we pay off the debts then we can give it to people again.
sv	but you need to get rid of this thing that's just, eating us up you know, and get things on an even,
sv	if it were a family, we'd be up before the magistrate for doing all these wicked things, you know,
sv	and it's all right.
aa	that's true.
sv	it's good to see them doing some things there anyway.
b	Yeah.
sv	it just isn't fair, though, that when this happens in some places, it needs to all come off everywhere.
sv	They need to put that into action and show they mean business. That they've got to cut costs.
sd	Well, I don't really mind paying taxes for positive things that are helps, like roads and making sure that, that water is safe, and some of these things.
sv	You feel like they do not have control of it.
^q	I could help the poor people better by myself than they're doing.
b	Yeah.
sv	if they don't, if they don't pull it in and start doing something, I think they're really going to have to I think.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
sv	But still, you don't want it to get that bad, good heavens.
aa	No,
sd	But I would just like to know that they're not being foolishly spent. That they're doing something that's positive for for somebody.
sd	maybe I do more than I,
sd	I use them in roads and lot of things,
b	Yeah.
sv	The state actually did some good work in that a couple of years ago.
sd	Sam Johnson came out and talked to us about that about what they had done.
sv	And they really had done some good work.
b	Yeah.
sv	and and I think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too, if they don't take that early stand.
b	Yeah
sv	The growth is fast enough so that they can't afford to just dawdle and wait until something til they need them.
fc^t	about nine.
fc^t	I just heard about it and found it fun .
fc	Guess I like to talk, that's all .
fc	Right.
fc	Bye now .
sd^t	I pushed it.
qrr	or do you hire someone to do it?
b	Uh huh.
sd	We need rain badly .
sd	here in Patterson, I can water on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturday and Sunday, four days a week.
nd	It was this last summer,
sd	now if we don't get some rain, they might limit it to not even four times, you know
sd	and I do our planting of bulbs and things where I can have some spring flowers
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd	and I'll probably go outside today and plant that.
sd	But, I like to have the roses where I can have cut flowers all year long.
sd	I even had, roses on my table for Christmas dinner which was really pretty, you know .
sd	I plant gladiolas
sv	and they bend over so fast you know.
b	Uh huh.
qy	well, is it one of those Amaryllis?
b^m	No,
qy	Do you have a big yard?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	right.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	Well, that makes it nice.
sd	but we don't have one you know,
sd	but they are a lot of people that do have pools around here you know
sd	but we just have dogs and, and grass you know, the cement work and a little play set we made for a garden.
sd	but we, had lots of tomatoes, and, zucchini
sd	and it's amazing you know, how many plants you can plant in there
sd	Few cucumbers.
qw^d	Wondering how you keep up on the news.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I get the WASHINGTON POST
sd	because I'm not going right on the hour.
b	You know.
na	Right.
sd^t	and that's what we were asked to do.
b	Right.
fc	Well, thanks for discussing it.
fc	Bye bye.
ad^t	why don't you go ahead first.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
sd	so that's kind of how we do it, from month to month depending on what insurance is due or whatever.
sd	long term, that's a little bit easier for us because, with our jobs we can take out extra money towards savings, Four Oh One K plans you know, retirement plans, that kind of stuff
sd	so we can kind of put aside some money that actually is better for us not to see versus when it's on the paycheck
sd	so that's kind of how we do it anyway
sv	so you'll have that
qy^d^t	so. I don't know if our time is up or what .
qy^d^t	They'll let us know .
sd	Automatic, you know, deposit from checks to where you don't see it.
sd	And, you know, exactly whatever is in our checking account is basically just about what gets spent.
sv	and that's it,
sv	And you don't get a good return on it anyway,
sv	it's a bad time, you know.
sv	so your better bet is to, try to get in with something with your corporation if they have some kind of, savings plans or something like that to where they kind of match the percentage or whatever or some kind of profit sharing
b	Sure.
o	Okay .
sd	I find it hard to believe that a lot of the hair sprays and things that we use cause the air pollution.
sv	but I guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home you know,
sv	and it's kind of dangerous.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
qy	But you think the mountains are kind of a barrier?
ba	That's an interesting thought.
sv	and so I would think that that would probably contribute to us not having that big of like a smog problem or something like that.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I guess I've never really, thought about the fact, like in California they have a lot of smog problems.
sd	And it's real hilly there.
sv	I think probably just, a lot of factories, you know, they have the smoke stacks, I guess you call them and different things like that.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Aren't they supposed to be coming out with some sort of, special gas or something that doesn't emit certain chemicals or something?
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
aa	the diesel.
b	yeah.
sd	truck, you know.
sd^e	I don't.
sd	I work in Waco at a T V station.
sd	My mother works at T I.
ny^r	yeah.
qy	You work at T I?
bk	okay.
bk	Okay.
bk	okay.
ba	That's interesting.
sv	Noise.
sv	Noise causes air pollution .
sd^e	that's why I thought of it.
^2	Landfills.
sd	And, it's really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill don't want it expanded, because they're thinking that they're water is going to be contaminated somehow.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	One one of the big concerns is there's a school right across the highway from the landfill.
sd^e	So the parents were really, really upset.
qw	what kind of car are you going to buy next?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	that's true.
sv	but you know, when you're driving down the road you see all these pretty new ones that are out,
sv(^q)	and you think, well, maybe I would like a new car.
sd	But I think I'll be driving mine about two or three more years anyway.
sd	I sure do like the looks of that new Mitsubishi Diamante.
sv	That is a pretty car.
sv	that's pretty, too.
sv	they get pretty expensive.
sd	but it was a demo, returned
sd	and I got it with like, you know, I think it was like fourteen thousand miles on it and nearly ten thousand dollars less than what the list price was.
sd	I was looking at a Honda Accord, a brand new one
sd	and I bought the, the Lincoln Town Car for just a little less money than what I was going to buy the new Honda Accord.
sd	And the thing about it is they give you that ten, that hundred thousand mile, five year warranty where it only costs you twenty five dollars to have anything repaired.
sd(^q)	I said, I probably never be able, to find another one that I can afford, you know.
sd	and you're not even tired.
sd	And it gets like twenty six miles to the gallon on the road.
na	It sure does.
sd	so well, actually before I signed the papers on it, I took it over to Boozier City
sd	and it did it.
sd	and it never happens
sd	but it does get good gas mileage.
sd	Most of the time when I don't go anywhere I can drive it for like three weeks to and from work, you know, and then fill it up,
sd	they have all these lights in the car
sd	and it has this fancy little light that gives you a reading light for the passengers in the back seat
sd	and it stayed on all night, you know just shining right down on them, you know
sd	we turn the knob, you know, in the front that's supposed to turn the lights on and off
sd	and we turned everything we could,
^q	it's broken.
sd	and they showed us where the switch was.
aa	they thought there was really something wrong with it when he told them he had already done the switch.
sd	But he hadn't done the right one.
sd	And it's right on the arm rest in the back
sd	and we didn't know it was there.
sd	And the guy hit it with his arm when he got in the car
sd	and so we thought, you know, there was, it was broken.
sd	I've had it three years now.
sd	But it's just been real minor things.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Like I say, I'll probably never be able to have another one, because I think we bought it for about sixteen thousand, you know
sv	and I said, I'll never find another one for that price.
sd^e	I've been sitting here alternately reading and watching television .
qw^t	he was waiting for what again?
qy	okay?
sd	Well, basically I like comedy shows . MURPHY BROWN, DESIGNING WOMEN .
qo	what do you like?
bk	okay.
sd	and we made it almost about eighteen months without a television.
sv(^q)	but then all of a sudden when you get one you realize, gee . I needed that, you know,
sv	and then you get to remote control the stereo phonic, whatever all of those things,
sd	and now it's like we're just glad we never went out and bought a compact disk player cause we wouldn't use it .
sv	you're at school.
sv	basically junk that's on television .
qy	have you ever seen MURPHY BROWN, or anything like that?
sd	that's the one with Candice Bergen in it,
sv	that would do it.
aa	I know.
sd	but I could tell you in school that, the only thing that ever saw in the dorm was, the one soap opera, ALL MY CHILDREN.
sd	And until then I never paid attention to soap operas.
sd(^q)	but I'm going, jeez, I can't believe that thing's still on television .
qw	How long has it been since you've had one?
ba	my God .
sv	and then you'll get one .
sv	By then,
b	Uh huh.
sd	that's kind of why we got back after eighteen months,
sd	and I'm trying to think about the only other show I watch.
sd	more then that I hate to admit
sv	you know, it's a pretty funny show.
ny	Yeah.
sd	It's just a, you know, over priced downtown, Boston yuppie, you know, tourist attraction.
sd	I'm trying to think what else is on television,
qh	Isn't that sad?
b	Uh huh.
sd	but I like the N B A play offs, back when like the Pistons were in them
qw	where are you calling from?
b^m	Sherman, Texas,
qy^d	you don't have a T V.
ny	uh huh.
qy	My voice you mean?
sd	and, I'm originally from Pennsylvania,
nd	actually I'm a big Chicago Bears' fan.
qy^g	of course you like them too, right.
bh	Do you?
bk	okay.
sd	but, I just like to watch, you know, two players really go at it,
ad	go ahead.
b	OPRAH .
b	Uh huh.
^2	on the, on the tracks
sv	Maybe cause she got chubby again or something,
qy	was her show big when you where in school since you haven't been out that long?
qy^r	Was her show big when you where in college, since you, haven't been that long?
bh	Was it?
sd^e	I saw reruns of it,
sd	I saw tapes of her ,
bh	isn't that terrible.
am	I don't know.
ad	if you don't have a V C R we just got one after nine years don't even spend your money on it.
sd	and then it usually comes on television within two years. You know.
ad^t	in general on this project we're suppose to talk about
sd	I mean, I always .
b	Yeah.
qw	what was his name Wolf Blitzer?
sd	That guy that was a reporter for C N N.
qy	Did you see him when he was doing the coverage of the Gulf?
t1	 what was his name,
sd	I can't remember his name.
sd	they made jokes about him like on the CARSON SHOW and all of that,
sd	Jay Leno.
b	Uh huh.
sv	he's funny.
sd	SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE has changed a lot if you haven't seen it in about a year.
sd	I mean I haven't seen it in a couple of months
sv	they really have funny characters on there.
sd	And they say well, they're trying to deduce what he or she is,
sd	So you still don't know because a fanny pack is man,
sv	it's weird .
sv	I mean they do some crazy things.
qy^d	well, you've must have seen it recently?
qy^d	You probably have some friends that have television ?
qy^d^r	I said you probably have some friends that have television .
sv	You know, I mean you're not totally out of the loop.
b^m	I mean, yeah.
sv	you hear about something that somebody else talked about,
sv	but if you haven't been married that long, you know, you're doing other things .
ny	yeah.
qw	where did you go to school?
sv	that's a good school.
qy^d	They don't have a southern accent up there though.
qy^d	You must be native Texan?
ny	yeah.
ny	Uh huh.
sv	Deep one, you have a deep one,
qw^d	I went to high school in Chicago, I'm trying to think what Purdue kids watch.
bk	Okay.
sd	Do you know that I've never, I think other then accept on a commercial or on news coverage or something, like entertainment tonight I've never seen M T V?
sd	That's kind of what I've heard .
sv	I don't think it's worth ten to thirty bucks a month to pay, somebody, to, you know, give me a hundred and fifty, , channel access to something I'm never going to,
sd^t	I pushed it.
qo	So, how do you use your credit cards?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I won't use one that I have to pay an annual fee
sd	Why I don't just write a check, I don't know.
sd	but I don't carry a lot of cash with me, because I'm always afraid that someone's going to steal my purse.
sd	and that's about all.
sv	and I think that's terrible.
sv	why, it really does help.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	well, I think it's better to use credit cards, too, like I say, because there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing
sv	and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket, they're going to hit you over the head.
sd	I'd just soon use my credit cards and just pay them off, you know.
b	Right.
sv	And, you know, some of those stores don't even seem to check your signature or anything you know,
sd	they just slide it in there and pass it back to you you know,
sv	I think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches, you know.
aa^r	uh huh.
t1	what else can I say about credit cards.
qy	is that what that?
sd	Now I don't have that one, you know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
qy	you mean, for your using your credit card you get like a rebate or something?
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see.
b	Uh huh.
bk	I see.
sd^t	I guess our topic is about movies
sd	and we went to the movies that past weekend.
sd	And we saw CAPE FEAR.
aa	It is.
na	It's really good.
qw	how was that?
qy	Is that true? .
bk	Oh.
bk	Oh.
sd	because, the little boy dies.
b^m	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, CAPE FEAR was more suspenseful.
sd	So that's, that's a real good movie to see.
sv	but it's not as bad as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
sv	But, it's just as suspenseful, I think.
sd	And then we saw BEAUTY AND THE BEAST . Because we have two kids. And FIEVEL GOES WEST .
sd	so, And then, boy, it's been so long since we've been to the movies,
sd	but we've rented some videos.
sd	And I think the last one I rented was, MORTAL THOUGHTS with Demi Moore.
sd	That's pretty good.
sd	and, WHAT ABOUT BOB?
sd	we rented that one.
qy	Have you rented any movies lately?
sd	We rented that one, too.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	So, do you go to the movies often,
b	Uh huh.
sd	and , And that's only the only time we can go out,
sd	so , our time is scarce.
sd	and we try and do
sd	and I don't know about the last movie I've seen on T V that was real good.
sd	 Bertinelli, or what's her name.
sd	and I heard it was a true story.
sd	I think that was probably the last movie I've seen, too.
qy	Did you see that one?
sd	That was supposed to be a true story, too.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Guess a couple weeks ago or something like that.
sv	Boy we have , we see all the same movies.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I know.
sv	Well , We sure do have a lot in common.
ad	If you're ever in town, we'll go see a movie .
qy	do you all have, do you all still have drive ins up there
fp	Hello.
sd^t	so I guess we're recording now.
b^m	Okay,
sd	so I've got quite a bit of spare time right now.
sd	And I've been making dolls, cloth dolls.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	It's not, any porcelain at all.
ny	Yeah
sd	and I make the clothes for them.
sd^e	you can get the little curly hair at the craft shop.
sd	well, I made some of them with regular wigs.
sd	I went to the flea markets and bought, you know, like the wigs for a dollar.
sd	Then I cut a V shape out of the back of them and then sewed them on.
sd	They looked really cute .
na	I have sold five of them, so far.
sd^e	I just have to get a place where, you know, I can sell them actually.
sd	if I would just work all day long, making the clothes and everything, probably about two and a half days.
ny	Uh huh.
ny	Yes
sd^e	I really do.
sd	And, then I also crochet
b	Yeah.
sd	I didn't like it.
sd	but now I want to learn how to knit again.
b	You know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	in fact, I just bought a serger in December.
b	Yeah.
sd	but just what little bit I have used it for, I really like it.
sv	You know, especially making the seams and things like that you know, it's got such a professional finish on them.
b	Yeah.
sd	So I like that.
sd	but they don't have any children.
sd	So, I just make clothes for my dolls.
sd	you know, just like sewing and stuff and decided to buy a pattern and try to make a doll.
sv	you got to have a pattern for the body you know.
ny^r	Yes.
qy	Aren't they cute?
b	Uh huh.
sd	but when I sewed it up, the face of it looked like a mouse.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	See, it was too pointed.
sd	and I haven't tried another one.
sd	but I haven't made it yet.
sd^e	I don't paint, except I stenciled my wall.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
sd	and it turned out really, really good.
sd	mostly flowers you know.
sd	I've done it in all, all my rooms.
o	Okay.
sd	we have small children, two and four
sd	and so our dining is very limited .
nd	We're a little sick of that .
sd^e	like, you know, like Wyatt's Cafeteria.
sd	so you can go in and go out
sd	and any, any eating area that you just don't have to wait an extreme amount of time.
aa	No .
sd	and we were ready to go home.
ny	Yeah.
sd^e	We fought with them for forty five minutes.
sd	and times that we do have baby sitters we try and catch, some things that we normally wouldn't do, you know.
sd	let me see, for New Year's we went to eat at Uncle Julio's.
sd	It's, on Walnut and Greenville.
sd	It's called Uncle Julio's.
sd	basically Mexican food.
sd	it's a Mexican restaurant off of Central.
sd^e	but I've heard about it.
b	Really.
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	We like, seafood, also,
sd^e	we haven't.
bh	Really.
b	Really.
nn	No.
sd	I've seen it.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	It's basically the same thing, seafood Cajun style.
sd	That's in Addison, off of Belt Line.
sd	Midway.
sd	Like I think it's a little past or it's right before Midway, or it's right at Midway.
sd	And, excellent food.
qw	what is that?
b	really.
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Uh huh.
qw	And where is that?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, my birthday's coming up,
sd	I need an excuse .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qo	What do you think would be required, and so forth?
qy	you knew of the homes, then.
qy^r	You knew of the homes themselves?
b	Uh huh
bk	okay.
bf	I realize that you indicated you wanted to check out as much as you can about it
qo	but how do you think they would feel, I should say, about moving from where they have lived most of their life into a whole new home situation?
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	does that cause any problems between the two of you?
b	Uh huh.
^g	isn't it?
b	Yeah.
sd	My mother lives in an apartment with my sister
sd	and, of course, since I see her only once or twice a year, I was just thrilled to have her here with me,
sd	and I spent every minute I could to be with her and, cooking foods for her, you know, just to make her life as though she were on vacation.
sd	and my sister's uncomfortable because her mother's there
sv	and I guess it's just because they're there all the time.
sd	and now all of a sudden she's had to move off of her farm, into another home where the environment is totally different.
sd	And when she complains about the food then they kind of get angry with her.
sv	So, that's another one of those things you have to solve.
sd	because in those early days, the food, they had to make it from scratch, so to speak.
sd	and then they they had to store the meat in,
sd	but they had regular little places they would hang it, you know to cure it and so forth.
sd	it tastes differently.
o	I'm ready.
qr	Do you exercise, during the day time or go to a gym or anything?
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I try to do it at night before I go to bed.
sd	So, I lay out there in the living room floor and do my exercises, you know.
sd	so, when I went to physical therapy they gave me some exercises for my back.
sd	So, I just try to keep that up, because it seems like if I don't, then my back gives me a problem again.
sd	So I try to do it every night,
sd	I can tell when I do it and when I don't do it you know,
sv	so you know it's got to be good for you.
sd	But, a long time ago I belonged to a gym
sd	but, now I notice that in this small city that I live in, they do have a gym that just opened up here about a month ago.
sd	but I haven't even gone down there and talked to them yet.
sd	and I like to bicycle, too.
sv	So, that gives you, you know, lots of exercise.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my goodness.
qy^g	otherwise you wouldn't be able to go very far,
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	well, like I say, I just do it at night, you know,
qy	you try, try to get my stomach muscles toned up.
sv	and once you get out of shape it's hard to get back into shape you know.
sd	So, I try to do it every night you know,
sd	like I say, I'd rather do that than watch television anyhow you know .
sd	So it's just kind of nice, and especially when I have my cat that comes down and joins me.
sd	so I don't go swimming.
sd	but they do say that swimming is really, really good for you you know, for every part of your body.
fc	Okay then.
fc	Bye bye.
qy	Do you use credit cards a good bit?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, actually, I have a whole wallet full of credit cards.
sd	I try to use at least one gasoline credit card a week, and try to use a different one, so that, you know, I keep those active.
sd	and I'll use those if I need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick or something like that,
sd	My biggies are the VISA, MasterCard and Discover.
sd	And for the most part, I had used those for like, charging airline tickets, where I can pay for those, you know, you could make the transaction over the telephone,
sd	or I fly Southwest a good little bit, which means I can just run that card through the machine.
^q	and you do not have any other options
sd	and right now I am paying and praying.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
sd	Most of my charges were, medications.
sd	or the doctor would accept MasterCard or VISA
sv	different labs will use those charge accounts for,
sd	like I said, that was just one period in my life where that was critical.
sd	and I kind of set that aside and just pay for it.
sd	and I can handle, you know, paying for it and waiting two or three weeks.
sv	Getting into a credit card fiasco is easy.
sd	I just cringe every month when I see those interest charges.
^q	I'm saving two percent.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and it's not just paying back what you've charged,
sv	it's paying that and half again.
sv	you're going to pay twenty, twenty five in interest charges.
sd	so I'm looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts.
sd	Now, I mean as the monthly payment amount goes down, that will free up more cash where I can continue to make the larger payments.
sd	as long as I don't have a major disaster where I have to use it again, I can do that.
sd	Meantime, though, I'm not building any reserves.
sd	Anything that I could be put aside into savings is going for interest on those cards.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	right.
aa^r	uh huh.
aa^r	uh huh.
sv	or you need a large reserve so that if you do charge on that account, you can make a single lump sum payment.
sv	Now, those are very handy
sv	if you have the reserves and you can make lump sum payments, sharp, good no problem
sd	because you're living on the other guy's money for a while.
sd	But I can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money .
sd	I've lost a whole day of my life to interest.
sd	but even the payment on that doesn't equal the payment on one of those credit cards.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think that is a good, healthy, safe use of credit cards.
^q	You only use credit cards for investments.
sd(^q)	I said for crying out loud, if I had the money to in , you know, if I could do some investing, you'd have to invest at better than twenty percent earnings in order to pay for the payments on the credit card.
sd(^q)	I thought God dang, where is his pencil?
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	You also have to have that willingness to commit to that because you're committing a good portion of your life and income when you do it.
o	There you go.
sd	Even when you tell them no, they keep calling back.
sd	it's the long distance telephone company.
sd	They just keep calling back.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	You can't force them to be.
sv	No.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah
sd	because they follow them around twenty four hours a day.
sd	And you know they do Ted Kennedy.
sv	it's not the same with Johnny Carson.
qy^d	and without your permission.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ba	good.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
sv	and sometimes it's hard to screen out all the calls that you don't want.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	uh huh.
sd	some days it just rings off the wall.
nn^r	no.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but the questions go a lot farther than having to do anything with smoking.
sd^t	we're on, recycling
sd	and, I am not real well informed on exactly what Richardson does.
sd	and we recycle our aluminum pop cans and stuff.
qy^g	But now Plano has quite an elaborate system, don't they?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Okay.
qy^d	and then they separate it.
ba	that's a neat system.
b	uh huh.
sd	but they have the two separate containers and stuff.
ba	that is interesting.
qh	Because I wonder if that means that if you don't do it
qy	do you suppose they will come and knock on your door and,
qh	Will you,
aa^r	right.
sv	That's true, except that it's hard to imagine, you know, when you have, cans, you know, from the market and, you know, vegetable cans, and et cetera.
b^m	they don't take vegetable cans.
b	This is just their aluminum cans.
ba	that's interesting.
qy	Wouldn't you really like to know?
^q	what are you doing reading , you know.
sv	I think it helps if the city is giving you a nudge to do it because I think there are a lot of people that don't do it,
sd	We got started on the aluminum cans because our, grandson was collecting them, to raise money and stuff for an organization he was in.
sd	so we've kept on
sv	and it's interesting, too, that we drive to Plano at Plano Road to, just inside your city limits, to, you know turn them in to dump them in.
sv	I'm sure there's bound to be some here in Richardson
sd	but we just haven't really seen them advertised or you know, something.
ba	Well, that's interesting.
sd^t	I, I guess I've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues,
sd	and there are some very different views, of the people connected with the program which I thought was really interesting, you know.
sd	and most people in Maryland vote for that, you know.
sv	So, it really is a different,
sd	and I talked with a woman who actually, you know, had just purchased a gun that day, and was going target shooting, you know,
sv	So it's really interesting.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qh	isn't it funny.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and like the Brady Bill that's currently being discussed nationally and whatever is very well supported here, in gun control avenues,
qy^d	You have the seven day waiting period.
b	Yeah
b	Yeah.
sv	the same I know the abortion issue with right to life and right to choose
sv	there's there's always that difficulty
ny	yeah
aa	Sure
sd	But I would never
aa	Yeah.
qy^d	I guess you feel differently.
sv	If somebody buys their own flag and burns it that's fine
sv	but that's you know that's destruction of public property and whatever.
sv	I think what America stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government.
sv	I think that's what's made democracy
aa	Well that's true
sd	and they always talk about they feel that this person believes in the framing of the constitution what the original framers the ideals the original framers set down.
sd	and you can display that.
qy^d	Because, realistically, like for you you don't think it's right
sd	and that symbol means a lot to me.
sv	But I guess it's just one of those things where if that's what's something it's a need for them you know.
aa	No.
aa	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	But I don't think that we have a right to stop somebody from that you know
sd	I guess I get all mixed up inside. when, Yeah
sd	but they would vote pro choice.
sv	an abortion means it's somebody's in trouble and that it's an awful thing, you know
sd	I don't know if I could ever be a judge, because some things emotionally just aren't you know
sv	and it's really something how political ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also within within a,
sv	how it'll sway from one extreme to another.
ad	let's talk about schooling.
sd	and I have a young a young boy in that.
sd	So I have a lot of children in the school system down here.
sd	Like, last year, my son and daughter were in the same grade school before he moved up to middle school,
sd	I mean, it was a fire hazard if we had any kind of assembly there with parents.
sd	but in the meantime, the school still has lots and lots of kids in it.
sv	and secondly, when we have enough schools, sometimes we can't get the support for the teachers that we need to pay them to keep good teachers.
b	Uh huh.
ba	great.
^2	We see through out the country.
aa	I think that's right.
b	Yeah .
sv	It is so hard with a family system, either divorced or just one parent or just li ,
sv	and then, if both of them have to work, even that is a hard situation for the children, to have a supportive system around them to make school work for them
sv	and I think it's real important that the parents work with the school,
aa	I think what you said is really a pinpoint, though, that the student and the family life really adds or detracts what's happening in the school
qy	is she happy at school
ba	I bet she does.
b^r	right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qy	Do you want to go ahead?
sv	Well I think, you know, when I look at, all the things that are coming out now about over spending and spending money that's not there and buying things that are extremely expensive where they could buy it at a better discount,
^q	it's just unlimited,
sv	I mean, that kind of thing
aa	Exactly.
sv	and they're looking at what's the best buy.
sv	and you didn't care what you paid.
sv	Going to actually shop at Best Buy for, Best Buy is one of our electronic stores for fax machines, things like that, instead of going through these office supply companies that mark up their amounts and say, you know, I'll give you a legal pad for five bucks,
sv	and you can go to another shop and get it for maybe sixty cents or ninety cents
sv	that kind of thing
sd	and also I have one dependent has my daughter
sd	and I keep looking at well where's the so called tax, relief for having children.
sd	I mean, I think I paid just as much as when I didn't have her,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
sv	but you're still going to owe the government as much money
sv	and it certainly isn't going to be in their savings, account.
sv	Nobody's going to have the money to spend.
sd	so, I don't know where the answer is
b^r	Yeah.
sv	Now, we go through another election and listen to all these lies about the,
aa^r	No.
sv	It's candidates that have money
sv	and, you know, you're not going to get anymore Abe Lincolns around.
sv	Just like the communist government of, the old U S S R.
^q	we're fed up.
qh	Who knows
qy^d	Well, I was just wondering if you had had any experience with, the care of the elderly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's nice.
aa	No.
sv	It's really sad .
sv	It's really a sad situation.
sv	I, I guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever, you know, the parent is, doesn't always want the in law living in the house.
qy	Is that right?
ba	Well, that's really sad.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and they did for a long time. I couldn't, tell you how long, } until she got, where she had to have complete care,
sd	and so , they couldn't, you know, keep her in the house anymore,
sd	And I don't remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at that time just a block or two from our house.
sd	and we all went just constantly until she died.
sd	and you know, I don't, being so young, I don't remember why. You know, what was, why she had to go there.
sd	Well, I do remember that she was, you know, totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way.
sd	And that, they couldn't, they found that they could not you know, give her the hygienic care and everything that she needed.
aa	but like you say, there is a tendency for people to be abandoned, though, you know, in the nursing home.
sd	I do remember the other patients there, being real excited when we came to see our own grandmother, because they got some interaction with someone.
sv	If they're busy they don't you know.
sv	It's easy to abandon people, because we do have the nursing homes, I guess.
sd	But, anyway. Well, I'm, glad it worked out good for your family.
fp	Hi
fp	My name's Ken,
^g	right?
sd	Everybody else but one has been in Texas.
ad^t	well I guess we should get on with this.
^g	right.
qy	do you think that the Soviet Union represents a threat to us?
sv	I suspect they're not our biggest threat anymore.
sv	I suspect it's probably some crazy man like Saddam Hussein who's our biggest threat,
sv	and there's just so much military machine there.
b	Right.
qw^d	But I wonder how much longer they're going to be them.
b	Yeah.
sv	I mean, if, if something were to happen, I'm sure they would all of a sudden band together just for the sake of, of, of unity against us or something if, if need be.
sd(^q)	actually I noticed I mean, this, this, this most recent scare of his, where or he just decided that instead of having, I can't think of the word now, if there are any demonstrations in favor of Boris Yeltsin, he decided, well, I'll just cancel all demonstrations altogether.
sv	he, I think, is becoming very dangerous because he's making those people angry at him,
sv	and I think he's also making, the military angry at him.
sd	like with the Baltic states when they just go in there
sd	divvy the people up.
b	Uh huh.
h	I don't know though.
sd	sort of a military thing I was speaking of before.
^q	and we're to not let you do it, you know.
ba	that's real scary, actually.
sv	but it could be real dangerous.
sv	we don't need to worry about them.
qy	but wouldn't it be nice if no one had to fight anybody else.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think that underlying we're all probably not as different as everybody thinks.
aa	Well, that's certainly true of it.
sd^t	this, someone before, actually one of these calls
sd^t	one of these calls
sd	this, this poem, Everything I Wanted to Know I Learned in Kindergarten, or something.
qy^d	You've read that one before.
^q	and whenever we'd start a fight we'd all apologize and hug each other you know,
sv	If we could just do the same thing sort of, with, with everybody else, I suspect we'd be fine.
qw^d	Because I often sort of wonder how, having never been to the Soviet Union, how different the people there really are, you know.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sv	so it would be interesting to watch.
sd	the ones in like the Baltic states where they don't have a strong leader, then, you know,
sv	I mean they have Yeltsin who may yet sort of help Russia.
sv(^q)	I mean, they were taken over you know, not too long ago and then just sort of told, well, you're here now,
sv	I think it's a sad state of affairs,
aa^r	yeah.
b	Right.
aa^r	well, yeah,
^q	we want our piece.
sv	they have Muslims to deal with as well as Saddam Hussein.
^q	We just want this little tiny piece of land.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	yes.
sd	so I, also I know some of the history .
sd	We're sort of like the Middle East peace talks ourselves.
sd	and I know that it really is lots of different cultures in one place, I mean
sv	you can't take a whole bunch of people who just aren't the same people and don't want to be together and put them together forcibly.
sv	but they wanted to do it.
aa	that's certainly true.
qy^d	I wonder if now the people in the Soviet Union don't have ideas very different from that.
sd	but, I went two or three weeks ago for the first time in a long time and saw DANCES WITH WOLVES, which turned out to be an extremely good movie.
^q	this is not one that you want to do that with.
sd	it's just amazing, amazing picture.
sd	Well, this is the one for me this time.
qw	What have you been to lately?
b	yeah.
bh	Is that right?
b	Yeah.
qw	How's his karate?
sv	they get
sd	We wanted to jump in the cars and race.
sv	And I suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it.
bh	Is that right?
na	I did see GHOSTS.
sv	I think that GHOSTS was one of those that a lot of people didn't think was going to be any good.
sv	And it turned out to be an excellent movie.
sd	I've forgotten the guy's name who was in it, who had the lead role.
sd^e	and I especially like him.
sd	Other than that, DANCES WITH WOLVES seems like to be the only thing I've seen in the past several months to have any,
bh	Is that right.
sd	but I'm not real sure what it's about.
b	Yeah.
aa	That is a strange combination.
ny	Yeah.
b	yeah.
qy^d	Both of them.
b	Oh.
sd^e	years ago.
b	Oh.
qy^d	And then defend it.
qy^d	Well, I guess that's where the title comes from then.
aa	it is.
sd	we've got a couple of movies out recently, GHOSTS and DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, that have to do with, after life, I guess.
qh	Is it supposed to be better?
sv	We like those things that way.
sv	and there's no real way of finding out.
sv	There's only one way of finding it.
sd	and she really liked it.
aa	it is.
sv	and you never know.
b	Yeah.
sd	and it doesn't end like the story has been going.
fc	Bye.
sd^t	I guess tonight's topic is about recycling.
sd	And I'd like to tell you first of all what's happening in our community here in Plano.
sd	because I hate to see our landfills being filled up and, growing bigger and bigger and bigger where they are becoming a big problem for not only the people that are living today, but for the future also.
qo	How about your community?
br	Dye Mound?
b	Uh huh.
sd	Sounds like a place where I grew up .
sd	Well, I like it.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, good.
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sv	You can get in trouble for that.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	Well, it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack, isn't it?
bk^r	okay.
qy^d	until you release it.
b	All right.
b	Yes.
sd^e	I sure do.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yes.
b	No.
ba	That's excellent.
sv	and we might be able to incorporate some of that.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Oh.
b	Yes.
ba^r	that's a great idea.
aa	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
sv	Well, that's a full time job.
qy^t	do you want to start?
b	Uh huh.
qrr	Or even in, like they said, you know, lesser, you know, trials, you know, lesser convictions, do you think that they should be all unanimous still?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	So I don't know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets tired of fighting, you know, just gives in.
sd	And they have to stay in until they all agree
sd	but I do know for sure that all twelve have to agree before he can either, you know, either he or she can either go free or to jail, either one.
b	Uh huh.
qh	but I don't understand with racialism and the way religion is and everything else how you can get people that are totally impartial to it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qh	how many times have you heard of judges being bought over.
sd	and he completely, you know, goes the other way.
sd	Now, I'm not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or what.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	If there were more than twelve, can you imagine how long they'd be sitting .
sd	I mean, some cases go on for years, you know.
sv	Maybe maybe they should be asking someone that's been on trial before.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	so that is fair.
sv	I, I don't think anyone's going to come up with a better way.
sd^t	I think we can hang up anytime .
fc	I don't
fc	Bye.
qy	well, Pat, did you vote in the last election?
bh	you did?
qo	Well, why do you think, people don't.
ba	That makes sense too.
sd	I know that I've moved around a lot.
sd	In the past, three years I've had three different addresses.
sd	Each time I change jurisdictions or whatever.
sd	when I lived steadily in one community, I always, I voted.
sd	but then I didn't vote I guess, in the two year for, some legislators and things
aa	uh huh.
sd	and that's probably one reason why I voted in the the last election, but not really this one
sv	because this one really didn't matter that much.
aa	it's probably true.
sd	Well, you know, they also say that most people vote their local politics, that local is much more important than, national issues.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I definitely think so.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	that's true,
^2	Prepare them to be, victims,
b	Uh huh.
^2	Right side, of the tracks,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	because that got national attention, I guess, having a woman governor running against a man and whatever.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, you know, what's funny, up here, I see a lot of Virginia news
sd	and I guess, Senator Robb and Governor Wilder are active right here,
sd	and they have some type of wire tapping problem going on,
sd	see Robb is married to Lynda Bird Johnson
sd	and the people in Virginia are complaining that he's using Texas politics in Virginia
sd	because they said that We don't have that type of trashy politics up here like they do in Texas all the time.
sd	So you guys were getting yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know that, I'm previously from Pennsylvania
sd	and Dick Thornburg who's now the attorney general is going to run for senator because, John Heinz, a senator from Pennsylvania, died in an airplane crash
sd	and I know that they're expecting a gigantic turn out to landslide Dick Thornburg as, into the senate because they don't like the governor's political appointee, or whatever
sd	and they're almost expecting landslide turn out, right now for that election.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	was that when, you,
aa	that's true.
b	Right.
sd	Because those were big political, that was a big, turn out election.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I think that also happened with Ronald Reagan.
sv	He was he was landslided in
sd	and one is, four.
sd	and so I decided to hold off on my job for a while and stay home with them and spend some more time with them which I hadn't been doing.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I was teaching for Richardson School District.
sd	And, it just seemed like it took a lot of my time with them being so little.
sv	And it's really hard.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	but I felt like I really wanted to work.
sd(^q)	and , you know, it's like, do I really need to work, you know?
sv	but it's different staying home too, you know.
sv	It's an adjustment to make, also.
b	Yeah.
ba	Wow, that's great.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	Wow, that's great.
b	Uh huh.
sv	kind of goes on.
sv	They do what they see, you know.
b	yeah.
sd	Plus, you teach middle school,
sd	I taught early childhood
sd	so I had the little ones.
sv	and you know, you just it's, it's, kind of an eye opener.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I think you're right.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
aa^r	yeah.
aa	yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	I know exactly what you're saying .
sd	I was watching the soap opera awards.
sd	because every single woman in the audience is, about ten pounds.
sd	So. I started anchoring, exercising about last Spring, when I, joined the President's Health Club.
sv	but it is hard to go regularly for a long time.
sd	so I am not exercising at the moment.
sd	I just cannot do that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think a lot of the times, if you have someone to, work out with, or walk with, or something, it does give you that motivation.
sv	And I mean you can, you know, pretty much do it privately if you had your own private, sort of contest. You know where you would try and see if you could lose more weight than your friend or something like that.
sv	And that would keep you going.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	perky is a good word for it when you exercise.
sv	Better than running.
sv	cause it works everything
sv	Like, I understand running hurt your shins or knees or something like that.
ba	Wow.
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah.
b	oh .
sd	I guess my, favorite exercise, in the gym, is the bikes.
sd	and, I use to play racquetball
sd	and I really liked that, because, you know, to me it had a point.
sd	So, I don't do,
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	like you were talking about, walking at night and in the morning or early in the morning.
sv	you see a lot of, mostly older people though that, walk in the malls.
sd	I have never tried that.
sd	You know, I have never even thought about it really.
b	Oh.
qy	So, are you a news person?
b	Yes.
sv	great show.
bf	so the real current news and, the hard news is not, there is not really enough of it there.
sd	I end up switching stations from time to time.
na	in general.
sd	I watch a lot of C N N and C SPAN.
sd	I subscribe to three newspapers.
sd	you know, I sort of can't get enough of this.
sd	and when I travel elsewhere, I'm often amazed at the local papers how little they have. Of world events and national events.
qw	Well, in Dallas, what is the newspaper situation?
qy	was that the better paper
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	But if you were to look at the front page of today's MORNING NEWS MORNING TIMES rather, would you, would you see things about what is going on in Europe?
bk	Oh.
qw^d	Whoever Troy Aikman is.
bk	Okay.
ny	Yeah.
sv	I guess it's current events, but not the kind of current events that changes the world.
b	Yeah.
sd	I rather like the WASHINGTON POST.
sd	But, I also get the NEW YORK TIMES and the WALL STREET JOURNAL.
sv	and, each of them covers different things in dif , dif , in different ways
sv	and so you know, if I only looked at one of them I clearly would have a different perspective on the world.
na	that is certainly true.
sd	like a few days ago they had a nice article on Einstein, you know theory of relativity. You know, that started on the front page ran into almost full page inside.
sd	Now, these are feature kind of articles.
sd	all the, you know, the bulk of the paper certainly is about business kinds of activities.
sd	but there is some very good other articles you'll find in the JOURNAL.
sd	I wish it were in more depth.
sv	just more facts would be nice.
sv	C N N has, you know, was, was pretty good during the war.
sv	and they you know, sort of had a unique vantage point for doing that reporting.
sd	We went to the beach
qo	How about yours?
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	You're from Virginia?
bk^m	from Texas.
sd	I heard they had some flooding down there.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Not really rationing water, but just cutting down.
sd	but it's, changing latitude.
aa	yeah.
sd	but the sun has finally started popping out.
sd	I'd say it's at least seventy nine, eighty, well, about seventy eight, seventy nine degrees.
nd	actually the wind normally blows, let's see, let me think about this, south, southwest.
ar	but actually I guess our weather pattern blows north east,
sd	it blows north east.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	how far are you from Houston?
qy^d	so you don't get anything off the Gulf, immediately from the ocean.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Bangladesh, boy, they caught it bad .
qy^d	you probably heard about that.
sd	last year.
sd	and it usually comes this way .
sd	It comes up from, Miami down or, you know, around the Bahamas,
sd	and, it'll go up the coast quite a ways before it finally hits.
sd	and we knew what was going on, to, you know, go downstairs or go into the bathroom and, take cover.
sd^e	we're, we get our share of tornados.
nn	huh uh.
sd	We're about two hours from the beach.
sd	and we catch you know, a few winds coming off of them, I think.
qy	you all just had a tornado, over close to Oklahoma and Texas?
b	Uh huh.
ba	gosh.
bh	did it?
sv	That would have been something.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I used to live in Amarillo originally.
sd^e	especially in Borger, we use to sit out on our back, picnic table and watch them come out of the sky through the funnel clouds
sd	But otherwise we'd just sit back there and watch them go in and out of those clouds.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	but the clouds are just really, rolling kind of just real pillowy, I guess.
sd	well I was in that, big tornado went through Wichita Falls.
sd	I mean, we were right in the middle of it, when, I mean, signs and telephone poles were dropping all around us.
sd	And, it was a real eerie blue green color.
sd	And the lightning was almost continuous, just, you know, as if you put your hand on one of those electric, things that causes lightning.
sd	I think it was called the storm.
sd	But, the whole sky was full of that eerie blue green, lightning.
sd	but, when it rains, it's been downpouring.
fc	You, too.
fc	thanks.
ad^t	Get us going.
qy	are you at T I Austin
sd	so my daughter has talked to two students, that were non, T I ers.
b	yeah.
qy	have you retired
bk	Oh.
b	yeah.
qy^d	Well, you should have a lot of information on a budget, then, if you're,
sv	Well, you, you deserve an honor for that, a gold star for that, I guess .
aa	sure.
sd	the man always did the bills for, I don't know, fifteen years or more,
sd(^q)	or here's how you do the checks, you know.
sd	and I've been happy ever since.
sd(^q)	and I said, I've been a happy man since I haven't, fooled with that checkbook, you know .
sv	So I know it's a big pain to try to do that.
b	Right.
b	yeah.
sv	seems to be that way.
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you listen to radio talk shows?
ad	Listen to Bruce Williams, for financial advice.
sd	It's, it's five seventy up here.
sd	and, he gives a wealth of information, very practical stuff
sd	and he will help you avoid a lot of little things, financially.
sd	And I'm not expert, again, because, I don't really do it monthly.
sd	I have one again at U T down there now, her first year,
sd	and she's almost gone through her whole college fund, you know .
aa	Sure, go ahead.
b	Sure.
sd^t	they give us ten minutes,
ad	and you ought to, well, as your daughters approach the college age, start finding out about the scholarship monies because there is a lot of money out there
sd	and, of course, if you, you score high on the S A T, you can get, you know, two thousand a year, you know, or more.
sd	It was only five hundred, dollars at a clip from this organization.
sd	She applied and got five hundred dollars from that.
ad	So, look into that bit,
sd	and they don't even have a dozen applicants because, the kids are going off after the big money.
sd	so, There's money out there.
sd	I don't want to, I want to chew up the whole line here.
sd	I call this my recession job.
sd	And I'm working nights just kind of covering, shutdown equipment and everything, and just being available, here.
sv	And, you, you got to be a little flexible.
sd	I'm trying to study for that now.
b	Right,
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Right.
b	sure.
sv	Well, it's tough right now for everybody.
sd	I've got another clue for you for college.
sd^r	Another clue for you for college money.
sd	we have a friend who is a secretary for T C U, you know, up here?
sd	They give you scholarship, a hundred percent, if you work for T C U.
ad	So check that one out, you know.
ad	Call them.
sd	Now, it's, not room and board,
sd	but it's tuition, full tuition paid if your parent works at T C U.
sv	and it's sometimes a very, it's a very hard juggling act.
sd(^q)	and I keep saying jeez, I don't have that much time with her .
sd	And she's growing fast
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
aa	Exactly.
b^r	sure.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah.
b	Sure.
b	Yeah,
sv	and that's part of it too.
sv	and it's nice
sv	because our financial situations are as, it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now
sv	and you're not getting any further, you know, along
sv	and it's a tough one.
b	Uh huh.
o	Okay.
bf	kind of like a domino's effect.
nn^r	No.
sv	I think people just started, you know, not being as careful with the loans that they were making you know, whenever they gave them out.
sv	or maybe because everyone else was doing they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also
b^m	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
no	I'm not sure.
sd	I'm a finance major here at Clarion.
sv(^q)	because they were like well, we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it.
sd^e	I don't think so.
sd	and like some banks, you know, they're limited to the types of loans that they're allowed to make.
sd	And I think the S and L s were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make.
sv	And I think if they would be more bound to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve, then I don't think this would have happened.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and I think it will be for awhile.
sv	I don't think how they could find how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose, because there still are some S and Ls still open.
sv	And it's very possible for them to go down in the future because of this.
aa^r	uh huh.
sv	but I think there are some regular banks that will go down with it.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but they just wrote off like millions of dollars because they know they will never get it back.
sv	it's impossible to get it back.
sv	cause we're, you know, we're talking about some peens that have just like even gave up on like getting it back and trying any more.
sv	They just totally wrote it off their book.
b	Oh.
sv	as long as there's enough little companies we're going to have to have something.
aa	Right.
aa	Uh huh.
aa	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I think it could happen,
b	yeah,
sv	and I think there is a chance of it possibly happen again but not until, you know, late, you know, in the future.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I work as a news reporter,
sd	this is my first job
sd	and another day I'll be on camera,
sd	so I'll wear a pant suit in case I have to shoot.
sd	I don't really like dressing up at all.
sd	I don't wear a lot of makeup or anything like that.
h	and I don't know .
sd	I don't mind it at all.
b	Okay.
qy^d	White pants in a bakery.
ba	Wow.
bk	Okay.
qy^d	Italian I guess.
sd	that's one thing I would like, is just to sort of have, I really don't like uniforms but, } just to have something I don't have to get up and decide what to wear.
sd	That just bugs me to death.
b	yeah.
qy^d	Sweats and.
sd	when I was in school, I was a sweat monster.
sd	and when it was time to go out, I didn't have anything to wear.
b	Yeah.
sd	If I didn't have to have shoes, I wouldn't have them.
sd	and they're just tedious
sd	I wear size nine
sd	and I just wish that I could just go without them.
b	really.
b	Oh.
sd	and I could then I would be able to dress more business like and things like that,
sd	but we're all kind of just out of school at this station,
sd	and so we're all, you know, still in sweats, really.
sd	So, it's pretty fun though.
b	Yeah.
sd	they come like with a mini type skirt you know, and the jacket.
sd	but but I'm pretty short,
sd	but I think it looks good on taller people.
bh	Are you? .
sd	I mean, I have like two pairs of pants, because I can never find any that are short enough for me
sd	Pants, too, I could do without those.
sd	Pants, shoes.
sv	those are nice.
sv^r	Those are nice.
sd	They're kind of big and hefty tennis shoes.
sd	And it's just like a chore to pick up my feet. Because I'm used to wearing the little white girl tennis shoes.
sd	The little ones.
b	Yeah.
sd	And I'm used to those.
qo	So , so, so how do people in Wisconsin dress?
b^m	Warm.
sv	Like five pairs of socks and,
b^m	Yeah.
qy	is it doing any good?
b	Uh huh.
sd	Wish our post office could do that .
sd	I wish they'd just deliver stuff.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I agree.
sv	and I don't think we should cut the money.
sv	and, I think they lose sight of probably what they're supposed to be doing.
ny^r	yes.
sv	and, you know, with Russia, seemingly not going to be as big a threat.
qy	Have you gone out to, Fort Worth to see the Soviet space exhibit?
b^r	uh huh.
sd	They have done a beautiful job.
sd	and the loading of it
sd	It is really interesting.
sd	We got out there about, ten, ten thirty,
sd	and one child gets in free.
qy^d	You have teenagers or something.
sd	they really did like it.
sd	because they had one of those moon vehicles and had it so it looked like it was on the moon, and showed it moving around and stuff.
sd	So it was really neat.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	I was thinking about camping and people's ideas about it.
sd	and they got the big old antennas up so they can watch their T V when they're going.
b	Yeah
qy	Do you go camping?
sd	In fact, when we first got married, we would try to take these trips to Minnesota to see his family
sd	so we'd sleep on those picnic tables at roadside parks.
sd	And this ranger comes up with this light, shines it on us and said that we're just bear bait out there. We had our food you know. } and told us to get inside our car.
b^r	Bear bait.
b	Yeah.
sd^e	We've got some land at Holly Lake outside of Tyler.
 sd	Sometimes we get a lot of people together to do it.
sd	but we've got the fans going.
sd	So we're not roughing it too much.
sd	And we have taken T V s out there for the kids .
ba	So it's not so bad.
sd	I think the longest we've stayed out there is like five days.
sd	And they had a library at one time out there.
sd	but we have gone on trips where we bathed in streams.
ba	That's kind of different.
sv	And a pool to go to.
ba	That would be nice.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well my husband has even camped at Lake Lavon with one of his friends
sd	he just decided to take the kids out there.
sd	But they had the time of their lives, you know.
sd	Had the boat just pulled up right by the tents.
ba	It wasn't bad.
sd	And most of the time we decided we wanted to stay in a hotel.
sd	Instead of getting out all that stuff, you know.
sd	Then you have to get up the next day and move it on.
sd	We decided that was easier than cots and more comfortable.
qy^d	Those double ones?
sd	We're on our third one I think.
sd	We've got an electric pump that hooks into the cigarette lighter.
qy^d	I didn't know you could do that.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	I hope you didn't have a big vacuum cleaner.
sd	Now we've used a hair dryer before.
sd	But I put it on hot and also melted it.
sd	I found that you don't do that.
sd	I didn't realize it would melt so easily.
sd	I don't know.
b	Yeah.
sd	I don't like it when there's mosquitos so bad.
sd	It was just that bad, you know .
sd	And we decided we'd just go across the road to the office and see if we could rent anything.
sd	and it was wonderful.
b	Yeah.
aa	it was.
sd	It's horrible.
qy	You mean that you put on a truck or what?
b^r	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qw^t	How many weeks have you been doing these calls?
qy	So do you work for T I?
qy^m	In a Speech Lab?
qw	And what exactly are they going to do?
bf	So any voice, no matter what the speech pattern or the dialect or anything.
qy^d	I wonder if these are going to be speaking . The computers,
ba	that's kind of neat.
qy	Do you put all the uh huhs in here on everything, too.
qw	What do you write for stutter?
b	Uh huh.
ad	You need metal instead of plastic.
ad	And you make sure that you keep up with them for the next time.
sd	and you just put them together.
sd	And it's a dome tent.
qy^g	That's good isn't it .
b	Yeah.
nn	no.
sd	I've done it in a shelter.
sd	It was in Padre Island and in a truck off Corpus, not, but not in a tent.
fc	well, that's about all .
fc^m	Okay .
fc	Uh huh.
sd	and, the taxes that I pay, I guess as a general statement, I feel I guess I get my money's worth for.
sv	I guess I am sure that I feel that, in general, though, the allocation, of the taxes in certain areas, isn't correct.
sv	and I'm not really sure that we've gotten our money's worth there, regardless of the outcome of the Desert Storm, Desert Shield, situations.
sd	I take that as a given in any military operation
sd	but, I'm just getting nervous again, now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area.
sd	I do worry about what nuclear weapons are left in their territory over there, and who's controlling them,
sd	I don't know what amount of, our hardware would stop some fanatic, I guess, from doing anything, that would be irrational.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qw	what is the name of that?
b^r	yes.
sv	I see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down, the roads, the highways.
sv	but I guess overall, because I guess I'm not associated with what ghetto schools, and, and, rural school systems are like, I should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure.
qrr	or is it all funded out of local taxes?
b	Yeah.
sv	Sounds like the way the federal and state system works now.
b	Yeah.
qy@	do you mean a complete reversal? Because, I guess, they can't raise that money in those poorer districts,
b	Yeah.
sd	I have, a, a, a background of, getting my college education through the G I Bill.
sd	I don't think I would have gone on, unless I had that financial easement made possible.
sd	or I guess the enactment of that form of legislation, would give many people who, I think, I think I perceive the fact,
sv	but I guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year.
sd	They went from eleven to fifteen hundred,
sd	I don't know what that would be.
sv	and, the states don't have enough money
sd	I'm not too sure of that reasoning.
sd	in Germany or in England in some cases people in my income level, at least, allege that they pay up to fifty five percent of their gross income in taxes.
sd	now it costs me money to leave the country, some sort of a tax to leave the country, some sort of an airport departure tax, a sales tax which is getting to, quite high levels,
sd	I'm not sure that I'm not up fairly close to that.
qy	You really think so?
sd	I pay quite a bit more taxes
sv	but that's been a Republican government for the last ten years.
b	Yeah.
fc	Don, good talking with you.
fc	Bye bye.
fp	and I'm calling from Plano, Texas.
qy	would you like me to go first?
sd	it's a preschool
sv	I guess you can classify them all together.
sd	some of the qualifications that I look for was you know, the cost, and, exactly what they did, if it was structured or nonstructured, if they had a little academic, in there, and, you know, you know, what the qualifications of the teachers' were, and if the place was clean and the hours
sd	and, just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff.
ba	congratulations.
b	Right.
qy^d	Or staying home.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and that's where Shannon had started, in a Mother's Day Out program
ad	and you have to make sure that you apply pretty early, because a lot of places have very long waiting lists.
ad	and another question to ask is if they're, state certified you know, if the teachers have, their Master's degree in child education and child development.
sv	when your child's a little bit older, like a three year old you'd be more concerned with if there's a type of care that it's torture for them to lay down and take a nap.
qh	Is there like a mandatory nap time?
sd	and the other ones get up and go do something else.
sd	So, she doesn't have to necessary take a nap there you know, which is nice.
aa	That's true.
sv	and sometimes you even consider, you know, having a private person come to your own home when they're real little or or something like that,
qh	and another consideration is what's the ratio of teachers to to children
qh	just your child, or do they just put any child in any crib you know,
sv	you would want, maybe, your child to have their own sheets all the time, and not have another child use that bed you know.
sv	I'm sure that, whatever you decide, you'll be happy with.
sv	And it's exciting time to have a new one .
ba	that's wonderful.
b	Uh huh.
sd	some places, start them as early as, I think, well, some, some places take them as infants, I guess, you know, like eight weeks, even.
sd	you know, some places just specialize in just real little ones
sd	and then other ones, are the older children.
sd	I think the last thing I did of any significance was change the water pump on an Oldsmobile.
ba	I know what you mean.
^2	or fuel injected,
sd(^q)	and I said that means that I can't work on it.
sv	You know, they've gotten so complicated or so high tech that, average guys can't really go out in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs,
b	Yeah.
aa	Absolutely.
sd	it was a short van, that had the three fifty in it.
sd	and you didn't have all the other junk around it,
sd	and you could get to it to work on it.
sv	the hardest part about, water pump changes is getting all the junk off, before you can get too it.
sd	and I don't think I had too many nuts and bolts left over when I got it all put back together.
b@	yeah. Yeah.
sd	I don't think I'd know where to start with a diesel.
sd	and, we used to overhaul farm tractors basically,
sd	but as far as cars I've never, never been involved with them.
sv	and you can get to them.
b	Yeah.
sd	I don't notice it, probably because I don ,
sd	but maybe because I'm not looking for it.
b	Yeah.
qy	But you got the three fifty in the van?
sv	and, if you treat them right, they're not the gas guzzlers I think that they've got the reputation to be.
sv	I'm convinced that, Detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake, years ago when they stopped putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes.
sv	I'm convinced that the small V eight like the Mustang's original two eighty nine or some of the Chevy two eighty threes, were good little V eight engines that were not gas guzzlers
sv	but they had enough power t , pull all this weight.
sv	And the four cylinders just don't have it.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think those little V eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines, if they would have gone with it,
b	yeah.
sd	it was a three seven or something like that,
sd	and there was basically nothing in there but an engine, and a few things.
sv	Now, you open the hood and it's scary.
aa	Like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to.
sd	It's one of those transverse mounted V sixes, front wheel drive.
sd	And he'd never really thought about it.
sd	it's going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall.
sd	So they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them.
b	Uh huh.
sd	the anti smog pumps.
sv	And all that stuff loads the motor down.
sd	and it's got one, belt on it a serpentine belt.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I've got an, an Olds Toronado that, I think's got six belts on the sucker.
sd	And I had to get all those off, you know, when I was replace that, water pump.
sd	And, I had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where.
ba	man.
sv	everything else's got to come off first.
fc	so I guess I've done probably, I'd say seven or eight of them.
fc	so I don't know, if it's tapering off, or what.
fc	I had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting, answers.
fc	maybe they're burnt out or,
fc	Thanks for talking.
sv	national health insurance, I think, is a problem inasmuch as the quality of health care that people would receive.
sd	stay in line for, four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor.
b	I see.
sv	Well, I think that, again having gone through a period when I was out of work and had to buy health insurance on my own, if you don't have a company picking up the major portion of your health insurance, the cost is almost prohibitive.
sd	but for dependent coverage I'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars a month or something like that.
sd	They're probably picking up about half of it.
sd@	or one of, whatever the type name is, H M O, where you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest. If you tried to buy something like that, it would probably be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	that's right.
ba	goodness.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	As to a company's benefit, to have a program like that because it keeps their employees healthy and on the job.
sv	Because they don't have to worry about going in and paying, seventy five dollars to have the doctor look at you for ten minutes.
sv	But here again the doctor's practices in hospitals, have become fairly sizable businesses under themselves now.
sv	you have to pay your share of the operating of that eight story building, when the rooms are empty.
sv	and, that's how you come up with aspirin that costs four dollars apiece and things like that. The horror stories that you hear about people going into the hospital for a week and, it being, a four thousand dollar bill.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	he'll be three in August.
sd	And, their insurance plan that they're under encourages you to shorten your stay in the hospital.
sd	and she was out in two days time.
sd	And it was treated almost like it was an outpatient visit to the hospital,
sd	the deductibles didn't apply.
^q	if you'll shorten your stay then we will, waive the deductible.
qo	well what do you do on your yard?
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Comes back in the yard
qy	You do it yourself?
sd	we do too.
sv	A flyer's on every door every day.
sd	but I keep putting off learning.
sd	and so while my husband was painting I went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at Calloway's
sd(^q)	And I went, Well, now you tell me.
sd	I haven't gone out to check yet.
sd	And we did not know in August to put down the, whatever it is for grub worms.
qy	Have you ever seen it what grub worms do?
sd	so the most careful thing we do on our yard every August is put down that Diazinon.
sd^e	we found them
sd	and they said they turn into black bugs in the spring
b	Uh huh.
sd	They said that every yard has some
sd	So that's the number one thing we do, whether we fertilize or anything else, just because we got burned so badly before.
qy	two years ago, or last Christmas is that what you're talking about?
b	Yeah.
sd	It's what they've done in the spring or the fall.
sd	because I started to say, there's different times they say it's okay to do it.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
sd	and they just live,
sv	you can stand those.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	And every year we learn one more thing that we didn't know before. Like about these mums.
sd	next year, I'll do pansies.
sd	so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants and brought them to the front door and the back door and laid them on the patio.
sd	and if there's anything he'll hurt, we just don't put it out there any more.
aa	Very much,
b	You did.
b	Uh huh.
sd	So do ours,
qw	What did you grow?
ba	That is amazing.
b	Yeah.
ad(^q)	and you say, well, I made it though, at least it's mine.
sd	but I do have a personal computer on my desk here.
sd	it does the things I need for it to do.
sd^e	it's not even that.
na	I think that's about where it is.
sd	I do, some Lotus on it. do some, Samna, some, P F M, nothing extremely complex.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yep.
ba	I bet that's a pretty nice setup.
b	Yep.
ba	Wow.
b	Yep.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	So, I can never quite stay current with that.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I can bel , I can believe that.
sd	I'm not that up be on that sort of thing.
sv	well, it sounds like you're pretty much into computers.
sv	Well, it's been interesting.
sv	of course, needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing.
qy	is that the newest thing now, the four eighty six?
bf	that must be a fairly recent release.
sd	but I didn't know they had a four eighty six just yet.
b	Yeah.
fc	and you have a good day.
fc	Bye bye.
qo	How about yourself?
qy^d	you have got, young children then.
ba	That is great.
qy	A boy and a girl?
b^m	Two boys.
qy	Do you know what is on the way yet?
ba	I do not blame you .
sd^r	Well, we have got two boys and a girl .
sv	maybe you will get lucky and get a girl this time.
sd	and the Navy is sending him for his Masters in Ocean Engineering
sd	So, we have got, still, all sorts of good activities since,
sd	so she goes out riding as much as she can.
nn	No .
sd	She rides English, and does jumping, takes lesson and all that kind of stuff.
sd	well it is a program for Advanced kids.
b	okay.
sd	So, it keeps them busy.
sd^r	It keeps them busy.
sd^e	well you probably know a peace group that are advanced type. That they are special, well, classes for peace classes.
sd	history is what their peace class is this year.
sd	she enjoys that kind of stuff and, does well with it.
ny	Yeah.
sd^e	Always something to do .
sv	I guarantee it.
b	okay.
ba	That will be fun.
aa^r	yeah.
ad	Got to wait a couple years.
ad	Tobogganing.
ad	You have got to go tobogganing and sledding with them.
sd	Well you are welcome to keep that .
sd	and when I was a kid,
sd	but we use to take all of the kids tobogganing and ice skating, and all of that kind of stuff
sv	it is fun really.
sv	As long as you do not have to drive in it.
sd	but keep it off of here .
aa	Yes.
sd	Well, you have got, You have got five months before you will see that .
sd	I think I'm down to one.
sd^e	I was pulling your leg.
sd	the way I'd like to try and use it is, you, you make your purchases at prime buying time
sd	and then you pay that off and don't use it until, it's paid off.
sd	that's my ideal way .
sd	and I and I use it.
sd	like, my car, had a major problem, seven hundred dollars,
sd	and things just come up
sv	and you just never get to use it the way you'd really like to.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and I was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble
sd	so we just disposed of them, paid them off, and got out of it.
b	Yeah.
ny^r	yeah.
sd^e	Well, now we pretty much just pay cash for as much as we can there.
sd	so and I have that for automotive purposes.
sv	it's just too easy, basically, just get yourself in trouble with those.
b	I see.
sv	and then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit
sd	and if I can get one that'll keep my limit at five hundred and I can never go over that or something like then that's fine,
sv	eventually get's up there to ten thousand, whatever fifty thousand
sd	I don't want that.
sv	writing checks is just as easy I guess.
fc	Yeah,
fc	or you don't like them.
fc	and. And, then, maybe we'll talk again.
fc	Yeah.
fc	Texas is the big one.
fc	Well, bye now.
sd	I've, read a lot of the, the, astronomy books and, and stuff like that.
sd	I haven't kept up as, much as I would like,
sd	I've just been so busy,
sd	I barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then,
sv	but I'm probably getting a little too old for that.
sv	I think a lot of our technology we have is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel, equipment and stuff that,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and and, you know, he talks a lot on Velcro.
qh	i , what would we do without it? .
b	Yeah.
h	I don , I don't know
qh	it's also just I've often pictured, in my mind, you know, what would you find if you just kept on going?
sv	I guess our minds are so, what is it? finite
sv	when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object, and it's hard to see, you know.
sv	It's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely.
aa	Yeah.
sv	I think it's in people's nature to be the first to do something.
sd	And I'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like, you know,
b	Yeah.
sv	I think that's what made us, progress to the state we are is our curiosity.
sv	A better place to be or whatever, you know
sv	So you are always looking for something better.
sd	and, it's, I'm always looking for something better.
sv	There's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it.
sv	and, you know, just because they don't talk about it or something like that.
sv	And they are doing it you know, unconsciously.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qy^t	Was that you, that we didn't hear the whole prompt?
sd	and, I was thinking about it after I got off the phone, that I really, you know, wish that there was some way to, send a message to people, you know, about, child abuse and things like that
sv	Too often I feel that people get off, without,
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	right,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sv	well, sometimes they even wonder when, criminals plead temporary insanity for punish , for crimes that are so severe and then, you know, they get sent to a mental institution
sv	and then they're back out in public.
aa^r	I agree,
sv(^q)	well, she looked like my mother who abused me when I was a child, or something, which I think is, unfortunate for that person and yet shouldn't be an excuse.
sd	and I was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some Miss America was abused by the man she loved
sd	and that kind of worries me with my kids only being under two and not having, you know, to deal with that yet,
ng	Never
sd	anything can go on in California.
b	Yeah.
aa^r	uh huh.
no	I really would have no idea. I don't really know.
sv	that would be pretty lenient in my opinion.
qy^c	are you there?
qy^t	Do you know the question for today?
qy	Do you think this is vital important?
bh	Do you,
sd	I don't know.
qy	Well, can you come up with anything else that maybe we could do to these people?
bd	that's all right.
sv	the only thing is if they don't vote, they have no right to complain.
sv	and then if I'm unhappy with it, I have the right to express my opinion.
sd	But they have been little more effective in Oklahoma with having this program that you vote or you lose it.
sd^e	three.
sd	you have to skip three.
sd	And, of course, they can be, a long time apart
qo	and this is not one of our questions but what do you think of this no excuse absentee balloting?
qy^d	I'm sure all over the State of Texas now you have three weeks to go for absentee balloting.
sd	Anyone can go and vote.
qy	Do you?
sd	But that is an excuse I could live with.
sv	If you're busy, that has always been a legitimate excuse. If you are incapacitated, ill health,
sd	and I don't know why we couldn't have duplicate voting on some of this.
aa	I know.
qo	So, how do you feel about capital punishment?
b	Right,
sv	and then other times, you don't know.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sv	so I think sometimes they'd prefer just to get it over with
sv	so it's more of the easy way out than making them pay for the con , for the you know, what they've done.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but then again, also, you can't bring back lives that have been taken anyway,
h	I don't know,
aa	It doesn't bring back every,
qw	What state are you in?
qy	In Dallas?
bh	really?
sd	but I'm from Plano, Texas.
qw	So, what are the laws like in Texas?
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
nn	no.
qy	And they do it that way?
b	Huh.
sd	I'm not really familiar.
sd^e	I am.
sd	and one of them has the real gun in it.
sd	So they don't know who killed,
na	Right.
aa	no.
qo	how do you like it?
qw	what kind do you have? .
bh	Do they really?
bk	Oh.
sd	and they never mentioned that problem .
sv	They probably just take it for granted then.
ba	yuck .
sd(^q)	we kind of have an understanding that, I said I'll do inside work you do outside work.
sv	And so I get into the gardening part of it, the fun part, like putting in the annuals and things like that.
sd	But I don't like it dirty .
sd	Today we just had a lot of rain .
qw^d	I don't know how yours has been.
sd	this is going to be a switch for us for a week going down there,
sd	But, as far as the gardening and things like that goes I don't know, too much about, how much I really do enjoy it myself.
qy	Do you like it at all?
qo	Well, how about when you were in Colorado?
b	Uh huh.
ad	And, if you have that on a regular basis in Texas, I think I would go with something very dry to keep it off, you know.
qy^d	and with children, you probably don't have time anyhow to get into it.
fc	Right.
fc^m	Nice talking with you.
^h	let's see,
sd	I'm twenty.
qw	How old are you?
b^m	Older .
bk	Okay.
sd	but I'm from Plano, Texas.
bh	really?
ba	wow.
sd@	My dad used to work at U T D also. generally we just go on family vacations to Arizona.
sd	That's generally our usual summer vacation.
sd	Tempe.
sd	so we go swimming
sd	They're up there also, my grandparents and my cousins.
qy	have you?
ba	my goodness.
qy	Around Christmas time?
bk	Oh.
ba	Wow.
bh	really?
qy	So, do you travel a lot
bk	Oh.
qy^g	So you know a lot of good vacation spots,
qy	That's your favorite?
qw	where do you live?
ba	Wow.
na	I do.
nd	I work for NuSkin .
ny	Yes.
bh	really?
ba	my goodness.
ba	Great .
sd	maybe the rejuvenating cream is the only other thing I would use.
qy	Than the intensive eye?
b	Uh huh.
aa	yes.
sd^e	we get free products every month
sd	now I'm getting about sixty bucks a month, free products
sd	I've worked there about a year.
sd^e	they're wonderful to work for.
b	Yep .
qy	Uh huh.
ny	I ski, yes.
sd	Actually since I grew up in Texas I've only been here about two years and have gone skiing about well, five times each season.
ny	Yeah,
ny	Yep.
sd	I do like to ski.
sd^e	I said I do like to ski.
sd	And it's kind of nice being up here just because it's all like a vacation in itself when you get to go.
sd	If you like that kind of thing .
sd	I am actually a junior. Beginning of my junior year.
sd	Nursing.
aa	I know.
aa	I'm not.
qy	And it was great?
qw	How long did you get to stay there?
bh	really?
qy	did you grow up in the farm.
bk@	I see, well little bit different.
sv	I think though it was much slower and, much more self contained.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
sv	unreal by comparison.
sd	I can remember as a child, you know, nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where I wanted to go.
sd	it didn't occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me
aa^r	no.
qh	It's not all that long ago is it .
b^r	uh huh.
sd	we were living in New Jersey. twenty years ago.
sd	In Allendale .
sd	And, I use to have to go over to Patterson when those riots were going on, sometimes.
sv	though the news media had those riots, kind of blown up out of proportion.
sd	because I went there many times
sd@	I never saw a riot. Did you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think the other thing is that, we have taken some rather drastic turns in our education and the way we approach things as of maybe starting back when I'm number one, you know, and, worrying about self and not, seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family.
sv	and there have been many things that have happened that have not encouraged closeness of families and, support for young people the kind of support that they need, to help them take care of the things,
sv	if you don't have some kind of basic believe or something down inside of you, then it's very difficult to, have anything to turn to, when you've got something facing you like that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	exactly.
aa^r	that's right.
b	Oh.
sd	I see some flickers of, of good directions turning,
sv	but whether they're soon enough and fast enough I don't know,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	that's right.
sv	And there's so, so many people on the lower end of those who are going to be the drop outs and the, and the poor and the homeless and whatnot,
aa	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sv	it just is almost overwhelming sometimes when you think, of the jobs that is out there to be done, in order to flip things back around the way they needed to be,
sd	not that I really think that they were perfect ten, twenty, or thirty years ago,
sv^e	just the volume makes a big difference,
sv	it's just the volume of it, to try to keep all wash done and all the things done you know, and everything.
b	Right.
sv	Right and, and children's lives were simpler because mother was there,
sv	somebody was there.
sv	and when there's nobody there,
sv	but I believed after having a few teenagers that the worst time you could go, to go work was when they were teenagers.
sv	but it's that you are there when they need you.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	I think that's true.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
qy^d	But that helps a lot,
sd	and he opted to go into a day care center where she could have her children with her. and looked a long time before she found one that was laid back enough so she would be able to interact with them,
sv	I don't think people realize how important it is.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
bk^m	Linda.
bk	Okay.
fc^t	Well I think probably that we've just about .
fc	I'm going to, change the world
fc	it's nice talking to you, too.
fc	Bye now.
qw	music do you like?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I am more into rock and roll myself.
b@	Uh huh. Uh huh.
qy	Do you like any bluegrass?
bk	Oh.
ng	Not really .
b	Yeah.
sd	I have a lot of friends that like country music .
sd^e	I'm more into, older rock, like the psychedelic era, like,
nd	late sixties, seventies,
sd	Greatful Dead, Crosby, Stills and Nash.
bh	What ?
nd	I've heard a little bit of it.
sd	now I've heard of Striper.
sv	the first of Amy Grant before
sv	you know, became more mainstream, top forty.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	I imagine that she puts on a pretty good show.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I like some country music.
^q	Mama got run over by the train.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Like Garth Brooks.
qy^d	Reba MacIntyre.
qy^r	You don't like Patsy Cline.
sd^e	actually I just went to see the Greatful Dead I guess about a week ago.
sd	They have been touring, since the late sixties .
sd	They're still making albums.
b	Uh huh.
sd	In fact, I mean there are people you know that basically just follow them around, from city to city on tour selling tie dye and things like that.
sd	but you know like whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement .
sd	and the new ones in this thirties you know.
sv	but it looked like leather day at the geriatric,
sv	All their faces were just all shriveled,
sv	I mean it just just looked like they, got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans.
ng	Actually, I prefer my performers to be pretty sober, you know, just so you know, that if they're jamming, you know, that they don't just lose themselves and you know, go into lala land.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	So I really don't have a problem with it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I honestly feel if people have nothing to hide, they shouldn't have a problem with it.
sd	Not only with themselves, but with other employees.
sd	they're talking about sports and sports personalities and all this stuff that I would much prefer having doctors and airline pilots tested on a random basis.
sd	So I really have no problem with it.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
bh	really?
sd	if I were a dentist, I'd want to be protected, too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, where you're located, I do know Texas Instruments has random drug testing.
sd	I'm pushing our company towards that. .
aa	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	It's too free.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
qo	So, how do you feel about the crime in your city?
b	Uh huh.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
sd	San Jose, California.
sd	Here, you know, the real problems are the gangs.
sd	but in comparison to Colorado, it's real noticeable.
sd	I mean I won't go to the grocery store at night.
sd	And it's that kind of thing
sd	We have a neighborhood watch program in the development that we live in, which I think is a great way to reduce, home theft, burglary, and things of that sort.
qy	Do you have that where you live
b	Uh huh.
ba	no.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, you know, also I've heard that, the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home. Like on the weekends.
sd	I think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is, spent doing yard work outdoors.
sv	and then they just slip in. Slip in, slip out, you know.
sv	They know exactly what they're going for.
sd	So, I've heard that's really on the rise as far as you know, a new type of crime.
b	Yeah .
aa	Unfortunately, yes.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	is that what you did in your program? Where you have a list of license plates?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah. Well.
sv	You can have the house alarm, neighborhood watch program, you know, as a woman not go out at night
sv	you can do that which is what I choose to do.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	if you kill someone in your home, as long as they are in your home, it's considered self defense though.
bh	It isn't?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really.
b	Yeah.
sd	mostly it's been because I didn't like the color,
sd	or, I'm not sure whether I've had to return that many things,
bh	are you?
ad	so, we'll talk about that some.
sd	but for the last four or five years I've had eye problem,
sd	Shopping is no fun anymore .
sd	and it's just aggrav ,
sd	I just thought of something we have to return .
qy	okay? .
qy^t	Are you ready?
b	Laurie, all right .
sv	I think that sounds fascinating.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yes.
b	Uh huh.
ba	lovely.
qy^d	the computer was supposed to have two.
b	I see.
sv	They probably didn't know what they were talking about.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh .
ba	jeez .
aa	it really is.
sv	and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction.
sv	I think that's the worst part.
qy^g	Now that's an advantage, isn't it?
sv	It, how , it gets you some muscle where you need it.
sv	And I think that's really important.
aa^r	That's right.
aa	No .
aa	They will,
sv	they will put the kind of clout on them that you can't really do.
sd	but to keep her entertained, music and some of these things do help.
sd	And I thought well, if I had, a nice little, tape recorder, you know, so that I could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while. And then also so that I, I do some musicals and things like this and if I can copy sections off that I can use someplace I figured well this will be good.
sd	and the next thing I knew the tape was chewed up in the, thing.
sd	so after that then , you couldn't get a tape to play at the right speed in that side.
sd	and so you can't get it to run the right way, either,
ng	I really don't know which brand it is.
b	Yeah.
sd	and we're going to just take it back
sd^e	just, one of the major, I think it was a, you know, I don't, I think it was, you know, like a Highlands or something like this.
qy	Do they have Highlands up there?
sd	Well, this is was a regular, electronics store, you know.
sv	I think they deliberately sometimes,
qw	what, for instance, what are you,
ba	That's good
b	Yeah.
aa	I think that's right.
sd	I've known people who have had Toyotas for years that have had almost no repair work to do on them.
sv	but they don't have to take them to the shop every other day.
b	Yeah.
sv	so, part of it is that we need to develop more of a pride in, the kinds of things we do so we make them better.
sv	And it kind of has to start from the top and go clea , or from the bottom maybe and go clear up.
b	Yeah.
sv(^q)	Attitude is just get me my dollar so I can go do what I want to do, and, on,
sv	There isn't, any way to get paid enough.
sv	so whatever you're paid is enough.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right,
sv@	is. Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand that there is value just in work for itself without any pay, you know.
sv	The, the, the that the value is in doing it well
qw	Jay, where do you live in Texas?
b^m	In Dallas.
qy	What's that, the I Thirty and Central express?
bk	Okay,
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
bh	how about that?
qy	It's a new home?
b^m	About eight years.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
sd	Well we we live in a brick story and a half,
sd	Cape Cod style, I guess you'd call it.
sd	And, have a big sun room on the back of it.
nn	No,
ng	it doesn't have .
qy	With openness and light?
sd	I would love that too .
sd	this is very traditional.
b	uh huh.
qy	Do you have children at home?
ba	boy.
qy^d	You still need space, plenty of space .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It's, about twenty five hundred square feet, I guess.
sd	It's four bedrooms and two baths and that,
sd	It has one wing built on that's a kitchen family room, and then the big room on the back.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
qy	I was just reading an article, that there were nineteen thousand properties available in Texas, for sale by the Resolution Trust Corporation?
sd	Repossessed .
sd	I, I guess so.
sv	That's discouraging if you own property .
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well our daughter and son in law moved back up here. He's from Texas, but course she's from here, about a year and a half ago, and had their house on the market down there,
sd	and she got her job back, and he got a job down there.
nn	Huh uh.
nn	Nope.
sd	They live in Rowlett.
bh	Have you?
b	Uh huh.
qw	What college are you teaching at?
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	The only one I know is Richardson .
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
fc	Well I enjoyed talking to you.
b	Right.
fc	same to you.
qy	Well, Steve, did you go to college?
qy^d	So you probably could give some great advice.
qw	Well, what's your interest,
sd	I'm in a P H D program right now.
sd	But my area of expertise is, human computer interaction.
sd	And I think that's one reason why I'm part of this study, because I'm working with voice systems.
qw	what, what type of advice do you think you'd give to a parent?
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think that's more important probably than even the career vocation, because most people change.
sv	but some of the small, some of the larger small schools, you know, I guess around three or four thousand students can offer a broader range of curriculums and things,
sv	I don't know, they don't have to give up years you know, of credit transfer and things.
sv	I think most employers would probably rather hire, you know, a three six in history, to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration.
qy	Does that make sense?
sv	I always, you know, tell them that you should major in something you're going to get good grades in. Because that's always, I think, more important, you know, overall.
h	I don't know.
qy	you're at the office now?
qy	At work?
na	I would, it would,
sd	and then right now I'm teaching part time at a Catholic institution.
sv	but I think you can also get a bad education at public or private, you know,
sv	I think the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what to look for.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qh	does it have a big ten football team
qh	is it a PAC ten school, you know.
sd	that's the big one with the football team.
sd	you know, when I first was applying for graduate schools, I applied to some big programs, you know, in this area, like Stevens Institute of Technology, which is recognized in the Northeast as, you know, one step below M I T in a sense, you know,
sv	so it's got big name recognition in this area, a big science school, no football team, but a big science school,
sd	so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of,
sd(^q)	you know, but then when I went, for graduate work, you know, or for a new job, people said to me, you know, Shippensburg State, where is that, you know .
sd	And, you know, when I went into higher education, even at other universities, they weren't aware of it, you know.
sv	you need that first, job or so out of school, too.
aa	yeah.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah,
o	Okay
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I agree .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ba	I know what you mean.
sd	and I went through the T I fitness center and registered for the, aerobics classes there.
sd	so that was four and a half hours a week.
^q	that'll encourage me to always go since I spent that much money.
sd	and then I was having to work some real late hours to get caught with my work after I got out of class.
sd	and, boy, I tell you what, I've been terrible ever since then.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and some of them require me to go out of town,
sd	and, that just kind of throws my whole schedule off on doing that.
sd	and I've found excuses, things like I had the flu last week,
sd	and I didn't.
sd	and so I haven't had that extra motivation, of us forcing each other, or not forcing each other but encouraging each other to go.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm the same way.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I do too.
b	Uh huh.
sd	There's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex.
sv	And it's not as boring if you get several people
sv	it's a lot more fun than some other things I could do, I guess.
sd	and after I get finished I feel great.
sd	it's amazing how much better I feel.
sd	And then just in general, I sleep a lot better
sd	and I know if I would just get around to exercising I'd feel better.
sd	But my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising.
^q	so I better not go .
sd^e	it really is.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	I don't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands.
sd	So I think a Tuesday Thursday might be a little bit better.
sd	Of course, I feel like once I've done it, if I'm sweaty I might as well do an extra thirty minutes , because you've already kind of shot your night.
sd	But, so I'm kind of glad they have a longer class on Thursday now that I can just kill two nights, and and, get a reasonable amount of workout in.
sd^e	it's less expensive.
sd	But I'm glad it's not too totally cheap, because if it was too cheap I would talk myself out of going more, probably.
sd(^q)	Since it's more expensive, I think, Okay, you spent that much money, you'd better go .
sd	So hopefully.
sv	But, I guess, sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	I think if I had to come home and then go somewhere, I'd never make it.
sd	And just the fact that I can go straight from my desk over to the recreation center and do it helps a lot.
b	yeah .
sd	For me, I wouldn't have time to do an hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get dressed again.
sd	But there's a lot more guys that do that one.
sd	I've never done that one before.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	They've got the full weight room and, the locker rooms with, a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities, and hair dryers, and you know, everything you'd need just about.
sd	But it is very nice.
sd	I mean, I'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing.
sd	and it's about eight dollars a month.
aa	not at all .
sd	but, I think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced, from what I've heard.
br	Hm?
qw	So, what was the last car repair you had?
bk	Oh.
qy	Did you crack the block or what?
sv	You got lucky you didn't ruin the whole engine though.
sv	That can be pretty serious.
sd	it's been about a year.
sd	I had the water pump break on my car.
sd	I was going on my way home from Thanksgiving
sd	and it broke like in the middle of nowhere.
sd	So, I had to get it towed and then fixed
sv	big pain.
sd	Luckily someone came by and gave me a ride.
b	Yeah .
sd	so is mine .
sd	So when I cross that one I'll be okay.
ba	that's nice .
b	Yeah.
sv	and it's not worth it .
b	Yeah.
^q	It's not worth it.
ny	Yeah.
sd^e	we get some killer winters up here in the mountains.
ny	Yeah.
sv	Lot of snow and a lot of cold.
sd^e	at times there's a lot of it.
sd	You got to like clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance.
sd^e	I haven't had a big problem with that though.
sd	So I've been pretty lucky there.
sd	You just rinse it off after the winter is over and done with it.
sd	I usually like to do most repairs on my own though.
sd^e	just because that way I know what's wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really doesn't.
sd	Plus if something goes wrong, I know who to blame.
bf	More fun things to do.
ba	Well, that's nice.
b	Yeah.
sv	One is bad enough .
fc^t	I was just wondering that .
fc^t	I didn't either.
fc	this must be a hard category.
ad	Why don't you go ahead and start.
qy	So you think if trials were held by judges or experts, that they would tend not to convict people on circumstantial evidence?
sd	and, that's the sort of system they have.
sd	They're experts in the law
sd	The judges do the questioning
sd	I think I prefer the jury system myself.
sv	That's where you really need a jury of peers. Because, anytime the government, is the government against the individual y , you need the protection of ordinary citizens.
sv	I guess I don't think that, juries need to decide sentencing all the time.
sv	I think maybe a judge is a better judge of that
sv	That's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe.
sv	But people who don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are, to ask them to decide for one case, on one person, based on what they see, I think that is maybe, a little bit naive.
sv	In Texas here, people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people.
sv	it's kind of, a hanging jury atmosphere .
sd	some cases in some jurisdictions, they can do that.
sd	I kind of like that system.
b	Yeah.
sv	And lawyers blow sand in their eyes.
sd	I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries.
sd	Insurance cases and things like that.
sv	and, there would be more honest settlements instead of this, tugging of people's heart strings and, making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering .
qy	well, do you have a pet?
sd	Your two fish.
sv	you know, how, sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing.
sd	So we have a black Labrador.
sd	but to me, he belongs up in the field, you know, in the ranch, in the farm
sd	and there's nothing you could say bad about him, except that I was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle.
sd	but he does.
sd	And the worst part that I had with him, he's three now was when he was, about eight months old
sd	and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall.
sd(^q)	And so, he said, well, puppies just chew when they're nervous and well, I wish you had told me you know,
sd	and he looked at me like, you know
sd	and I'm very comfortable,
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
qy^d	She's old.
qy^d	then you broke your heart.
bk	Oh.
bk	Oh.
ba	Bless your heart.
sd	That makes me feel so bad.
ba	no .
ba	no .
sv	I never heard of that before.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Or the smell or something.
bd	Uh huh.
qy	Well, now, does your cat sleep in the house?
qy^d	they are house cats.
ba	good.
sv	See, it doesn't do anything.
b	See.
b	Yeah.
ba	no.
aa	that is.
sd	Well, I'm not either.
sd	I'm not either
sd	And then my daughters both have hamsters.
sd	and I gave in at Christmas
sd	and they just sleep and eat bits of apple and carrots and,
sd^t	I think they're cutting us off.
b	Oh.
b	okay.
b	Okay.
b	okay.
ba	I understand.
aa	Okay,
sd^t	they'll cut us off pretty soon.
aa	I know.
qy^d	Salt water or,
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you have annual family reunions
qy	Were they like all in Dallas?
bk	Oh.
b^r	uh huh.
qy^d	Just from city to city then .
b^r	uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
qy	Do you go back?
qr	Is it choice or just business
ny	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you have brothers and sisters?
qy	And, is your mother still living?
^g	Would you not?
qr^d	I mean, either way there was family reunion time, or not,
^2	Relatives,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	right.
^2	The next generation,
qo	why do you think that it's less close than it used to be?
b^r	uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	we get so involved in our work lives and just, social lives and so forth.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It really makes an effort to, do this anymore.
aa^r	right.
b^r	right.
qy	Do you correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother that's in that group? On a regular basis, not just Christmas cards.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Right.
b^r	right.
sd	They had chosen Santa Barbara, California for this summer and did not get enough people that were willing to go that far, because most of us live either in the midwest, or like in the Texas, Oklahoma area.
sd	but we have a family letter, that circulates,
sd	You have, read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth.
sd	So, you are kind of, half way acquainted that way.
sd	And that, that's been a, that's been a nice way of keeping us all aware of each other, I think.
sd	I sent it, on to the next one,
sd	and, but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one, in Scottsdale, Arizona, for that family.
sd	I'm Nevin from Sunnyvale, California.
fp	Pretty good.
aa	Yep.
bk	Okay .
sv	Well I definitely think, like decisions have to be unanimous.
sv	It's probably the safest thing.
aa	Yep .
sv	And even like, you know, two thirds majority, I mean, it's ,
aa	Yep.
sv	Like Gives them a little too much power .
sd	but you know, it may be for technical reasons .
b	Yeah.
aa	I know .
sv	there would be much more of that .
sd	But I . I tend to follow it just to know what's going on.
sd	I do too
aa	No.
sd	I know a little more about civil cases than criminal cases. Which is,
sv	it's more in how you present it versus, you know, who's right.
b	Yep.
sd@	When I was, a couple of years ago, involved in some pretrial stuff and / * slash error?? one utt with a.57
sd	the opposition will say this, this and this and ,
b	Yep .
sv	And it's like the truth isn't really important anymore.
b	Yep.
sv	people don't want to take responsibility.
b	Yep .
sd^e	Well originally from Chicago
b	Yeah.
aa	I haven't either other than,
sd	I'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better. .
aa	I know.
sd	And if it's criminal cases you can't put them in jail because there's no room left.
b	Yeah.
aa	Not at all.
qo	What do you think?
sv	At this stage it's hard, to tell.
sv	Well, at this stage I think we've taxed property almost to the limit because, like the property taxes on the homes have reached the point that it's precluding people from being able to own a home because of the cost of the taxes on them.
sd	I live in Richardson
sd	and it's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house.
sv	and if it weren't for the taxes we're putting in there, look what the schools could cost you.
sv	and the public, colleges also, the tuition has got to be among the lowest in the country.
sv	Well if you double the tuition, it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states.
sv	That would provide, possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things, see.
sv	but eventually I think you may tax people out of smoking even.
sd	so I, I couldn't afford to start again .
sv	But all the various taxing authorities that come through, I think the one tax I resent the most though is the additional sales tax for DART which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime.
sv	If we had been like a Chicago or a New York City or Philadelphia or someone like that, and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and, construction costs were cheap, you could afford it.
sv	But now, digging tunnels under Central Expressway and things like that becomes cost prohibitive.
aa	Absolutely.
sv	just take like in Chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere.
sv	and some, people don't even own a car and know how to drive a car.
sv	Well, most Texans will jump in their car to drive across the street.
sd	And I'm just as guilty as anyone else.
sd	I drive to work every day by myself, without even any thought of car pooling.
sv	And, most people are that way. Because they're used to not having public transportation.
sd	So, but I, here again I think I resented where they were collecting the sales tax for five years before they turned a spade of dirt. and doing all these studies and the things
fc	Well, that's about all I can say at this time.
fc	it's been real nice talking with you.
fc	Bye.
sd	they just raised our taxes up here about a year ago.
qy^g	Indianapolis got that, didn't they?
b	Yeah.
sd	so they're trying to lower them.
sd	they just keep raising them.
sd	and they're going to lower it for next year.
sv	I guess they figure they're going to make up for all they didn't get when they should have had a budget.
sd	but I'll see.
sv	I think they're paying too much.
qh	Why bother working?
sv	Well, they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make.
sv	That would be fair.
sv	Everybody pays ten percent or fifteen or whatever.
b	Right.
sv	I think it's pretty fair.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh .
sv	so you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and you don't have it to give it to them.
b	Yeah.
bh	Really?
ba	Ouch .
ba	I'll say .
qo	Well, what do you think about it?
sv	I don't think it's going to change very much
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, you know the funny thing I find about American opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before, the American public goes crazy.
sv	And now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in Iraq, they're going crazy.
sv	You know, I mean you can't please them one way or the other.
sv	It has nothing to do with us.
sv	And until he starts doing something so inhumane that the U N gets involved, then it's nobody's business.
aa	I mean, yeah,
sv	and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years.
sv	And it's going to continue.
sv	As long as you have so many diverse groups that are vying for power, it's going to happen all the time.
sv	They've gotten their butts kicked,
sv	and this is just another time that it's happening.
sv	and they'll try it again in a couple of years.
sv	and, and I don't have any doubt that through some back channels we encouraged it. You know.
sd	But, I'm not real sure that we promised them anything.
sv	that would have been stupid,
sv	I don't think they would have done that.
sv	This is just a, another chapter in Middle Eastern history.
sv	this is really nothing special.
^2	it's mostly religious anyway.
b	Yeah.
aa	exactly.
sv	I mean looking at it from the American public's standpoints, they don't understand the Middle Easterners.
sv	It's religion couched as politics.
sv	And there's a big difference.
sv	and we think that they think the way we think.
sv	And that's a big mistake, because they don't.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I was stationed in Turkey for a year and a half.
sd	And it was tough, understanding those folks.
sd	You know, they, they're, they're so completely different culturally and socially and and religiously,
sd	it was very strange.
sd	It was very interesting.
sv	shoot, I think some of these people that they claim as Middle Eastern experts don't have a clue sometimes.
sv	You know they sit there and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert.
sv	Well, I'm not real sure that's appropriate.
sd	that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country, too.
sv	And we make experts by reading books.
sv	You know, and the Japanese and the Germans and everybody else make experts by doing.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	I, I guess you work for T I.
qy^d	So you guys are well aware of the problems with the Japanese markets and everything else.
sv	the only reason our car industry hasn't gone down the tubes is because the Japanese, you know, came into it and helped, us out.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but it's going to get even worse later.
sv	I mean looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the, the math and the science and everything.
sv	It's not us.
sv	You know, we've got folks running around here who get degrees in basket weaving and you know, underwater psychology, or some ridiculous stuff like that.
qh	and where are the engineers coming from?
sd	it's human factors.
sd	His degree was in, industrial engineering.
sd	and he's from the Philippines.
sd	And the only reason he came here was because the education is so much better for those who will go after it.
sd	He has no intention of going back to the Philippines because there's no jobs.
sv	I mean we've got loads of foreign students
sv	and then they're going back to Korea and Japan, and Hong Kong and everywhere else
sv	and they're applying it there.
sv	we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think it's, it's sticking your finger in the holes in the dike.
sv	Well, let's plug it up.
sv	It's far beyond me.
sv	all we can do is keep plugging.
sd	I read in the paper just last week, I B M's unveiling their new laptop computer.
sv	Well, at a price tag of six thousand bucks, I don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers.
sd	now I , I have the I B M, P S two
sd	but I'm sorry I got it.
sv	there are many better machines on the market right now for a,
sd	the only reason I got it is because I got it through an educational purchase plan through the school
sd	and I saved forty eight percent,
sd(^q)	so I said, yeah, if I can have an I B M for forty eight percent discount, I'll take it.
sd	But up to that point I had always said I would never have one because I wouldn't pay that kind of money for their name.
sv	just sure as anything, the Japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price with more stuff on it.
^2	It's already outdated.
sd	years ago, I remember when I had a T I ninety nine. Put all the money into the expansion box and all this, that and the other
sd(^q)	and I finally said, well, you can't do this .
^q	You've got to buy something and stick with it,
sd	The only thing I've done to it is just add a mouse and a hard drive.
sd	I got the model twenty five.
sd	so it doesn't matter.
b	Yeah.
sd	He's got a three eighty six and wants to get a four eighty six. You know, this kind of stuff.
qy^d	so you said that you live in Coppell.
qw	So what is your house like?
ba	well that's neat,
qr	is it one you're renting or buying?
sv	well that's kind of neat that you can even though it's a duplex, you can still buy.
ba	That's good.
qy	Do you have any children?
sd	and our home is really too small for us right now .
sd	we moved from an apartment that was really small,
sd	and at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old
sd	it's in one of the older areas of town
sd	and one thing I really like is it has big trees everywhere
sd	but the house is real small
sd	it has less than a thousand square feet
sd	it's real little.
sd	the one that was five months old is seven years old
sd	and I have another one that's three and a half and have all these clothes, and toys and stuff that we're just trying to find places to put,
nd	Well, they advertised it as a three bedroom house because it has a built on addition room, you know
sd	but the room that's built on doesn't have a closet
sd	so, the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom
sd	but we have always just put like our computer and extra toys and books and
sd	But it sure is nice to have it when the kids come over to play
sd	they all go out there to play with the Barbies and that kind of stuff,
sd	and so, } you know, they can share a room and, make for more space that way.
sd	She's three and a half
sd	so, and right now we have their clothes on, like double racks, you know, in the closet
sd	we made a higher and a lower
sd	but they're just about to get too tall , where the dresses are beginning to drag you know,
sd	But we're kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home hoping to be able to do that within a year or so
sd	so that would be nice.
qy	is Coppell a nice area to live?
sd	Well, I think I've heard a lot, about Coppell schools, that they're real good
qrr	or are you not planning on having any,
qy	Well, do you have any pets?
b	yeah.
qy	Well, do they stay inside,
ba	Well, that's neat.
qw	Well, what are the colors in your house?
qy^d	I bet that's pretty.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I like cows, too.
sd	our house is very old also
sd	it's like thirty seven years old
sd	it was redone at the time probably when earth tones were in
sd	like, the carpet's kind of a tan and brown and has, paneling in the living room, and lots of tans and lots of browns
sv	but the good thing is you can bring out other colors from that
sd	in the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan, wallpaper had done it up with blues,
ba	so that's nice,
sd	It's close to my, oldest daughter's school
sd	and that makes it really handy, too
sd	and she really likes her school,
sd	and we are so close to shopping
sd	I've always imagined it kind of away from everything.
bk	really,
ba	well, that's nice.
ba	wow,
bk	Oh.
bf	but it does sound like it's definitely growing.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, when we first moved here, we moved here from Lubbock
sd	that was our second choice, yeah, behind Garland,
o	Okay.
na	I can go ahead and start,
sd	but, you know, I'm real concerned that I don't want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that,
sd@	some places do have guard gates that you have to get through, or electronic access gates and things like that. Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	yeah.
sd	There's a lot of that going on in Dallas, too.
sv	it's really sad.
b	Uh huh.
sv	so they get lighter sentences,
sv	and some of those people, they don't deserve to be let loose.
b	yeah.
ba	my gosh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's terrible.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	it's a little more understandable under the circumstances, I guess.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	So let their country take care of it.
sv	well, I guess we do have a lot of people come in from Mexico, that cause problems,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I went to the Far East, back in October to do some training for T I
sd	and I thought Tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people,
sd(^q)	And they said, it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway
sd(^q)	I thought, boy, in America, if you left a purse on a subway, you would never see it again.
aa	that's true,
sd(^q)	But I was thinking boy, in Dallas, if somebody asked me if there were places you wouldn't go by yourself at night, I'd have to set them down for about five or ten minutes to list all the places out.
sd	They said, apparently the crime, is, just,
sd	and they really enforce it,
sd	They're just very tough on criminals.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	and if they're overcrowded, well, you know , they shouldn't have gotten theirself there in the first place.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I agree, because it's not fair to those of us that deserve a safe, you know, life to have to,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	not much.
ba	and that's really sad.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ad	What, go ahead and tell me about your home .
bh	is that right? .
ba	that's interesting.
ny	Yeah.
bd	that's okay .
b	Okay.
ba	that's neat.
ba	Wow, that's large .
b	Uh huh.
ba	well, that's not too bad,
ba	that's still fairly new.
qy	Well, do you mind if I ask what it's worth down there,
bk	Okay.
sd	I mean, from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand .
sd	although right now it's a lot lower , because of all the layoffs and everything
sd	the economy around here is real poor .
sd^e	not really .
sd	the area itself, the Fort Worth Dallas area, has become kind of depressed because there's been so many layoffs with big companies, including Texas Instruments .
sd	but housing is still real bad .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ba	Wow.
qy	it was overdeveloped then?
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah.
sd	but it is a home.
sd	It's on one floor .
h	I don't know,
sd	this house was built in seventy four.
sd	and his house is almost identical to us, except his is three bedrooms and ours is four
sd	there were probably, like two or three styles you could choose from .
sd	and, that's pretty much all the houses in the area, for probably a square mile, I'd say, at least, maybe even a little bit more than that.
qy	are you close to Sevren?
bk	Okay.
sd	I have a sister that used to live in Sevren.
sd	and when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand .
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Sounds like a lot of money though ,
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	Wow, that's,
qy	That much of a difference?
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah .
qy	Do you know?
b	Uh huh .
bk	Oh.
bk	Oh .
ba	Wow .
fp	Hello
fp	Hi.
fp	I'm calling from Texas.
sd	Took long enough to find you.
qy^t	so did you hear what the topic was
qy^t	did she tell you,
qy^d^t	well, if you're ready, then, I'll just go ahead and start.
sd^t	well I guess we're supposed to talk about the changing roles of women.
sd	and I like it the way it used to be.
b	Are you,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qw	how many kids do you have?
qy^m	Two?
qy	Are they young,
sv	and I hope it just doesn't get to where, you know, there's more and more women going into the work force.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and you kind of feel little bit like an outcast for a while in social situations sometimes,
sv	but I should get paid at least double what my husband makes working in an office for staying home
sv	men don't treat you like you don't know anything, generally speaking.
b	Yeah.
qw	So, what kind of home repair work have you done?
qrr	Been pulling them up, or just loosening them until the rain came in?
qy	Are you in the section of Texas that's been getting so much rain?
bk	okay.
qy^g	But you're probably, about halfway across the state from San Antonio, though, aren't you?
qy^d	But you're still getting a good bit of the rain, though.
b	Yeah.
qy	Is it asphalt shingles,
sv	that should be a lot of fun.
qr	Did you put them up originally or just going up and stopping leaks in them?
b	Yeah.
sd	we're in, campus apartment buildings with flat top,
sd	They're just tar and gravel treated flat top roofs.
qr	Have you got pretty well pitch on that roof, or is it pretty steep?
qw	What do you use to keep from sliding off that rascal?
ba	I imagine.
qrr	or you been doing some remodeling work on it.
sv	That's pretty new house yet.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	It's settling unevenly?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, that sounds like a lot of fun.
qy	What is it like, stucco walls or,
bk^m	drywall.
qy^2	Wood framing?
bk	Okay.
qy^d	they plastered over drywall.
sd	I remember my parents home is drywalled and then they, almost like a small grade stucco type plastering over the drywall to give it a textured sort of a look,
sd	and made for kind of a hard shell on the drywall.
sv	that would be terribly exasperating to have the slab floor like that swelling and giving like that.
qy	so, do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	but, do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think there's a lot they need to learn, you know, when you get there.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	you know, it's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time.
b	Uh huh.
b@	Uh huh . Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I don't see why it makes a big difference the C I A because, you know, officially they don't have any operations within the United States other than administrative.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
o	So I own a P C A T at my home.
sd	and she uses it to compose and print out letters.
sd	So that's a very regular use of it that she has.
sd	I'm a computer scientist.
sd	And also I'm interested in writing some programs that will kind of like remind me of things like remind me that Wednesdays is trash day and the like.
b	Uh huh.
sv	there's really two issues to that that there's so many software packages available today. That just require no programming.
sv	but if they were careful, they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works.
sv	your issue is then there really,
b	I see
ba	well, congratulations on that.
sv	well, actually one other thing I might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap.
b	Uh huh.
bf	the calculators you mean.
sv	You can actually buy a whole brand new computer not a necessarily a slow one or inadequate one but a pretty good one for six hundred dollars.
nn	No.
sd	so make it seven hundred.
ny	Yeah.
ny	uh huh.
sd	you can buy the guts just the guts with the power supply, the box and the mother board of a type of computer called an eighty, eighty eight, for about two hundred dollars.
sd	and then the disk drive is two fifty.
sd	probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one is there's a magazine called COMPUTER SHOPPER.
sd	it's twelve inches narrow, the narrow side and seventeen inches the tall side
sd	and they're all competing with each.
sd	it's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards, the main computer, the circuit board.
sd	They're available in, you know, the B Daltons, that type of thing.
sd	And like I said it's about an inch thick .
ba	There's great.
b	yeah .
b	that's great.
b	Yeah.
ba	that's a good joke.
sd	and just recently I've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing.
sd	but I don't use it anymore.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I agree.
b	yeah.
ba	that's fascinating.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yes .
fc	nice little conversation with you Jack.
fc	Good day.
qy	Is it ?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qrr	or is it pretty natural ?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
qy	Do you work during the day?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qo	So what do you feel are the current trends in the way families spend time in general, you know, in America?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and we're you know, thinking about having children sometime in the next couple of years
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	But I do feel like it's important that you make the time for children because ,
b	Yeah.
sd	and, guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've got my Texan stereotypes in place.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	It's pretty power isn't it ?
b^r	Okay.
sv(^q)	That applies to anything as well as guns.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
x	,
b	Yeah.
sv	you just told me that you're going to get one of those guns anyway.
qh	So why have any restrictions at all?
b	Yeah.
b^r	Uh huh.
aa	but, I certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility to know how do, use it safely as someone learns how to drive, if not more so.
qy	does that, mean advantage?
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	San Francisco, Bay area.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	What if you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon?
b	Yeah.
sv	if everyone walking around carrying a guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
qw	what if you think someone's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake?
sd^t	Well, that, that was the topic.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well as someone who would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander, I feel more comfortable with people having blades because, you're not going to get bullets flying around killing people instantly
qy	Are you a player?
bh	Has it?
bk	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I work at T I.
sd	I guess I laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits.
^q	Let's go around this tree, and you know, try a slice through a hook here,
sd	and I can't do that
sd	and I hope I'm on the right track.
sd	Shot a career low eighty nine, and my handicap is twenty nine.
sd	I like that.
b	Really.
sd	but she wants to get into it now after I came home and won the tournament the other day,
sd	she's she's ready to get off into it,
sd	and I'm a hunter and fisher anyway,
sd	and it's not going to cost me an arm and a leg, really.
sd	I don't ride
sd	you know, I get a little exercise there, too,
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sd	They were amazed.
sd	so. But, actually I picked it up when I was in high school, on the same as a P E course, you know,
sd	when I got into the service I got into it
^q	but I haven't swung them in quite a few years.
sd	and it just seems like every couple of years I get back in there .
sv	It's really nice.
b	Yeah.
sv	you don't want to go out and get beat to death,
sd	And then, you know, we've got some guys here that they are, you know, four and five handicappers
sv	so. You know, but get somebody around your own handicap, and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time.
sd	and never yet have I met anybody on the golf course that wouldn't allow me to join their twosome or threesome.
sv	They are always friendly.
sv(^q)	they don't mind saying, Well, you know, let me tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that, or,
sv	You know, it's pretty nice and friendly out there
sv	and you can't find that in all sports.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
sd	it runs from like five o'clock to seven thirty or eight o'clock, you know, because it doesn't get dark until nine thirty or ten.
sd	It's going to start, well, when we change time back whenever that is next month, I guess,
sd	and, you know, they were shooting a hundred, hundred and twenty
sd	now they're down into the hundreds nineties,
sd	so, it won't take her long. You know,
sd	she could care less about that.
sd	give her something to do that we both enjoy,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	you don't have to be an expert to play,
sv	Any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right.
sv	So, you know, you don't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and I didn't get it done.
x@	, I never broke a club or anything,
sd	but, you know I'd get upset about it sometimes,
sd	and now I guess, you know, being in my forties, I just kind of mellowed out a little bit.
sd	I don't get upset any more.
fc	I guess I'll go back to work.
fc	See you later .
fc	Bye bye.
qy	do you have any pets?
ad	go ahead.
qw	what kind is it?
qy	he's got a blue tongue?
bk	Oh.
sd	but I just love them to death.
sd	But, our Chows, we've had them, I'd say, right around six maybe seven years
sd	She's had about four or five litters.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Goodness.
sd	And, , bringing them in as puppies they got along just fabulous with her.
sd	now I don't know how it would be bringing in, like cat to a full grown dog.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
aa	I think, so, too.
sd	Five .
sv	I think a lot of that, that we hear all the time is how you bring them up.
sd	but they're very friendly, and lovable,
sd	they'll just come jump on your lap and want to have their bellies rubbed and everything
sd	and the male is black.
sd	so, it was kind of like, she had her babies and understood about, you know,
sd	and they love her,
b	Yeah.
sd	and I hate that,
sd	in the past, we've had birds, too, like Cockatoos. And parrots and, The big white, birds with the orange crest on top.
sv	they're very messy, yeah, , and loud.
sv(^q)	a dog you can tell, stop barking, you know, or whatever.
sd	but they were neat, enjoyable animals to have.
b	Uh huh.
sv	with a lid, .
b	yeah
sv	and in your, the luck of keeping them alive, through those first, you know, few days.
aa	I know they are.
aa	no.
sv	like you have a little bit of ocean with you or something .
sd	my daughter had like a little goldfish, about a year or two ago
sv	you can just look at it.
sd	You know, you can't roll around and tussle around with it like you can a dog or a cat
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba^r	no.
ba	and that's hard.
sd	I love having them for that reason.
b	Sure.
aa	that is hard.
b	Oh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
ba	fun.
ba	no.
ba	no.
qy^g	I guess you didn't get your deposit back, did you?
ba	good.
ba	Bless your heart.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	it is.
sd	Our only problem with our Schnauzer, she's an indoor dog , most of the time ,
sd	If you do not pick the trash up, you know, the container, and put it on a table or chair or something, she'll knock it over,
sd	it's just she wants to get into trouble.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I hate that.
^q	you shouldn't have left it there.
sd	and she'll cower and go hide under the table.
sd	But she continues to do it,
b	Uh huh.
bh	is he?
qh	Where to start.
sd	I didn't think about that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and you wonder, well, who's going to get ahold of this and think, that's a nice place to go rob .
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	carpet cleaning .
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	no .
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	but I find that very annoying . The, mail stuff,
sv	but it's not nearly as obnoxious as the phone calls.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	oh.
sd	and I can call them back .
sd	but now with this thing I'm participating in, I kind of have to answer it, because you never know if it's the switchboard or if it's, you know, somebody calling that you really don't want to talk on the phone.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Ours is that way, too.
qy	, isn't Tigon , part of G T E or vice versa or something like that.
sd	that's what we have.
qy	Aspen?
sd	I remember reading in the paper a few months back
bk	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
sv	that's good .
sv	but, I guess it's close enough .
fc	Bye bye.
b	Yeah.
sv	It's that time of the year.
sd	So we're spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things. But. like to keep up to date too.
sd	since I got out of college, which was about five years ago, my T V viewing started to tend more towards, documentary, news programs, things like that.
sd	I've kind of gotten away from, being a series watcher, having to keep up to date with,
sv	that makes a big difference.
b	Okay.
na	yeah, I started, too, and, kind of worked away from that.
sd	I have a hard time sticking with something like on T V, because, like, it gets real aggravating if you miss it, for a week or two.
sv	You feel kind of left out .
b^m	But, right.
ba	I believe that.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
ba	I know exactly how you feel.
sd	when I first moved down here, moved into the apartment and got cable, I guess I kind of became numb.
sd	And then all of a sudden, I started paying attention to network T V again, once in a while.
sd	Right now we don't have cable.
sv	And it's surprising how much it's changed
sv	It's really tough to find something that's going to be good and interesting for the kids. even cartoons,
sv	and kids aren't even going to understand half the humor that's in there.
sv	none of it's probably damaging, lot of times.
b^r	right.
aa^r	yeah.
aa	That's right.
aa	Well, that's true.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show.
qh	You know, why do you do this to yourself?
b	Yeah.
b	Okay.
b	Right.
ba	Now there's an idea.
b	yeah.
ba	That's pretty good.
no	I can't handle it very long.
sv	If half of the time wasn't spent watching commercials, it probably wouldn't be so bad.
sv	you're missing an awful lot.
sd	I'd personally rather see a game on T V than fight the crowds at the stadium.
sd	I'll sit down for the big games, the Super Bowl, and the championship you know, things like that.
sd	But I don't follow any team.
sd	But, I like good humor once in a while.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah.
sd	if there's any series that I pay attention to, I try to watch CHEERS once in a while.
aa	it is.
sd	In fact, I think it's on tonight .
sd	I just got in from outside,
sv	and I consider that fairly intelligent humor. You know.
sv	they pick up the words every once in a while.
ny	Yeah.
na	I try to.
b	Yeah .
sv	It's gone through cycles.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
b	Right.
sv	Well, I guess there are a few things around still
qy^d	Sounds like you pretty much agree.
fc	Been, good talking to you.
fc	Okay.
fc	Bye.
sd^t	We're supposed to talk about crime in the city.
qy^g	And, seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays, doesn't it?
sd	economy's so bad .
sd	That's just what they quoted over the news.
sv	but, it does seem up
qw^h	What kind?
sd	we have two, the MORNING NEWS and the, TIMES HERALD.
sd	it's a locally owned paper.
sd	The HERALD is owned, I think, by the TIMES out of, L A, or somewhere.
sd	but there is too much of it, you know, too many homes broken into.
sd	last year sometime our home was broken into.
sd	and, because we live on a corner and back up to a real, highly traveled main street.
sd	but since that happened, I certainly have.
sd	It's, I guess , excuse me, just a standard. , with all the doors and the, infrared you know, motion detector.
sd	Pre , Pretty standard.
sd^e	It's monitored and all that.
sv	I think, the thing that makes a lot of noise would suffice.
sd	But, this deal that was part of it for, you know, three years or so to pay the unit off or whatever.
sv	to answer your question, I think, I think, that is a pretty good deterrent in itself,
qy	Uh huh.
sd	Well, it's got a back up system that doesn't work supposedly. that if it's cut supposedly it notifies them anyway . Supposedly.
sd	And I think it probably does these things supposedly pretty good.
sv	Boy, they sure advertise so many of them nowadays.
qy	But, well don't you all have a pretty high crime rate up there?
h	I don't know.
bh	Is that right?
sv	I would gather probably from drugs.
sv	And I think that's the reason it's so high everywhere.
sv	but they do.
sd	We've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it, as anyone, you know.
no	I really don't.
b	Yeah.
sv	And, I'm not sure that anything will because if something could happen to make these people not want to buy it
sv	but, they want to buy it,
sd	I really don't .
sv	I don't think anyone does, in fact.
qy	do you have a P C?
sd	I have a I B M P C myself.
sd	I'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty six.
sd	mostly, word processing applications and, just as a dumb terminal.
qw	what do you find that you use yours mostly for?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	I think I'm planning on like moving up, getting a three eighty six before I move up to windows although, you know, I do like the graphical user environment.
sd	I want to be able I just want it more for multi tasking, which I suppose is also like a Macintosh.
sd	that's what I learned a lot of languages on, was an Apple two E in my high school.
b	Uh huh.
qr	Well, do you use your computer for, just things around the house, or in the .
qw	Well, see, what do you do?
sv	and the teacher just tries to teach English, you know, through natural understanding.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and it always seemed strange to me that, you know, all these people that, you know, spoke English not too well, and spoke, you know, a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time.
sv	you don't have hand gestures and things like that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	so, what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I remember my first computer was a T R S eighty with four K on it
sd	or, you know, if they were really great they had sixty four K.
sd	I know, I know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen K on them, is all,
sd	and there was only one computer that had forty eight K on it at the time.
sd	but I know I B M s, you generally, you know, you buy a megabyte at a time.
sd	You know, that's your low , that's the low end.
b	Uh huh.
o	All right.
sv	I guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force.
sv	Few are, basically staying home and being homemakers, and raising kids exclusively.
b	Uh huh.
sd	so she was always, home,
sd	it's like something around sixty, sixty five percent or so now.
sd	I'm not sure what the future holds for that
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's unusual .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	my wife's about six months along.
b	Uh huh.
ba	True.
sv	I would think it would be women that were working full time.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I guess that's good that they've got something to keep them active.
qo	What do you think?
sd	I'm a counselor and a therapist,
sd	and I see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too.
sv	So, kids are raised around their friends and by the media.
sv	And you know, that's contributed,
sv	there are a lot of jobs that are coming about, like in computers at home, and those types of things, that would at least in some ways, bridge the gap .
qw^h	About?
sd	I grew up about the same time you did,
sv	and back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible.
sv	They never learned to be responsible when,
sv	and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad
sv	you know, you create a bigger family, generation after generation but not really on purpose.
sv	and the families, as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but we may have to give up on some things.
b	Yeah.
fc	Okay.
fc	Well, I've enjoyed it, Stephanie.
fc	Uh huh.
sd	and I don't know that that's not a good idea.
aa	I agree.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	Yeah.
aa	no,
sd	and, he was a courier.
sd	and they sentenced him to fifteen years, you know, which they thought that that was a good thing.
sd	and they were told that, he would probably serve three, of the fifteen, and that he had three previous convictions.
sd	However, they could not tell the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal.
sd	so here they based their sentencing thinking that this was this guy's first offense,
sv	but it's just, you know, horrible, since it was first offense
sd	and he'd been convicted three times before, you know,
sd	I mean, he felt that they had been tricked, you know,
qh	I wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change, you know.
b	Yeah.
sv	obviously what we are doing is not working, you know.
aa	No.
sv	and you know, there's people in our prisons that are not being rehabilitated in any way, shape, or form,
sv	and either they're in there, forever or when they get out you know, it's a matter of a few months
sv	and they're going to be right back for the same thing
aa	That's very true.
^q	and, and the, and the people in those countries rely on our money to survive
^q	but I really believe that we need to take care of ourselves,
sv(^q)	so tell them, you've got five years. To work out a plan, to make it on your own.
^q	after two years we'll cut it down to seventy fiv , you know, seventy five percent.
^q	by then you all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help.
sv	And then we'll have, we will have the money if we would do that to, to work on your own system because we've got some serious problems here
sv	and we're trying to, heal the world, you know,
sv	it's just not, it's just not working.
sv	but we've got, you know, kids here in the United States that are dying everyday, too. You know, and being, abused and neglected
sv	I just have this problem with, trying to heal the world when you're so sick yourself, you know,
sv	I think we should try it, like you say,
sv	but I think it would be a good idea to try it.
sv	So, anyway, well, we all agree.
fc	You too, bye bye.
sd	not, it's not really on a regular basis,
sd	Well, see, all the family lives in once place, except for a few of us are scattered about.
sd	So they're pretty much just reunited always
sd	so it's just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together.
aa	I know,
aa	that's true.
qo	How about your family?
sv	you're, a pro at this.
ba	that's good.
qw	And then where do you meet?
bk	Okay.
qy	Do you have relatives in Vernon then?
bk	Okay.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
qy	so this town hall that you meet in, is that like a,
bk	Okay.
qy^d	Potato salad and,
ba	that's good.
b	Right.
b	Right.
ba	that's nice.
b	Right.
qy	Do they always have the one person in the family who everyone thinks they know how to make this the best, so that's what they get to cook.
sd	I haven't, been to a lot,
sd	but we talked, a lot about the rituals,
sv	you all equated the family reunions as, with the Protestant.
sv	It was the Protestant version of the Catholic pilgrimage.
sd	but when the Protestant ethic happened in America, there were people who ever went out and, you know, went away from the family to seek their fortune, and then had to come back home for their reunion, so that, became their version of the pilgrimage.
qy	salads go first and things like that?
b	Right.
ba	Well, that's pretty .
ba	That's wonderful.
sd	I wish we'd,
b	Right.
b	Right.
ba	that's incredible.
b	Right.
b	Right .
qr	have you done this repetitively, or just once?
sd	we had a problem with that.
sd	or the first, you know, major reunion was probably six or seven years ago.
sd	And then the second reunion, people who maybe, you know, had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought, well, it's not that big a thing this year,
sd	and so it kind of wound down,
sd	and then finally, you know, you know, you get the Shreveport relatives there, but no one else
ad	I'll let you go first.
sv	it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty.
sd	in Maryland they do have capital punishment,
sd	and then just nothing happens, just endless, endless, endless appeals.
sv	what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years.
sd	And, here in Maryland I know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons,
sd	here it's, to the point where they were letting prisoners go. commuting the sentences of those that were in jail for lesser crimes, in order to put more people into the jails.
sd	and of course they made a big deal out of the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out, and being rearrested an.
ad	Refresh my memory.
sd	I don't remember myself.
sv	I mean, most people out there committing murders don't care.
sv	They just don't care.
b	Yeah.
sd	and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy.
sd	I think they've got over a hundred dead already this year.
sv	and you have to remember that it, it, there's, I think, X number of people out there that are going to commit murders,
sv	and, once you kill off a few of them ,
sv	I mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that, I mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	and that's about it.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	he was actually on the jury,
sd	Of course he didn't die.
sd	and so they were so upset from robbing this guy, you know, trying to do this holdup that didn't work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started, you know, shooting people.
qh	and get even with who,
sd	And, it turned out that the, you know, policeman survived to the point that he was able to, you know, identify the guy.
sd	And of course, you know, they tried to make the cop look like he was, a, no good rotten drunk.
sd	I mean it was amazing.
sd	he was found guilty,
sd	Now whether they finally got it or not, I don't know.
sd	I kind of, stopped listening after a while.
sd	after he had to go,
sd(^q)	And, yeah everybody was pretty much, you know, let's burn him.
sd	but I mean when it all came down, they just, within an hour decided the man's fate.
b	Yeah.
sd	well, it, it went pretty quick from what he said.
sv	I think, now if you're dealing drugs now, caught more than twice or something, there's, a death penalty associated with it.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I agree.
sd	I mean kidnapping per se has a certain, fine and penalty associated with it,
qw	so what were you saying?
sd	I work with computers.
ny	Yep,
na	I have some friends that have children, not that many actually.
no	too much about child care in New York .
sd	And, I, have just come back and was doing consulting work.
sd	So I am just taking a little bit of time off right now.
sd	And, if I can do that it will,
sd	But, I might start to go crazy with it too.
sd	I miss the intellectual stimulation.
sd	But at the same time it would break my heart to give her to a stranger right now.
aa	yes.
sd	Well, I do not think I would put her in day care for joint , situation right now, unless it was like one other child with a person.
sv	I would not want her to be in a large day care situation so young. Because I think a little infant just does not get the stimulation they need.
sv	But, I just think that, you know, when there's two year olds running around, whoever is taking care of, the care givers are going to pay attention to the two year olds.
sv	And only when the infant screams, are they going to go there,
sv	and if not, the infant is going to lay in the crib all day, and maybe have a mobile above it to play with.
sv	and I think that is so important.
sv	Well, such as things for learning gives the child stimulation I think is important.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	well she's just been doing all kinds of stuff where she's, you know ,
sd	She's two months now, nine weeks.
sd	And she's just drastically moving her eyes from one side to another and things like that.
sd	And she's just started that like yesterday or the day before,
sd	so every days are different.
sd	and I will probably be going back to work around January, whereas she will be about, eight or nine months old.
sd	I have heard it's a rough age to put them into a,
b	Yeah.
sd	We are just going to have, to see how things work out.
sd	but I am trying to, you know, leave her a fair amount, even at this young age, with her grandparents, just to, go to a movie and things like that. So that she is used to other people taking care of her.
sd	but she's met them.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Are they all nearby?
aa	Yeah.
sd	Well, if I work part time that might be doable.
sv	people before they get pregnant are finding child care for the kids .
sd	And so, if I go back to work on a part time basis, I am hoping I can leave my daughter with her. Because, her daughter again will be a couple of months, my daughter will be about six months older than hers.
sv	it will be a little rough when she is a very, very little infant,
sd	and we might even be able to do it on a trade off basis. That I watch, their baby when they want to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever, or if she wants an afternoon off. Even if she wants an afternoon just to work. and not be bothered,
sd	we might be able to exchange that way.
sv	But you know, ideally I think, business should have the, day care centers there, whether it's the parents who take turns watching the kids, or whether
sv	and, you know, parents come down to supervise or, whatever.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sd	and it's probably my fault, because I do not have a real schedule now.
sd	well she's been staying up late at night and, you know, sleeping late in the mornings and things is just fine by me .
b	Right.
sv	so that, a judge, I think, would be the most appropriate person to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day.
aa	Right .
b	Uh huh.
sd	It's almost like the NIGHT COURT we see on T V.
sv	that was one thing I thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way.
ny^r	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
sd	and I didn't mean that .
sv	Sort of like car accidents, you know,
b	Yeah.
aa^r	right .
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
no^t	Well, I, i , we're at liberty to talk and meander as long as it's all on the same theme.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	bu , well you can tell I haven't been in too many judges chambers or anything like that .
no	well I was called once when I was nineteen
sd	they let me out.
sd	and that was almost twenty years ago .
ba	How interesting.
b^r	Uh huh .
o	Okay.
ad	Go ahead.
ny	Yeah.
qw^d	well, if you had all the money in the world or something.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
b	Yeah.
qw	What do you have now?
b	Uh huh.
sd	my car is the first one we ever bought new, too.
sd	But we just bought another used car, a couple weeks ago, actually.
sd	mine is a Honda Accord.
sd	some of the cars that I got were like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors
sd	and mine is a standard
sd	and the reason I got a standard was because I thought it handled a lot better
sd	it had a lot more pickup and everything.
b	Uh huh.
sd	usually AVIS.
na^m	AVIS.
ny	Yeah.
sd	but we have corporate contracts you know, with the various companies
sd	so it depends on your destination, too.
sd	Kind of strange .
no	Work for T I. Uh huh, which is how I heard about this .
b	Uh huh.
b	really.
bh	It did,
ba	my gosh.
ba	that was great.
sv	and it's excluded.
sv	you got your money's worth.
ba	that is good.
sd	Mine hasn't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it
sd	but I was real lucky because it just hit the, the lens to the light.
sd	So it cost me twenty five bucks to replace that,
sd	so. No big deal.
ng	I probably wouldn't, just because I already have one
sd	but, you know, if I had to make the choice again, yeah, I, I'm perfectly happy with what I decided although we did just buy another car,
sd	and that's a Legend
sd	but it's a used one
sd	it was a real old one
sd	and it served me real well, too.
sd	So he's been impressed with all the Honda cars.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qw	How did it go for you?
qy^d	Hasn't left you stranded.
b	Yeah.
b	Really.
^2	it's windy.
sd	the Legend, it's just so huge.
qy	right?
qy	have you done much camping?
b	Uh huh.
ba	well, that sounds good.
qw	Where do you find places to camp?
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well that sounds adventuresome .
sd	but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains.
sd	and they do a lot of camping with the scouts
sd	and so that's been real enjoyable for them.
sd	and this year I believe they will be in tents also.
ny	yeah.
bh	is that right?
qw	and what does that consist of?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	so I like to sleep on the matresses.
qy	so, have you had any encounters with wild animals or anything like that?
ba	Gee.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Oh.
b	Oh.
na	they're covered like with a heavy armor type stuff,
ny	uh huh.
ba	My word.
b	Uh huh .
qr^d	But they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything.
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you have a personal computer?
qy	You do, in your home?
qy	Do you find you use it a lot?
qw	What kind do you have?
ba	Well, that sounds interesting.
sd	I have a P S one I B M type.
sd	and I put all my personal stuff on it at work .
sd	but probably if I didn't have access to one all the time at work, I'd want one at home.
qy	What is that tracking the flights and things?
sd^t	They tell us when we're through.
bh	really?
sd^t	and it's time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that.
sd^t	It's not more than five min , ,
sd	so I'm just going to ignore it.
sv	It's kind of a hassle when you have this,
sd	I work at Texas Instruments.
ny	Yes.
sd^e	I sure do.
sd	I'm already home for the day.
sd	so I'm pretty busy.
sd	We use Word Perfect, Lotus.
sd	I think that's about my favorite.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I know there's still a hundred things I don't know how to do on it.
sd	But, you know, you learn something every time you use it.
b	Uh huh.
qy^t	did they give you a number to call?
sd^t	but you can only make one call a day.
sd^t	if you've talked to someone, like you're talking to me now and I place the call, this counts as your call.
sd^t	So you cannot make a call now until tomorrow.
sd^e	we both do.
qy^t	Didn't they ask you for your I D number when you answered?
sd^t	so you both do.
aa	From what I understand.
sd	It's for research.
sd	It's a research type project on voice activated electronics, you know.
sd	Now I don't know, I don't know everything about it
sd	and that way they can check voice patterns.
sd	and get the computer where it recognizes voices.
aa	Well, I probably do because I've,
aa	so I probably do.
sd	It's right outside of Dallas.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, Richardson's right between Dallas and Plano.
aa	You probably did.
qw	Well, what are you doing way in Washington?
ba	Well, that's interesting.
qy^d	So I imagine they use personal computers.
qy	Do they do their correspondence on it?
b	Uh huh.
sv	I honestly don't feel like it's strict enough in my opinion.
sd	Applied at all.
sv	Well, I just feel like there's a lot of murderers and rapists, and everything else, just walking the streets. You know?
sv	Not getting paroled, lets say in so many, years.
sv	I mean, if your going to sentence somebody, lets say twenty years, let them stay twenty years.
aa	that's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv@	They have really got it better than we do, in a lot of ways . You know? / * two utts? you know as sep?
sv	it seems like, really a rough time
sv	You know, when they go to prison, it, they really seem like it's a rough time for them
sv	he's just there to serve his time, and get back out on the street.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I would love to see them just really get real strict on parole you know.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	I know.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	a lot of people really doesn't think that much about it, because it hasn't happened to them, which it hasn't to me either, you know?
sd	But still, it could.
b	Uh huh.
sd	You know, I, haven't kept up, you know, anything, like that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	But still, it came up though, didn't it,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	The victim is really, seems like left out in the cold, more or less, doesn't it,
sd(^q)	and you read, you know, you think, oh my goodness
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Or, you know, plead insanity.
o@	You know . * slash error And a lots of things. / * slash error
b	yes,
b^r	Uh huh.
sv	it just, just doesn't make sense,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, like I, said, I live in a small place. You know.
sd	but now I'm raising children.
b	Uh huh.
sv^t	Well, we're probably fixing to run out of time pretty, soon,
fc	but I've enjoyed talking to you.
fc	Bye
ad	Ladies, first.
qy	so your a homemaker?
sv	I guess, that's, the right term nowadays.
sd	and she stays home, too, also.
sv	for example, like the COSBY SHOW to me is just kind of like a waste of my time, and DIFFERENT STROKES.
sd	But I like SIXTY MINUTES, PRIME TIME LIVE.
sd	I like the old timey ones, TOM AND JERRY.
o	There you go.
sd	JOHNNIE QUEST. the good ones.
sd	now if I'm ever home during the day on a vacation day, I have to catch at twelve o'clock the ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, because I usually, because he's one of my idles.
sv	it seems like nowadays everything is so electronic, you know, magnified and animated, that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings.
sd	I just don't watch it. Because of the timing,
sv	but, some of the crap that's on T V nowadays, it's about .
sd	I do watch the special shows that they come out with, the NOVA stuff. and, the nature shows.
sd	we don't have cable to the point of the H B O or any of that stuff.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
ba	me.
ba	no.
bf	Fifteen years.
bf	Bet they hated that.
ba	goodness.
sd	I can remember staying home, when I was five and six, and my mother watching the EDGE OF NIGHT.
sd	Well, I think they were back to back, and black and white.
sd(^q)	and I was like, my gosh.
^2	Still be on.
sv	Now they got a lot of other crap involved.
sv	I think some of the tones of the daily prime time is questionable,
aa	I have to agree with you.
sv	You know keep them on the channel twenty one. The nature stuff, you know .
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
sv	and I do appreciate speaking with you.
qy	Have you gotten your catalog yet?
sd	and it inspired me to make more phone calls .
bh	really.
ad*	Give them your pen number. / * sp: pin
fc	Have a good day.
qw	Tell me, what are some of the things that you did with your children when they were growing up?
b	Uh huh.
sd	and so as they were growing up much of, our, normal life outside of school and everything revolved around their swimming.
sd	so we were always together at their meets.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	they even made nationals.
sd	and we tried to do things both together and individually with the children,
sd	so we would always go in for the museums.
sd	so, one of the things that we did with him a lot was to go, either my husband or I, or both of us would, t , concerts with him.
sd	so our whole family, we take family trips to different places to visit or go to fish shows,
sd	I don't think we've missed a fish store on the entire northeast coast of the United States .
sd	but as they got older we tried to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things, and that there would be a feature each day. Whether it would be going to,
sd	and we went to the marble quarries up there, to see that, and another day fish hatchery,
sd	and, so } you know, we did try,
sd	and of course we learned too.
sd	when they were very young I did not work.
sd	but that leaves me off on holidays and summers.
sd	I think they need me more, when they were older, than they did when they were,
aa	yeah.
qy	do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see?
b	Uh huh.
sd	but there were always things that just tumbled out.
sv	when it's not there they miss it.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but occasionally they do,
sv	and when they do, there's a reason for it, that they're sharing it,
sd	and at least I've wanted to be available, when for some reason, they had, they were bouncing something off of me. Because it was something that was bothering them or they were concerned about,
sv(^q)	you just felt, gee, if I weren't here, how,
aa	That's right.
sv	You don't have grandparents near by or aunts and uncles.
sd	I mean, I grew up in a situation where on weekends we were always visiting relatives.
b^r	yeah.
sd	every weekend there was some visiting somewhere.
sd	it's not that constant thing where you are on intimate terms with cousins.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	where parents are spending less time, you don't have the families, to take up the gap.
sv	And so the kids in some ways are, are suffering a little bit, in that, the role models that get the, the family issues that get discussed, and all these, I think are very important parts of them growing up,
sd	We keep in close contact with grandparents and talk over the phone,
qh	because then how do they pattern their own?
b	Yeah,
sd	Well, we have had this tradition, that we always go out before Christmas and cut our own tree.
sd	Now, this year, it's, was hard with our son now being in college.
sd	but we did that from the time the children were young enough to realize what it was until, our older son went away to college.
sd	And we have advent calendars still, from the time that they came, you know, to,
b	Oh.
b	yes.
sd	a friend a friend of mine from Denmark hand appliqu3ed one for each child.
sd	and you buy a present,
sd	and I mean, the presents have gone from the days when they were very young to a little box of Band Aids and an eraser and things,
sd	today, where, sometimes I put a little gift occasionally a Christmas tree decoration which they will save for their future, to sometimes, just money, pieces of candy.
sd	for my older boy that was in college I put a dollar bill for each day. Which was the equivalent
nd	well, it was the equivalent of a Christmas present.
sd	and those will be passed on to them when they, when they get married and leave.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	yes,
sd	We, as I said, living in an area of Washington, D C. We definitely see this,
sd	and, it's that grandmother figure, not only raising her own children, but raising, children from the streets, too, frequently.
sv	it's a rite of passage .
qy	Are you in the middle of anything?
qy	The whole thing?
qy	Did the framing and all?
sd	and I did all the sheetrocking and the interior work .
b	Ye ,
b	Yeah.
sd	My wife wishes I hadn't done that.
sv	I think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy.
qr	or was it stuff that was already, enclosed?
b^m	Brand new .
qy	and you knew how to do the framing?
b	Uh huh.
qr	do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground?
qy	On the piers?
qr^d	or you did them yourself?
qy	You just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete?
sd	Well, the last thing I did completely myself was an outside deck which I was pretty proud of .
sd	I designed it from scratch and did it did a pretty good job.
sd	You can always tear stuff out and redo it.
sd	I I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and, a backrest and all that stuff.
sd	And, and then the rest of it I just did.
sd	The same size as the addition that I just put on
aa	Yeah.
sd	I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and, you know, no less than that.
sd	cost me about six hundred dollars all together.
b	Yeah.
sv	I'd be surprised if it wasn't, cheaper where you are.
sv	It probably comes from where you are.
sd	When I drive through that area, that's all I see is pressure treated lumber yards.
sd	East Texas.
sd	my current project is a walkway which I'm building around the house and out to the backyard you know, digging it out and laying sand and putting, pavers on top of that
sv	That's a lot easier.
qo	Well, let me just start by asking what you think of this Middle East affair we've got going on?
sv	Just let these people fight it out
qh	and what does it cost these people over there, you know.
qo	The break ups?
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	that's right.
sv	and we wouldn't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that we're spending.
b	Right.
sv	We've been writing off way too many bad debts country bad debts. Exactly.
aa	I know it.
b	Right.
sv	you're either liberal or you're conservative,
sv	there's just too many issues that come up that, our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because it's a Democratic issue or it's a Republican issue
sv	and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel, I think, we might have a lot better, a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed.
bh^m	He's one of the two,
qy^g	Senators are in for six years, right
qw	and, when did you guys vote him into office?
sv	you're stuck.
qy	so do you do a lot of cooking in your family?
b	yeah.
qy	do you like to cook.
b^r	yeah.
b	really.
b	Oh.
sv	but that's neat though, because you get to have different stuff .
sd	he put himself through college working in restaurants.
sd	they're really happy, that I don't cook anymore.
qy^d	You obviously have one.
bf	you have two.
b^m	Two and half,
qrr	Or are you not at that stage yet?
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	yeah.
ba	my gosh.
sd	I couldn't .
sd	Boy, I couldn't do that,
b	really.
qy	what is that, Saint Jack or something.
sd	Scallops Saint something,
b^r	yeah.
^2	with scallops.
sv	And, that sounds delicious to me.
ba	That sounds great.
sd	they had, a murder mystery,
sd	and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner,
sd	so, so I was thinking there's this Beef Bourguignonne recipe that I've tried before that's pretty good
sd	and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sd	and they, always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table .
aa^r	yeah.
ba	my gosh.
b^r	yeah.
ba	gosh,
sv	that's just part of it.
sd	but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly,
sd	There was dishes that he really enjoyed, eating.
sd	so he had to put up with it .
sd	I had to make vegetarian meals without using soy beans,
aa	That's true .
sv	Because you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete,
ad	So, well, I guess I'll let you get back to feeding your little one there.
qy^d	He's set,
qrr	or do you get into that,
b	Yeah .
b	no kidding.
sd	and my mother taught me how to make it.
sv	If you make homemade bread,
sv	It tastes so good.
ny	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	but I've never done it.
ba	That sounds pretty good.
b^r	yeah.
sd	but you pinch off a portion, or save a portion of it for the next time, or something.
qh	I don't know how safe that was .
sv	that's got to kill anything I guess,
fc	Plano.
fc	Plano, in Texas.
fc	Are you in Texas?
fc	gosh it sounds so close.
fc	I thought for sure you were in Dallas or something.
fc^r	yeah.
fc	that's where we went.
fc^r	yeah.
fc	you did,
fc	It's nice over there.
fc	really.
fc	so we decided we'll try in a couple of years,
fc	you probably could,
fc	well it's good talking to you.
fc	Take care.
b	Yeah.
b	All right .
sd	I'm, kind of a sailor.
sd	I was kind of into it for a while there.
ny^r	Yeah
sd	I had a little sail,
b	No .
qw	What part of Texas you from?
qw	whereabouts is that?
bk	all right.
bh	Is that right?
ba	that's pretty wild.
bf	so you got some lakes around you can do that on.
qy^d	You do skiing and stuff
bh	Yeah?
bh	Yeah?
b	All right.
sd	the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now.
b	Yeah.
sd	but, no, I have, I had a boat last summer that I took out, a catamaran that I did a lot of sailing on and stuff.
sd	they're kind of into it.
qy^g	I guess fishing's a pretty big thing,
b	Yeah.
qy	Is that centrally located
qw	what major city is nearby?
qr	and that's south or north of there or something?
bk	Okay.
qy	does that stay pretty constant there
bh	Yeah?
qy	have you done, any other boating then
bh	Yeah?
ba	that's great.
sd	I'd go to work,
sd	like those catamarans are pretty fast.
sd	my family's pretty into it
sd	and, I took sailing lessons when I was about six
sd^e	it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while, you know, just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and the physics behind it.
sv	but some people are more motorboaters, you know which is fine.
sv	but, then, again, m , they may never have tried anything like, catamaran
sd	they get so fast, you know.
sd	they get pretty quick,
sd	I work with a guy right now that, races catamarans in the summertime
sd	He's got a good,
nd	Well, he's from Detroit
sd	so that's a good thing.
qw	yeah, so, what do you do for a job?
bh	really?
qy	is that for T I
qy	Are they primarily electronic, then?
bk	Okay.
b	Right.
qo	how do you like it down there in Texas?
bh	Yeah?
ba	no doubt.
sd	I've been to Oklahoma,
qy^d	I'm guessing you probably do.
bk	I see.
b	Right.
qw	And what kinds of things do you use it for when you go houses to them?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	sure.
b	Yeah.
sv	well, I tell you once you get used to having them you get spoiled really quickly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	and, when I was first here in Dallas or in Plano, this is, been like fourteen years ago we moved here. And I was finally able to afford a new typewriter, and I got an I B M Selectric. I thought I had died and gone to heaven because , I thought, they're so wonderful.
sd	and, boy once that happened, there was just no way that I could ever go back to doing anything of length of the typewriter.
b	Uh huh.
qy	do you use WordPerfect ever? Have you ever used WordPerfect?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	That's probably where you've used it.
sd	It may be improved by now
sv	some of the commands just had nothing to do with, you know, what they, what they did on the computer
sv	I mean like going, forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just, you know, didn't match with the kinds of keys, you were using.
sv	and it does a lot of things too that if you do any kind of, research or anything like that where you have to, use footnotes, it is just wonderful. Because it keeps track of all your footnotes.
sd	and if you put a footnote in the middle, you know, if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it, it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you.
sv	But I think, it's a nice kind of way to be spoiled .
qy^d	so, unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with P C s.
sd	and he was an engineer. so I did tech writing for a number of years.
aa	sure.
qy^g	Got a problem,
qy^g	Trying to figure out what all that was about, .
sd	but, now all of the sc , scholastic majors though,
sd	so I'm real spoiled.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's great.
b^m	Yeah.
sv	and, you know, the, and it seems like it's getting earlier and earlier with the children.
sv	So, I think that that would be a real, advantage to her to have that and, do it early,
ba	neat.
ba	great.
b	Right .
fc	This is really going to be fun I think,
sd	this is really ironic that I would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away .
sd	And it's just been tearing me up all day .
sd	So this is just really strange .
sd	but he's always stayed right here you know,
sd	And so this is just really strange, you know because,
sd	I always forget .
sd	Australian shepherd.
sv	I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big.
h	You know, but, I don't know .
sd	I do, too .
sd	about two years.
fe	gosh, anyway,
qh	isn't that funny how we do?
b	Yeah .
sv	Well, they're companions,
qy	Well, do you have any?
qw	How do they get along together?
sv	and they're friends, you know.
sv	and they love you right back
aa	No.
aa	I know.
sd	this is just so hard.
sd	He's never been gone for, at all
sd	you know, he's just always been right there when he gets out.
sd	You know, it's the first time he's ever been gone like this .
h	So I don't know.
sd(^q)	they told us like at the Humane Society and the adoption center, you know, don't give up hope, you know,
sd	We've got so many when he was a puppy ,
sd	We have him on film, you know, on the video camera .
sd	You know, but you can't put that on the ,
h	you know, so , So, I don't know,
sd	we will put Some posters and stuff up .
sd	so that helps, too, you know, if they can keep,
b^m	yeah,
sd	I think that, if he gets out he'll come back.
x	,
sd	and I would get this kind of a call .
sd	it's very strange
sv	they're so small
sv	and, you know, they can get hurt a lot easier.
sv	You know, they can get hurt a lot easier, you know,
sv	so that would make you really, tend to worry about them , you know, if they're not right there
bh	Is that right?
sd	I guess I really don't know cats that well because my mother never liked them,
sd	so I never had them growing up,
sd	so I've never owned one , you know, since I,
sv	and they'll put their head underneath your hand, you know.
sv	and, most dogs do that.
sv	I mean, you know, they know exactly how to get that attention, you know,
sv	and they put your, you know
sv	or they'll rub their head against you, you know .
sd	and then we get home at night we do bring him in.
ny	Uh huh,
sd	That's why we couldn't understand why he would want to get out , you know, because he's had all this room to run in,
sd	He dug a hole under the fence.
sd	and, you know, we filled it back up put him back in there.
sd	He did it again
sd	so we chained him up
sd	you know, but we really didn't want to keep him chained up because, you know, we feel like that's just too restricting for him.
sd	So, we, we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it, you know, so that he couldn't get out.
sd	Well, he kind of ripped through the chicken wire .
sd	I mean, we have two kids, you know, that just love him a lot,
sd	we just couldn't,
sv	I don't think it's anything we did .
sd	Least I hope not .
sd	I think that's what really bothers me the most about it .
sd	Well, I don't know if it's quite hit them.
sd	I have two girls,
sd(^q)	but now it's like, well if he doesn't come home, can we get another dog .
^q	and you already want to replace him .
sd	Buddy.
ny	Uh huh.
bh	Is that right ?
bk	Oh .
ba	That's funny.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
sd	I didn't know that.
sd	I had no idea.
sd	I did not know that.
b^m	Okay.
nd	I haven't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months,
sd	but I rent probably four or five movies a week.
qy^d	AIR AMERICA
qy	Have you seen WILD ORCHID?
qy	do you like, steamy movies .
qo	what type of movies do you like?
bk	Okay.
qrr	or do you like, just action
sd@	JAGGED EDGE was a suspenseful one. Or, FATAL ATTRACTION.
sd	well I hope I don't run across them.
qw	What was your favorite all time movie?
sd	I have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most, that I was really the most in shock with was probably, STAR WARS.
sd	When that first came out, I really did not expect the special effects or anything like that.
sd	I was ready to go back and see it again, you know
sd	Now, I also liked, GONE WITH THE WIND or some of the classic, like THE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA
bh	you haven't?
ny	yeah.
sd	and it's got a good historical perspective to it.
b	yeah.
sd	And it's about Al Capone's brothers. Primarily one of his brothers,
sd	Al Capone had three brothers,
sd	and, he turns out to be a law man.
sd^e	it's really interesting
sd	I just gave away just enough to get you interested .
sd^e	it is.
sd	And, a lot of times, what I wind up doing is, picking say an actor or an actress, and seeing like all,
sd	I've seen all of James Dean's movies. all of Mae West's movies.
sv	I guess you could do that, you know, get all of David Carradine's movies, or, Segal,
sd	I can't remember his first name.
sd	he was on, Arsenio, just recently.
sd	It was really kind of interesting because, Arsenio was asking him about, what he thought of, one of the other action guys.
sd	But I like all the RAMBO movies.
b	Yeah.
^q	Yo, Adrian .
sd	we actually rent, probably a good combination of movies with the exception of horror films.
sd	Don't watch really very many horror films at all.
sd	there's something about people coming up through the sofa to get you, or something, you know, coming out of the T V that just doesn't make my day, you know.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I just saw, a really interesting movie called, FLATLINERS.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	You know, I mean, and it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	that was a great movie.
b	Yeah.
qy	have you seen SHRIMP ON THE BARBY ?
b	ye , yeah,
nn	No.
nn	No.
qy	Hogan?
nn	No,
sd^e	it's got, Cheech Marin .
sd	it's kind of a poor man's PRETTY WOMAN in reverse.
qy	Actually did you see DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS?
sd	I enjoyed that.
sd^e	I haven't.
sd	I hear that's the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of home video .
b	Yeah.
sd	It's from DANCES WITH WOLVES.
sd	he happens to be, a friend of one of her business associates. or, not a friend, a cousin.
sd	so we've got to, try to get out there and see that one.
qy	Now did you see, DRIVING MISS DAISY?
bk	Okay.
qw	so what kind of cars are you looking at?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	In fact my dad recently got a Pontiac, believe six thousand
sd	and he got a demo.
sd	And it's been a real good car
sd	and it's like new
sd	and it only had very low mileage on it.
sv	Of course, they're fully loaded usually.
sv	So I think it's a pretty good option.
qy	are they new .
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	And then the Cadillac is definitely a used car
b	Uh huh.
ba	Oh no .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	That's what I'm thinking about on my next car is do I want to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new
qh	or do I look for a used car that's maybe three years old that but that's, you know, low mileage and in good shape.
qh	or , or is something wrong with it
sv	but I guess that's a risk you have to take.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qy	do you know?
ba	that's not bad.
sv	It'd be well worth it if you're considering buying a car . to find out.
sd	Well, it's kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because I just got mine paid off about a month ago,
sd	I just want to enjoy not having any car payments for a while and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and, you know, hang on to the one I've got for a few years because it's, it's almost four years old,
sd	I have a Mazda R X seven.
aa	Uh huh.
sd	I just about could really because I think my car,
sv	if I continue taking good care of it, it's going to hold a pretty good resale value
sv	and, if I consider going the used car route and save up some money, I shouldn't have too much trouble at all.
ad	Could you hold on for just a moment?
sd^c	I didn't want to interfere with whatever they're trying to record.
sd	and I do want to hold onto it and you know, enjoy it while it's not having any mechanical problems whatsoever,
sd	in fact it never has
sd	and I want to hang on to it while it's still being a good car and while I'm not tired of it and while I'm single and can handle a two seater for now and get that out of my system.
sv	Because one of these days I'll be getting a six seater probably too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my gosh .
ba	no.
b	Yeah.
qw	What kind of car is it?
qy	Are you going to trade it in on this new one
b	Uh huh.
sd	So she's going to sell it rather than trade it in.
sv	That's probably the best thing.
sv	Or maybe more than that, as I've learned.
sd	Well I turned around and sold it myself for forty two hundred.
sv	but they just, are going to give you that much less for your trade in.
sd	What I think.
sd	But strangely enough, I mean, the best bargaining I had made with a dealer on my car was also the same place I got the best price trade in,
sd	plus I was going through that T I fleet discount program.
nd	Well, it's before they had that.
sd	and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the fleet program,
sd	and what you could expect, they said, you know, a five percent over cost and then options at cost and everything.
sd	So, I figured out a price based on that.
sd	But I guess I got a pretty good deal, because I went back to the Town North Mazda right off Central and offered them the same price as what I knew I was going to be able to get it for in Arlington
sd(^q)	and they said there is no way you can get this car for that price, especially if we add on the equalizer and the cruise control.
sd	they took the car, I knew they were going to pull it from Town North because that's where the white one was.
sd	So it was that same car.
^q	well, unless you're selling car with hail damage and flood damage , I got the car off your lot for that price .
sd	And I laughed real hard when I took it in for the two thousand mile checkup
sd	and he recognized me.
sv	and I'm sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day
sd	of course, when the place in Arlington went and took the car because I told him there's a place in Arlington that's going to give it to me for that price.
sd(^q)	He said, No they're not.
sv	So I'm sure he knew .
sd	and I just had the biggest grin on my face.
sd	It was kind of nice.
fc	Good talking to you too, Don.
fc	good luck in your car hunting.
fc	Bye bye.
sv	I guess my initial view is our tax burden hasn't gone down in recent years despite tax cuts
sv	I take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the economy, that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes, energy taxes, particularly, and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes, that's the direction we should look.
aa^m	Where's it all going?
sd	Well, one, one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax which in principle is going into a big trust fund,
sv	and Senator Moynihan's, proposal to, to cut there I think makes a lot of sense.
sv	I think Senator Moynihan's proposal to cut the social security tax which isn't really going to beef up, up the social security program could make a lot of sense.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I think Japan is probably about equal to ours
sd	Our friends were amazed that the cost of things when they went to Canada not so long ago.
sv	And, as a whole, most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services,
sv	they're real trade offs there.
sd^e	I'm at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. part of the Commerce Department. Here in Gaithersburg, Maryland.
sd	I, I didn't pick it,
sd	but I certainly have the feeling I've been given topics different from the ones that I mentioned before.
sd^e	when you place a call topic is given to you.
ad	you should try it.
sv	one thing that has kept our tax burden high, and this will change somewhat in the next few years is the level of the defense budget
sv	But, I believe Israel does that, don't they for their,
sv	Wel , everybody has to do something.
sd	Or maybe theirs is, in fact, one year of military service for everyone.
b	Okay.
sv	and then, country would benefit from one year from everybody and even out the, requirement.
ba	Well, now that's a thought.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	right.
sv	it quickly would be significant industry in figuring out how to get around it where people,
b	Yeah.
sv	it's just that they, are more self centered if you will and not considering, a voluntary ,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and I think we need to try to figure out some way to turn that around that everybody,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
am	Well, that could be.
aa	right.
sd	and, I guess, looking back on it, I tend to think it was mostly a mistake.
sd	On the other hand, the more I learn about the history, the more I see it was incremental, decisions. Any one of which was sort of understandable at the time.
qo	How about you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	I guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense.
sv	and, with their nations pretty solidly behind each one of them.
sv	Otherwise they'd get you someplace else.
sd	and as you say, going halfway was probably worse than, committing to a completely and, winning it, whatever that would mean.
b	Yeah .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	yeah.
sd	that pendulum started to swing, maybe even too far. To the point where, supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the Vietnam war on.
sd	this Desert Storm stuff may have, killed it.
sv	Well, what I believe is one of the major things that is wrong with our public school system is that, we do not have enough discipline
sv	and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now.
sd	when I went to school, I know I was scared to death about being disciplined,
sd	and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different.
sd	You know, you did not see, I did not see anybody in my classrooms, when I was going to school, act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom.
aa^r	that's right.
sd	my daughter's in the, fourth grade
sd	and, there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom, where the teacher cannot teach
sd	and when I went to school that just wasn't put up with.
sv	Well, they just don't do that any more.
sv	But the school system's afraid of getting sued and, all sorts of lawsuits I'm sure because of things like that.
sv	and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school.
sv	And, I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.
sv	and you know, we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not.
sv	I think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire.
sd	I have heard stories, from other parents that I know of, their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs,
sd	I've heard some horrible stories about high school teachers
sd	and, you know, to be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school.
sv	with what they have to work with, I think they're doing a pretty good job right now.
b	Uh huh,
qy@	You don't have any children in school? Don't have any kids.
qy^d	so this is probably a real hard subject for you.
fc	It was a joy in talking with you.
fc	thanks.
ad	why don't you go ahead first and tell what kind of car you'd look for in your next.
qy^d	And, of course, it has to have air conditioning .
qy	Does it have to be a special color? .
qy^g	It sounds like something your husband would drive, right? .
sd	but that made it better economically,
sd	It wouldn't be a used car,
qrr	or doesn't really matter.
sv	it's hard for people to get in with a two door sometimes.
qy^g	It would be fun just to win one, wouldn't it ?
fc	well, I think that's all that we need to say.
fc	we'll talk to you later.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	so, I was able to get that back pretty easily.
qy	Have you?
b	Right .
b	Yeah.
aa	Right
aa	Exactly.
sd	They were talking about cars, the car issue just came out. And about how, yeah, you'd like to buy an American car maybe
sd	but, you know, the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever.
qh	You know, so it's like, what are you going to do, you know?
sv	and, you know, they should start making quality products.
sd	That's what I thought, too, until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue.
sv	and they're pieces of junk.
sd	that's eighty six through ninety one.
sv	maybe they're starting to get a clue.
sv	Technology that comes in right now is probably not going to be implemented until, you know, quite a few years down the road.
sv	because technology is so, you know, volatile and changing all the time.
b	Yeah.
sv	and that's a real good thing, I guess.
h	I don't know.
sv(^q)	and you're like, gee, they're reselling a MacIntosh under a different name.
b	Yeah, you know.
sv	and I really don't see an advantage of Windows at all.
sd	but, I really don't do much with it at home
qy^d	you sound like you must, work in the computer business.
bh	Yeah?
bh	No?
ba	Well, that's all right.
sd	let's take the example, the modem for, you know,
sv	I imagine in Argentina you've got some great foods.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
sd	I've had that meal in New York, where they bring you a plank, sort of, with all this wonderful beef parts of beef, cooked and barbecued
sd	I have to find a place around here that has that.
qy	You serve that yourself, or for a family?
qy	You ever serve that yourself when you have company?
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
qy^d	you don't go buy it from a wholesaler.
sd	so I know.
b	Yeah.
qw	what other, what dishes do you serve with it?
^2	the stuffed turnover.
sd	I love those,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you remember when you were in Washington, Sam the Argentine baker?
sd	I guess, in the early seventies.
sd	so that's before your time.
sv	Your parents might remember if they were here then.
sd	We used to get the most marvelous impenadas and other Argentine things.
sd	I'm Italian.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	Because there're many Italians in Argentina.
sd	my grandfather came to the United States through Argentina.
sd	This was around the turn of the century. actually a little bit later, like nineteen twelve, nineteen thirteen.
sd	My husband is Chinese.
sd	and we both love Continental cooking, French cooking.
sd	we don't usually mix.
sd	well, if we're entertaining we'll do a Chinese recipe
sd	you can steam many of the things in a microwave.
qy^d	I don't know if you have one.
sd	And if you like Chinese food, you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it and chop some scallions and a little ginger and just cover it with some, waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done,
sd	and it's a wonderful flavorful piece of fish.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ad	buy a fresh filet of fish, a nice one at the fish counter.
sd	Sole is good, flounder
sd	sole or flounder is real good. And even grouper.
sd	Little bit of soy sauce and sesame seed oil.
sd	some chopped up you know, slivers of scallions. And slivers of ginger. And then just cover it and put it in the microwave for just say two minutes, check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes.
ad	Don't overcook it though.
ad	Well, you see, just check it, you know, during,
qy	it's that sweet Chinese sauce?
sd	Well if you go in a Chinese store ask for hoi sin, H O I S I N.
sd	H O I ,
sd	S I N, or S E N
sd	And if you take, little pieces of pork and you fry them, like little cubes of pork. And you fry them with garlic and a couple dashes of hot pepper and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry, just a little sherry to thin it, and stir that in. You can even put a spoon of ketchup in,
sd	and that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce, that you can serve over rice.
sd	but if you're serving another dish with it, say the rice dish well, with guys pretty healthy appetites, I'd probably go a third of a pound
sd	And you can always heat it up again, and save, you know.
sd	You can also do the same thing if you have ground beef.
sd	Use the same hoi sin sauce and some of the frozen mixed vegetables.
sd	and you've got a very colorful side, another dish.
qy	the hoi sin sauce?
sd	a dollar twenty nine a can.
sd	A can would serve you for, you know, for quite a few, meals, you know.
sd	It's one of the Chinese cooking basics.
fc	well listen, it was good talking with you.
fc	Hope you enjoy your recipe.
fc	Bye bye.
sv	and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like I do.
sd	Well, public school all the way up kindergarten all the way up to, high school.
sd	I am.
sd	and they can't do that.
sd	I mean our high school up here is like a junior college in Florida
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Like they have that down there that,
sv	there's no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some general business courses in high school.
sd	and we had a vocational, electronics in our high school.
sd	So when I went to my first year of tech school, I had a very easy time because our high school had a good program.
sv	I find that that the, that in the cities, it's more like the kids go there socialize not really to learn
sv	but if don't work with them as a parent, I think you're putting your child at a big disadvantage.
sv	So, it's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from.
qy	are they going to move to, Mexico?
b	Uh huh.
sv	if the industry comes hopefully they'll promote good schools.
sv	plus for the type of student that's going to that school, it's going to raise the level of the school because your parents are engineers or chemists.
sv	They're going to help you.
h	So, I don't know.
sv	Actually, I think it should be the city level and a system level really to find out, and to see what they need and not overinflate it,
sv	like, if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back, and you're getting raises every eighteen months you got to go now, hey, wait a minute,
sd(^q)	People are going, whoa.
sd	and the only school you could go to was the Baptist school or the Catholic school
b	Yeah
sd	See, this isn't a subject that I think a lot about because I'm never faced with it because our school system in Vermont, it seems to do a really good job.
bh	Is it?
b	Well,
qw	So what movies have you seen lately?
bk	Oh.
sd	that's on my list to see.
b	okay.
bh	did you?
sd	See that's also on my list.
qo	how do you mean?
b	Right.
bh	A switcheroo,
sv	When the shoe is on the other foot and see how it,
sd	and, you know, the girlfriends just taking off for a day or something. Just getting in trouble and probably not that much trouble
b	yeah.
sd	Before we found the shopping malls that's what we did.
sd	well, I'll have to keep that on my list then.
b	Oh.
b^m	Scandalous?
ba	I can imagine.
sv	I guess she does it for the social value of showing you what trash is,
sv	You had to wade through it and find it .
sv	You never quite got to,
sv	All I know about that woman is that she's an incredible marketeer .
aa^m	and she's rich
qy^g	She knows how to twist this around,
sd	I just adored it.
sd	and, so, } you know, just the general theme of the whole movie was, pretty,
sd	I mean I really liked it a lot.
sv	and I only bring up WOUNDED KNEE because that was what ten years ago you read and understood, you know, about the Indian population,
sv	and then everything went away for a couple years,
sv	And, you know, it's sort of a popular view of, what happened way back then.
h	Really I don't kn ,
sd	and the other one was, vegetarian kind of, you know, feel good tribe. You know, sort of thing,
sv	so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world.
sv	Nobody can get along peacefully .
b	I see.
b	Yeah.
sd	I have come to respect a little bit more you know, what went on here,
qh	but who knows how it's supposed to all end .
sv	I think about, you know, just the meaning of, the freedom of this country and what that really meant.
sv	And that was taking over somebody else's freedoms. And sort of trampling that
sv	I got a little sick of his mug on the screen every, three minutes,
sv	I just thought it was a really interesting, intense film.
sv	Intense I think is the word for it because three hours went by really fast.
sd	Ate a lot of popcorn.
bh	Did it really?
bf	It made you think.
sv	but there are no answers, you know.
sv	that can make you crabby, yes.
sv	they sort of candy coated the western story for many years,
sv	it always balances out one way or the other once you get the whole story
qy@	Have you seen any other movies? Because you sound like you see a lot.
bk	okay.
ba	there you go .
b	Oh.
bh	Really?
b	Oh.
sd	I'll have to write that down.
qy	Are you into, Larry McMurtry?
b	Yeah.
sd	I read a lot of Larry McMurtry books
sd	It's like very peculiar circumstances and very peculiar things that people do with each other
qw	What kind of painting are you planning to do?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and you get some beautiful effects with them.
sd	and then it had, a little bit darker sort of peachy color,
sd	and in between there was a sort of a rust, put on very sparingly.
sd	And it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that should be nice.
aa	Uh huh.
ad	I was about to say, you ought to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole thing .
sv	Because you might find that it's beyond, what you're willing to put into it. Although I think it could turn out really nice.
sd	I, never painted the outside.
sd	and my job was mostly the woodwork.
sd	and I got to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine, trim work, where I'd use a small brush and, try to keep the paint from dripping on the windows and things like that .
b	Uh huh.
qr	Well I was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip it.
ad	I would not recommend that method.
sv	if if you can rent a steamer, if it's modern wallpaper it should come off without too much trouble.
sv	If it's really old, you don't know what it's put on with.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	If it's paper it will probably shred.
sd	and then it had vivid, almost neon colors of hot pink and turquoise, and lime green and silver, and, a little bit of yellow that looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that .
sd(^q)	and he said it's a good thing I went to the bathroom before dinner because if I had had something to drink and went in there I would think I was having hallucinations .
b	Uh huh.
ad	and if you discover you like it then you can always upscale.
aa	Sure.
b	Yeah.
sv	and it can be done a whole lot faster. And with rollers and, modern latex paints,
sv	you can wash up easily because they're water soluble.
sv	And then if you discover the little tricks and tips about, you know, how you get through corners and how you do trim and, how long to leave the masking tape down, because if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake when you pull it up.
ad	You want it to get dry, but not, just real hard.
ba	That's the problem.
sd	but I've heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth. Because it rips as you pull it off for one thing
ad	But use good, stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands, that will go down and come up easily.
sd	I'd hire a professional.
sv	I think that could give it a,
sv	If you don't like it all you do is put on another coat.
fc	I guess we'd better go because our time looks like it's about up.
fc	bye bye.
fc	Thank you.
qy	did you, have you grown up in Dallas, Stephanie?
qw	where are you from?
b^m	In Germany.
sd	Now there's a place I'd like to visit .
b	Uh huh.
sd	and so we've seen lots of pictures of the beautiful, spots and, areas,
qo	What kind of vacations do you like?
bk	H ,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	when our children were younger, we lived up in, New York, or New Jersey and, and } used to like, traveling into upstate New York and camping
sd	Little bit of, , water skiing.
sd	But, not much of, of anything else.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It's really, they had, a really nice beach areas there.
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	you could, you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and just really,
qy^g	Not so much,
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	So your next, your plans are try to find someplace to scuba dive.
qy	You have any children?
sd	we had little children all the time,
sv	so some of the things are not quite as, adaptable.
sv	You have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy, too,
sd	but, maybe fifteen even.
sd	You know, we go wherever somebody is, that we haven't seen for a while .
sd	we just came back from, Grand Rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate, with his Master's Degree in social work
sd	and the summer we have a, a reunion in Salt Lake area up by Park Cities. Where we're going to camp for a week with as many members of a rather large reunion group as we can get together
b	Yeah.
sd	I guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep maybe, you know, like a, a small camper.
sv	I hate them because they're hard to jockey around, you know,
sv	but you wouldn't want to do it all the time.
sd	I would just love to just drive through the United States and stop and see people I know, and visit for a day and then go on and, you know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think, I think that would real,
sd	and I would like to maybe not take great long trips, but have your home base, where your home is and then just travel out for, like, maybe, a month, maybe go,
b	Yeah.
sv	interesting things to
sd^e	we took a trip, around to the, Civil War battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something,
sd	and, so we were ready to look up the places we read about.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, now, camping is fun with kids.
sv	but, but when they get a little bigger they can help,
sv	Very restful.
sv	I find the outdoors very relaxing and, you know, kind of a change.
sd	I need my creature comforts, too.
fc	Well, it was great to talk to you.
fc	Bye bye.
qo	Well, what do you think in terms of, benefits?
ny	Absolutely.
sd	You know, I was thinking about, importance of benefits and that kind of thing, other than salary while I was waiting for, the system to find a respondent.
sv	and I suspect that that's probably true for everyone.
sd	and the retirement is more important.
na	I think they have, one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves.
sd	And that's certainly one of the reasons that I'm sure that they've begun the, CODA Plan.
sd	It's certainly a supplemental way,
sv	and I suppose b , maybe in your instance, if you're started with T I in your early to mid twenties, and happen to stay with them until you're sixty five, then you'll have a very good retirement plan.
sd	But I had another career first and then came to T I a little later.
sd	all by itself it won't be adequate for, for my situation.
sd	So, I have to find a way to supplement that.
ba	I understand though,
sd	believe me, I do that myself.
sd	I don't think it's the worst investment, in the world.
sd	and maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed, until later.
sv	it's shown a history that, sure beats anything else. Over many, many years.
ba	I understand, that approach.
sd	That's, what, that's exactly what's happening in my family.
^q	all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there.
^q	You better make sure that you've got a scholarship.
sd(^q)	I have an eleven year old daughter now who's saying, gee, Dad, I want to be an allergist,
^q	Let, me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that.
sd	And, then } her little brother's only two years behind
^q	Let me explain to you how you get scholarships , to do that.
ba	Well, that's fantastic,
sv	and on whole I would say that they're equal to, most of our competitors.
sv	I can see some potential changes that probably are, would not cost very much but might, make things a little easier. Such as offering a smorgasbord. Having a larger variety of benefits
sv(^q)	but, but here's the amount, that T I is going to pay for it,
sv	it's menu selection, so, to speak.
sv	Well, I could certainly, personally stand seeing them go to a standardized compensatory time for overtime.
sv	And I don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days, if they did, that.
sv	or, you know, maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one. as a repayment for, every three to five days that I work overtime there, they should give me one day.
sv	But it should be a standard and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate that's running in each department.
aa	Well, that's for sure.
sv	I'm sure personalities always come into play.
sv^t	Well this is a subject that you never think you'll be assigned to . One that kind of comes up when you've lost the others, other subjects.
sv	for the balloon festival here in Plano it was just gorgeous.
sv	It couldn't have been better.
sv	so you dress up warm,
sd	That's the only thing wrong I can find with it.
ba	how fun.
sd	I miss that,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Ooh.
sv	I guess you have to take some things and leave some things.
sd	and they're gorgeous
sd	you could spend every weekend of the fall going to a different area.
sv	it's kind of hazardous for driving
sd	We've only lived here a couple of years.
sv	but then we're back to being warmer than normal this week, or last week,
qy^d	I mean, nothing comparable, I guess, to what you've had before.
aa	You're right.
sd	and no one can drive on ice.
sv	but then when you decided what ice was .
fc	So, well, I think we've discussed it good enough today.
fc	It was, It was good talking to you.
fc	Maybe we'll get the next time.
fc	Take care.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	I live in the Florida in the winter and then go back up north in the summertime
sd	I, I, I guess I do watch, MCNEIL LEHRER on P B S because I lean to that coverage,
sd	We seem to start dinner around six and finish it up.
sv	but it's coverage, you know.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think this is scandalous the way everybody's picking on him.
sv	I think he reported what he saw
sv	and if you didn't like it, that was just too bad, you know.
sd	or, I, I also subscribe to something called WORLD PRESS, which is a magazine that only talks about other, excerpts from the WORLD PRESS,
sd	it's not as slanted as the NEW YORK TIMES or as biased perhaps as the local paper.
sd	and I also listen to, these twenty four hour news stations, when I'm driving.
qr	are you from Southern or Northern California?
qw	is that, what is that,
qy	the San Francisco paper out there is, the major paper?
ba	and that's a terrible paper.
qy	Is that pretty good?
qy^g	what is that, the CHRONICLE isn't it?
bk	Oh.
sd	they really are probably the worse papers I've ever read.
qy^g	That's a pretty decent paper isn't it
b	Yeah.
sd	not as in depth as I used to, because their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer
sd	I feel pretty well versed in what I'm doing because I do spend more time on that than I do, say, on sports, although I watch that,
sd	I find it very exciting for the coverage we have now, today.
sv	If anything, I think they list ,
sv	actually, I think they slant things
ba	wow!
bh	Yeah?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	if it said that. I feel I'm well enough equipped.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think yo , you got to segregate some of it.
fc	Well, that's about all I have to say .
fc	Bye bye.
o	Okay.
sd	but they're teenagers
sd	so I have three children, ages fifteen, seventeen and twenty
sd	and, I guess about when the youngest one was in kindergarten I started working at a preschool and, you know, doing some work,
sd	so so I am around, not a day care situation, but you know, in the child care environment
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yes.
aa	it is.
bf	in other words, there're more people,
sd	seeing the children in the school the way I do, I mean, I see the ones that, we can always tell the ones that have not been around children at all when they come in as three year olds as opposed to the ones that have been in the program, that started at twelve months maybe, and were were even in there one day a week which is all our school provides for the, you know for the under three year olds
sv	but still they have an opportunity to be with other children
sv	but I think that would, but as far as looking for a place, you know, the criteria, I mean, I think it's very important to have very caring people, you know to take care of the,
sv	in a school if you're going to have the structure and you're going to have the large numbers, you're going to need really,
b^r	yes,
aa	it is.
sv	that maybe have another salary in their family where they can do that,
sd	and that's what I had the opportunity of, you know, doing
sd	and I could concentrate on the creativity, and you know, really having a lot of fun with the children and and providing, them with a great atmosphere,
b	Yeah.
sv	And they have to be there at sometimes six o'clock in the morning.
aa^r	that's true.
sv	because people can't pay to provide and,
sd	and so we don't have the expenses of a building, you know
sd	but we don't have enough
sd	you know, taking care of a whole building and that responsibility.
sv	So, it is a lot different.
ba	my goodness.
b^m	yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes,
b^r	yeah.
aa^r	yes,
sv	I mean a lot of people do it really the reverse and go to work after the children are in school, you know.
aa	that's true.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	dear,
ba	dear,
ba	how awful,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah.
aa	yes,
ba	dear.
aa	Yes.
sd	and the crime here is pretty bad .
sd	I was going to say.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Have you ever been there?
qy	are you in college right now?
bk	okay.
qy	Are bases safe, you know?
bf	they, minimize the access.
sd	but it is pretty scary.
sd	You know, people put bars on their windows in certain neighborhoods
sv	But they are still bars .
sd	so I do not know you know, what can be done.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
sd	when she was jogging in Central Park, a couple of years ago?
b	Yeah.
sv	That is really stra .
sd	and they still can't catch them .
sd	in a small town in Wisconsin, near Madison, a young boy somehow got a hold of a shotgun. And killed his parents and his three brothers and sisters.
sd	and he had not, displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or whatever, you know.
sv	And you are thinking to yourself,
aa	I know.
sv	I just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more.
sd	And, you know. It was sort of like there were boundaries.
sv	And I do not know, I think today a lot of parents, are ruled by their kids.
sd	It is an attitude like the world owes them something.
bh	Do you?
qy	Are you in the Air Force?
bk	Okay.
b	Sure.
b	Huh.
b	Right.
sv	And the Air Force is one of the better supposedly m , m , military experiences.
br	Pardon me?
sd	but, I do not talk to many people in the military.
sd	And you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your leotards.
sv	or where they are at, you know.
sd	And it is about seven hours.
sv	That is a very, very neat town to visit. in terms of the French Quarter and all of the things you hear about.
sd	How to carry your wallet,
ny	yeah.
sd	She had been dating a fellow for several weeks.
sd	They went back to her dorm room
sd(^q)	But I just looked at the picture and thought, what a world.
sd	I mean, I do not,
sd	I do not have any, cure,
sd	everybody wants your business kind of thing.
sd	I mean, I basically have started not to trust anybody in general street smarts.
sd(^q)	But I just said, Howard,
fe	my God.
sv	You should not deny yourself going to visit and all that.
qy	are you from Boston?
sd	Home Owners Savings and Loan in Boston.
sd	But, I mean, I never felt any safer there than I did in any other city I have been in, you know.
sv	Do not deny yourself the New York bu , experience, but go with people that you know.
sd	I am not real big on guns myself.
sd	and then they are out doing it again.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I mean, people that may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	god.
sv	You know, it is just, I think kids get too much too fast. And all those sort of things.
sd	In Atlanta, where my inlaws live, they had that thing, you know, the high top sneakers, the Air Jordans, et cetera.
sd	Kids killing each other and beating their brains out.
sd	or the jackets, the team like the Raiders and the caps.
sd	That is probably one of the most bizarre I have heard of.
sd	Where they videotape themselves.
sv	You probably, more up on this subject than I am,
aa	You bet.
sd	in the last half of dozen years I see more and more women traveling.
sd	and, you know, it's a credit to them as far as how they're doing things.
aa	You bet.
ba	That's sort of neat.
sv	and they're doing the same, or carrying the same job responsibility
sv	and it shouldn't be that way. You know.
sv	I hope so,
aa	Absolutely.
sv	a woman Congressman I'm sure makes as much as a man Congressman and the same as a senator or whatever.
sd	you see, more and more ladies of all ages with briefcases and in their business suits and and going.
sv	in the future it's even going to be, more noticeable and more significant.
ba	Wow.
ba	Good point.
sd	and hers was the only income we had for three or four months
sd	and she still works everyday
aa	You bet.
b	Uh oh.
qw	What kind of work do you do?
ba	Well, good.
qy^d	Married?
sd^t	Well, trying to think what else I can say in regards to this subject.
qy^d	You see the old, cigarette ads, you know, about you've come a long way.
na	right,
qy	Have you had that experience recently?
b	yeah.
b	Oh.
sd	Well, I don't have so much trouble with products as service.
sd	I've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because I've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly.
sd	And I'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent.
sd	the one I have now is okay, most of the time.
sd	but it's a very good company. That sells sterling silver things
sd	and she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it, a lot of money into it by now
sd(^q)	and they said this was just obviously yanked.
sd	I mean they were so rude about it.
^q	so do it anyway.
sd	I felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable
sd	I didn't even know the person's name that had given me the hard time or anything
sd	They might work on that, you know.
sv	Service is more of a problem.
ba	Really.
ba	That's really great.
b	Huh.
sv	I don't think most places are like that anymore.
sv	Well, on this subject of invasion of privacy, yes, it's very easy for anybody to find out about you.
sd	the special on channel thirteen that was broadcast, I think, last week or so ago, it detailed how this one person went about finding out from this particular person his home mortgage, how much he pays for it, what his payments are, his, Social Security number, driver's license, any kind of records he may have. their credit card and the status of their credit.
sd	It was just as a demonstration to show those who were watching it how easily obtainable information is on any single person.
sd	mostly it dealt with, marketing companies, these, direct marketing, associations.
sd	And they're able to do that through all the manipulations of the computer.
b	Uh huh.
qy^m	The open office?
b	Yeah.
sv	Not insofar as maybe making conversation with somebody, I suppose, because you can easily be overheard
sv	I suppose any items that you have laying out can be easily seen.
b^m	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you work with, mixed company, male and female
sv	I suppose it depends on who you're working for and where at.
sv	but, I guess we're changing ever so rapidly in the devices of communications that anything can be obtained from anybody's record,
sv	and it appears in front of them,
sv	I know the government sells information to private companies about individuals or families.
sv	and it shouldn't be that way I don't think.
^h	I'll tell you that.
sv	But, I don't see anything like that to occur unless everybody bands together to do that.
sv	But it's hard to define a lot of those boundaries.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	So you've received a lot of, flack?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Is that usually what you tell them in the letter?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Good idea.
qy	any other problems?
fc	I'm clouding up right now.
fc	Well, it's nice talking to you.
fc	Maybe again.
fc	Bye bye.
sv	but, I guess I would say it's not easy to find what most parents would want.
sv	You'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care.
sv	For profit places, I would really look at them awfully carefully
sd	so I felt confident that they'd do right.
qy^h@	you mean, learning type, yeah ? I mean actual experiments they would have to get your permission.
sv	pretty good people .
b	Uh huh.
sd	so, I never really worried too much about that the case with my boys.
sv	you know, I think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them
sv	I don't think it's as common as, the newspapers would make you believe .
aa	I mean that,
sd	and, so I would always trust her judgment on that.
b	Uh huh.
ad	so, yeah, do it as long you can .
sv	and you have to get a feel for, how they treat the kids and, what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you commit your child to them.
sv	and if they're at all queasy about that then I'd look elsewhere, yeah.
qy	You have other friends that have kids, being taken care of in, child care?
sv	But, I really think the news reports tend to sensationalize the problems.
sv	I think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and, pay and exhaustion and , you know, things like that, rather than these, really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy.
b	Yeah.
qo	So, what do you think about child care .
b	Right.
qy^d	Just because of the,
sv	they seem to pass a lot of,
sv	you kind of wonder whether or not,
sd	it was a preschool day care type of thing.
sv	I think the ratio of kids to teacher is really important.
sd	so that was probably my own fault that she didn't,
sd	and, I didn't notice it until this summer when I was working with her that she would bend her wrist all the way, not in a natural form.
sd	she was holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff.
aa	Yes.
sd	like I said, I didn't notice it till then. Because I hadn't worked with writing letters or anything and stuff like that.
sd^e	They never,
sd	my main reason for taking her was, just social skills more than anything else.
sd	just, I didn't feel like she was mature enough socially
sv	but I think it's hard to take kids to somebody you don't know or unless you have awfully good references. Reliable, people,
sv	it's so hard to take young kids anywhere for very long.
sv	and they usually adapt pretty well.
sv	and you know if they're upset and that type of a deal.
sv	and you haven't got anything done
^q	what am I going to fix for supper .
^q	is this important what I'm doing
aa	No.
^q	are they driving the baby sitter crazy
sd	Our community doesn't really have any organized recycling drive.
sd	I live in San Antonio.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and there was discussion for a while about, building a garbage burning, electric generation plant
sd	but it just wasn't cost effective, at the time.
sd	I recycle my newspapers and, my aluminum stuff.
sd	it's not very convenient to do.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yes.
sd	where I work now we recycle all the computer paper.
sd	But that's about the extent of it.
aa^r	yeah,
sv	And I'm sure that the, driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so.
sd	We sell the paper back to a paper manufacturing company.
sv	not by much, but it does defray it some.
sv	Enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building.
b	Yeah.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah.
sd	Not the cheap ones of course. And packed everything up and moved them and left them lying around,
sd	and they're good boxes.
sd	And they were just going to throw them away.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
sd	you can unfold them.
sd	So, you know, they don't take up much storage space.
sd	I felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until I realized they would be thrown away,
sd	I thought, well I was doing them a favor by taking them.
b	Yeah.
sd	so you can't use it anyway.
sd	and the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in, with the nice lids. Those get thrown away.
sd	And I am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes.
sd	Those are perfect boxes to put files in.
sd	but I would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids,
sd	and you can stack them up and leave them out and put things in them, even.
aa	yeah.
sd	well, you know, it's cheaper than going and buying the kind at Target that are all ready with the little design on them or whatever.
aa	yeah.
aa	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	in fact I think there's two of them, that have several openings,
sd	and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category,
sd	but it's real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I mean, you have to get so used to doing it that it's a habit.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
^2	And someone else isn't going to take the time to put it in two separate bags.
b	Uh huh.
fc	Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.
fc	bye.
o	There we go.
sv	So. So I think we're a little ahead of schedule on that.
sd	but the break is over.
sd	now, the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny.
sv	but I'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend.
b	Yeah.
sd	I haven't heard whether it's going to rain or not.
ba	Well, that's good.
sd	but I think the average high should be about seventy.
b	Yeah.
sv	And what that tells me, is that the summer weather is very predictable, that it doesn't vary very much.
sd	I mean, any other time of year, that's not the case, because it could be very warm or very cold.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	One of the weirdest things I saw, I think it was around this time last year was a twenty six degree lightening storm.
sd(^q)	And I thought, Well gee, I've never known it to lightening at that temperature.
sd	The cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn't get away.
aa	Nope.
sv	Well, this has been interesting.
sv	Not too challenging to the brain.
fc	well you have a good day.
fc	Bye.
qo	what do you think the major cause of air pollution or at least in the Boston areas,
b	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah.
sd	interestingly some of the information I've been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from, airplanes is extraordinary.
ny	Yeah,
sv	and that's always something that, you know, you don't think about.
sv	apparently the air pollution and the fact that it's delivered right up in high altitudes is a very significant factor.
aa^r	Yeah.
^2@	Society , has especially recently .
qw	I mean you know what it's like here.
aa^r	yeah.
sv	So, solutions to this, would be
sd	Well, I guess the, to me the first thing is I wish society would get as upset about this as you do get, getting people upset about animal rights.
sv	if we can't send people to the moon, that we can't improve these things.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, and also to make it economically feasible. and also in buses.
qy^d	I don't know if you ever got caught in a traffic jam behind a bus,
b^r	uh huh.
sv	but even, of course, in the longer term just to get away from fossil fuels.
sv	but I don't think, fossil fuels are the answer.
b	Yes
sv	you don't throw the baby out with the bath water, and condemning nuclear use.
aa^r	yeah.
sv	But with the pollution issue, fossil fuel is not the way to go anyway.
sv	so you've got to look elsewhere.
sd	one is already in college in New England,
sd	and we just feel that when we leave, this area, we're going north, not south.
sd	and I also like the fresher air up there.
sd	So, I mean that's the way we will be going.
sd	so, i , I'd be interested in having spoken with somebody also from the far west on this issue to see how their attitudes are.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
sv	I mean, even California was notorious for its smog years ago, before it even was an issue, out here.
sv	Well, that's, that's person , that's personal air pollution .
fc	And let's hope there are other people that feel the same way .
fc	You're welcome.
na	I do .
qo	what do you think about them?
sd	and, I just got it about six months ago
sv	and I find that it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally wouldn't get .
b	Yeah.
ba	my goodness.
sd	I made a rule with myself when I got one that if I couldn't pay it in full every month that I'd have to rip it up,
aa	Yeah,
sd	And they they can't do anything but work to try to pay them off.
sd	and she only earns like two hundred dollars a month because she's going to school.
sd	I guess you have to pay like twenty dollars each month is the
sd	so all she's paying is interest on hers every month.
sv	It just seems crazy to me
b	Yeah.
bh	really?
qy	Was a Visa card?
ba	my goodness.
sd	I'm about sick of mine right now.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	They are against it .
sd	I don't think they like the fact that I have one either.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I'm twenty right now.
sd	So, just going to school and working
sd	and I needed a pair of shoes
sd	so I just went out and bought them on my credit card.
qy	So do you just have two kids
bh	really?
sd	I'm from Plano, Texas.
sd	But right now I'm out in Provo, Utah going to B Y U
ny	Yep .
sv^t	But, this is a extra long one.
sv^t	They're giving us a lot of time .
qy^t	Have you done a lot of this?
bh	really?
qy^t	Do you do it every day?
qo	What kind of eating out do you enjoy?
b	Right .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qr	Do you go like home cooking, like Black Eyed Pea and that kind of thing or cafeteria?
sd	We do the same.
qw	What are your favorite places?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and we think that was real good
sd	but our favorite when you have a little more to spend, is to go to Taiwan or May Dragon.
sd	They're really a nice place you could take someone to eat.
sd	It's not the rinky Chinese decorations
sd	but it's a very elegant nice place to eat.
sd	my husband has just gotten stuck.
sd	And we go to On the Border. And lots of places that have, I think
sd	and he'll just eat chips until we've got three or four baskets coming back.
sd	and for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend to want to go eat lasagna and garlic bread .
sd	So, we went to El Sorrento.
^q	we're going to have to go."
sd	in fact, you're about the third or fourth person in the last month that said that.
sd	So I guess we'll have to do it.
sd	It said there was always a line.
sv	But I mean that's a good, that's a good sign.
sd	Now, my kids didn't like it because they just wanted to get plain old spaghetti or lasagna,
sd	and most of those things were a little more northern Italy.
sd	They're not very,
aa^r	Exactly.
sv	The place of the seventies .
sv	most kids do.
qy	do you ever go for steak? Just a steak and potato and salad bar, that kind of thing.
sd	I can't remember his name.
sv	and they have these really corny radio commercials
sd	My husband was saying that up north they have such nice restaurants where you can go after a theater or after the movie.
sd	And then they, closed up .
sv	So most of these places are pretty much just, theme restaurants around here.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	That's right.
sd	I had a friend who was taken to Lawry's downtown for prime rib
sd	We usually don't go for beef really anymore.
sd	we've gotten so used to doing chicken and things at home that that's usually the way we'll go if we're not going lasagna.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, I understand.
sv	and save you some money too .
qw	now what's your child's favorite place to eat?
sv	They're easy .
b	Yeah .
sd	They like to go pretty much where we like to go
sd	so not Pizza Inn, but pizza to our house.
qy	Well, is there anything else you'd like to discuss about it?
fc	Thank you.
fc	Bye bye.
qo	What do you think about capital punishment?
qw	Which crimes do you feel that?
sd	so many times it's so brutal and just recurrent
sv	selling, I think should also.
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
sd	Texas, I saw on T V the other night, has had forty six in like the past several years.
sd	They do it by lethal injection, at Huntsville.
aa	Yeah .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	in fact, a big gubernatorial issue is the the turnover rates of, repeat offenders being let out and doing it again.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I wish if they were going to do it, they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't.
sv	not being able to put it off for fifteen years.
bh	really?
ba	Goodness.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
sv	yeah I tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little too lenient.
sv	kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty.
sd	I'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas.
sd	audiology.
qw	What do you do?
bh	really.
bh	Oh really?
ba	Neat.
sd	this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in California.
sd	the forty sixth in the last twenty five years I think is what
sd	they gave a run down that Texas Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then .
sv	I mean, it just seems, Yeah, it just seemed a little inconsistent.
sd	you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when ever you know.
sd^e	I don't think, the military doesn't execute anymore
sd	Or death before the firing squad or whatever.
o	return anything.
b	Right.
sv	maybe those type of products should be for older kids .
sd	I have a five and a half and a three and a half year old that play with them .
sd	and they're easily lost and easily broken
bf	It's been a while since they've, gone through the Barbie stuff .
b	Right.
b^m	Don't remember her breaking,
sd	camping on the beach, and all of these come with, like tiny, tiny little plates and little sunglasses.
sd	and, less than a week later the arm was broken.
sd	That's one nice thing, is they're real good about replacing it.
sd	Well, the, you know, those little arms are supposed to twist almost any way
sd	she's not that strong, that I would she's not that big of a girl that I think could really take a grip on it like a bigger kid could, you know.
b	Yes.
b^m	That was about it.
sv	And the Barbie doll itself is usually pretty durable and that kind of stuff
bh	is that right?
qy	Well, do you see that there's a big problem with electronic things?
b	Yes.
b	yeah. .
sv	Well, you almost assume if you're going to have problems with it, it's usually before that warranty would expire
b	You never even needed it.
b^m	It's time to replace it.
sv	I think these extended warranties are gimmicks, really.
sd	and it was ridiculous.
sv(^q)	you always think gosh, if I say no, then I won't, you know.
h	I don't know.
sv	You probably got your worth out of it anyway.
qy^d	and when you do buy things, you probably watch what type of .
b	Yes.
qo	What do you think about the, Peace Corps or public service commitment?
sv	but there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from, some sort of public service, like the Conservation Corps back in the thirties or, various other things of that sort.
sd	but I don't quite see how they'd make it work.
qh	How would they decide who goes into, building fire breaks in Yosemite National Park and who goes to Saudi Arabia?
sv	the difficulty would be in whether it's voluntary or involuntary.
sd	And the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary, that it should be like a draft.
sd	and some people would get civilian, service, like working in hospitals.
sd	or farm work in World War One I remember reading about.
sv	and I suppose that there is, justification for taking everybody if you take anybody.
sv	But I just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them, sorting them out, assigning them, training them would be insurmountable.
aa	well it's a possibility.
sd	Well, I think that in the cases like that, they had to be, pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth, and that this wasn't something new just to keep out of going to war.
sd	It was, something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life.
sv	and, in addition to that, we have the cost because you have to pay something for, their room and board
sv	and then you have to pay them some kind of a stipend, even if it's like the Peace Corps where they don't get most of it until they come home, you have to pay them something.
b	yeah.
sd	Now I had a lot of friends who went to the Peace Corps, back in the mid sixties
sd	I don't, know what we got for all the money.
sv	We had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to, what was then East Pakistan is now Bangladesh, and to, Algeria and to, Southeast Asia and lots of, out of the way places.
sd	But I don't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went, in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	They were not drafting you and sending you, against your will.
qy	Do you think that would be a good idea?
sd	I don't either.
sd	And they, do forestry work.
sd	and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort.
sd	I'm not so sure what kind of, training that is for the future for those kids.
sv	but whether it's something that they can put to economic use later on is a different subject.
ba	Good point ,
fc	but my other line is blinking.
fc	But it was good to talk to you.
qo	Well, what do you know about Latin American policies?
o@	 Are you, relating this, to the, affair we've got going on in Haiti right now?
ba	that's just it.
sv	but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance.
b	Right.
b	Right.
aa	That's true.
aa	Sure.
sd	she was from El Salvador
qy^d	Marcos
sd	Marcos is Philippines,
qy^d	Well, you know who I'm talking about.
sv	anyway, when he came into power, he basically just took everybody's property, you know, just assigned it to himself.
sv	and in that respect I have to agree that I think we're taking the right stance because they were a democracy turned,
aa	right
sv	basically a dictator fascist.
qo	Well, what do you think of, this, U S free trade agreement we're working on with Mexico?
b	Uh huh.
sv	and a lot of the larger Mexican businesses are trying to, make themselves Americanized, I guess which is great because that's what they basically need to do.
sv	The big problem with the United States is we have our basic nine to five schedule you know,
sd	and we don't have the Siesta,
sv	and we've had our way of life,
qo	what kind of hobbies do you have?
sd	I started reading the newspaper, and kind of forgot about it .
sd	I'd say reading is probably one of my biggest ones, because it's the type of thing that you can do a little bit at a time, whereas, I would love to do crafts and stuff if I just had the time to do it or if I had the space.
sd	so I couldn't really leave it out if I was working on something.
sv	Reading is a little bit easier to work around.
aa	That's right.
sd	I do the same thing .
qo	What types of crafts do you do?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	And, back when I was in high school, I worked at a needlework shop,
sd	But I have recently done some cross stitch.
sv	it's just getting the time to do it .
b	Uh huh .
sd	Wrong .
sd	But I was wrong.
sd	I enjoyed it.
ba	my gosh.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's pretty understandable.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I was tonight,
b	Yeah.
sd	they live in Duncanville
sd	So they are always borrowing my tapes.
sd	But haven't done that yet.
sd	I probably should go buy some.
sd	I'm not real crazy about pulling weeds and things like that.
sd	I like the planting, and watering is okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but I don't always get direct sun except in certain spots.
sd	And so that's probably my problem there.
sd^e	I never have tried that, just because I don't have that much space on this little porch here in this apartment or this little balcony.
sd	And I think when I was real little I probably had a finger in on that every time he did it and had to be out there and watch and that type of stuff.
sd	But I've never really tried anything like that since then.
b	Uh huh.
ba	wow.
b	Uh huh.
ny^r	yeah
sd	and sure enough, boy the fur just came off like crazy once I got them in the tub.
sd	They went and hid after they got dried off.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	to me, dogs need a yard, even little dogs.
sv	But I just think dogs need to be outside, though.
ba	now that's an idea
sv	even a cat, you never know when they might bite or scratch or something.
sd	But with little ones, I'd be kind of scared , to get anything that has teeth or claws.
b	yeah.
b	yeah .
fc	and I'm out of good ideas for a hobby anyway.
fc	Well it was good talking to you.
fc	Bye bye.
qy	Do you see anything wrong with public school systems?
aa	I agree.
sd^e	and I taught for fourteen years before we moved to Texas,
sd	and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that I was filling out all these forms for all the children
sd	it was filled with documentation
aa	yes.
sd	Me, too.
sv	They're so worried about lawsuits and the scores the children get on tests now and teacher competency, you know,
sv	she's always worried whose looking over her shoulder
aa	I know.
qy	Do you have children in the system?
bk	Oh.
qy	Are you in Plano?
sd	I am too.
sd	and it didn't work then
sd	and when we moved down here, I was just appalled that they were still doing it here,
sd	I know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school
sd	so he spent all day in this one large open area,
sd	It seems like the schools in Michigan were much better than they are down here.
sd	That was our last tour, in Michigan.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	wow.
aa	Yes.
sd	We heard wonderful things about it until we actually got in the system.
aa	Probably so, on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are
qy	As a freshman?
b	Yep.
sd	so and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of home work I would expect for a freshman to have.
sd	but yet she has some every night.
qh	but, who knows what he's going to bring home.
qw	well, Myrna, how do you get your news?
b	Yeah.
sd	And I really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast.
aa	tha , yeah, that's true.
aa	yeah.
sd	a lot of times I eat while I'm watching the news.
qo	what did you think about the coverage like over in the, Persian Gulf?
sv	and then, you know, the special reports and the extended news coverage I thought was really good.
b	Yeah.
aa^r	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
ba	well that's great.
sv	or if you have a break in the middle of the day, you take a coffee break you can always stay informed.
sd	I think that's, that really has changed the way, I look at the news.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and then you could go on, you know, to do what else you wanted to do.
sd	So television is my main new source.
b	Uh huh.
qy	to commute to work?
bk	Oh.
sd	that's necessary.
b^m	Yeah.
sd	you could say I'm in Baltimore.
qy	in Baltimore?
b	Uh huh.
sv	that's, that's a really nice area, Bethesda area.
sd	and, the closer you get to Washingt , D C the more expensive it is.
sd	most people have relocated to the Washington area, you know.
sd	I don't really bother with the Washington station because it's so far removed from what I'm interested in.
sd	they've gotten rid of that really bad mayor and then, brought in,
sv	You know, from what I pick up on the news, it's a difficult process, you know, to get rid of a bad mayor.
b	Right.
b	yeah.
sv	but Germantown is a nice area.
sv	It's a nice area .
qy	Are they driven by themselves.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
qy	They didn't call you for Mother's Day?
qy	You weren't home?
fc	Well I guess we should stop now.
fc	Hey, thanks a lot, and bye.
qo	How do you feel about public schools?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I have a sister who used to live in Kennesaw, Georgia.
sd	And she complained quite a bit about their school system there.
b	Right.
sd	I really don't come from here
sd	but I live in Orlando, Florida usually.
sd	They're pretty good.
sd	But I know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good.
sd	and he says the schools there are just terrible.
ba	Wow.
sd	That is slow.
b	Uh huh.
qo	What do you think's wrong to cause that?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
am	Perhaps.
b	Yeah.
sd	that's one thing I worry about .
b	uh huh.
sv	Probably quite a few black people up there
bh	is that right?
bk	okay.
sv	but then again.
sv	you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand, especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school.
sv	you can't do that.
sd	See, I grew up in Nebraska
sd	we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking, twenty seven, thirty kids to a class.
sd	I, I was, I was doing mathematics, fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade, easily.
sv	With all this, don't hurt the kids and don't abuse their rights, you've also taken something away from the discipline, I think.
b	Yeah.
qw	what are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful .
qw	well how old are you?
qy^d	so you ha , you have been to some family reunions, perhaps.
qw	Now how long in advance do they, let them know?
bk	Uh huh.
bf	So they all know it.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Yes.
qy	do they all have the small children too, that come?
qy^d	So all ages.
sd	Well my husband on one side has an extended family,
sd	and they don't ever plan it as, like you do.
sd	so they have to start talking about it, or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody, because they're rather socially active too.
sd	but six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them.
sd	my parents are the youngest of very large families.
sd	Therefore, they don't have many people left.
sd	I have one sister, and three brothers
sd	and they're only three out of five of us who have children.
sd	So, we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other.
sd	And that's kind of nice because my husband's family reunions are so large,
sd	we don't really know many of them.
sd^r	they're a lot of fun,
sv	and, you kind of forget what happened, and who they were from the time before.
qy	those are the ones that are in Texas?
qrr	Or you go to Indiana on that?
qw	where in Indiana?
sd	I used to live in Indianapolis.
sv	it's gorgeous.
qw	when is your next one, scheduled now.
qy	and do you think you'll have a baby to take back with you .
b^m	Maybe .
sv	I mean you need another milestone, you know.
qy^d	and then all of your family probably has not met your husband.
bh	is he?
qy^d	and your both living in Sherman.
qy	and does he?
sd	but, I have a friend who, is working on this project.
ny	Yes,
sd	I have a hard time getting, people on the telephone.
sd	But I got off that.
fc	well, I think we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes.
fc	And, we both look forward to going to our next reunions, I'm sure.
fc	But it has been fun talking to you.
fc	Thank you.
fc	good.
qw	Where do you enjoy dining out?
qy	do you have children?
qy^g	that makes a difference, doesn't it.
qw	What area of the country do you live in?
sd	I am, too.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	Yes.
sd	and my husband and I like getting the salads or the lighter meals
sd	and we can have a salad bar
sd	so sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a Wendy's, because it's all either McDonald's or Dairy Queens,
aa	that's right,
aa	I know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Well, what are some of your favorite inexpensive places?
b	Uh huh.
sd	we are Little Caesar fans here
sd	that's where we always go,
sd	we like Grandy's, too.
b	Oh.
qw	Where do you go if you like to have a nice meal out, or a big meal?
qw	Where do you go for steaks?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	You ever been to Houston's on Belt Line?
sd	That's where we go to get steaks
sd	and you wind up waiting about an hour
sd	then you can go right through.
sd	We don't usually take the kids when we go there,
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
sd	so we have a conflict of interests on the weekend.
b	Right.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	Yep.
o	Okay .
sd	I mean, I, I, I tend to read like only out of a couple, you know, groups.
sd	so I tend to read a lot of the baseball books
sd	And, I read a lot of science fiction.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And of course, I don't ever get around to reading them .
sd	I belong to Quality Paperback Book Club.
sd	Like I got BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM, you know, like a couple of years ago.
sd	and it's like eight hundred pages .
sd	And it was like, I want to read something else for a while .
b	Yeah.
sd	BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM starts off, you know, in the eighteen forties, you know. And it's like,
sv	but you know, it's hard sometimes.
sd	I read a lot of science fiction.
ny	Yeah.
sd	there's one science fiction writer named, Allen Dean Foster.
sd	I must have like fifty or sixty books by him .
sd	I mean, you know, I have well, almost everything he's ever done.
 sd	And, you know, I know that you know, when I get his book I'm usually going to enjoy it.
sv	it's fun to do that.
sd	Well, he does a lot of like, movie adaptations and things like that.
sv	And, his adaptations are usually really good.
sd	But it turns out that, Foster actually, ghost wrote it for him.
sd	when I read it, I should have realized that because, I mean, it had Foster's style written all over it .
ny	Yeah.
na	I'm sure he does .
sd	Well, I mean he's doing all right, probably .
ba	That's true.
sv	you're aware of that kind of thing .
b	Uh huh.
sd	So I'm,
sd	but, I was mostly interested in the baseball stuff.
no	actually I'm a Red Sox fan more than anything.
ny	Yeah.
sd	but, I, I do like the Orioles also.
b	Yeah .
sv	Toledo.
sd	Went to a Mud Hens double header .
sd	I saved that issue, actually.
sd	it was a lot of fun.
h	I don't,
sd	but I don't know if they play, in the same location.
sd	minor league, baseball, I think is a lot more fun than, major league baseball.
sd	And it's a lot cheaper .
sd	It's about forty miles west.
sd	And I go out there almost as much as the Orioles
sd	and it's just great.
sd	the ch , the cheapest ticket you can normally get is like six fifty to seven fifty.
sd	And, hot dogs like start at a dollar fifty .
ba	that's nice.
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you know offhand?
sd	But we're getting a new stadium next year
sd	And they're saying how there's going to be a lot more parking for the stadium.
sd	And, I'm not going to be able to do that downtown .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Weren't you guys, supposed to get a stadium in downtown Dallas?
bf	it didn't, go through.
bk	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	that's what I'd always heard,
b	Uh huh.
sd	That's about what it takes me to get to Memorial.
sd	And it takes me almost the same amount of time to go to Frederick, as it does to go to the ballpark in, Baltimore. Because, to go out to Frederick, I just jump on the Interstate
sd	because I live just south of the Interstate.
sd	and the stadium's right off the Interstate .
sd	but I've got to go, stop and go traffic and everything.
sv	but you don't read many sports books
b	Uh huh.
sd	I understand there was a really good basketball book called, A SEASON ON THE BRINK.
sd	It was like John Feinstein or something like that wrote it.
sd	I just heard about it the other night.
sd	I was listening to something on the radio about, you know, a talk show about sports books,
sd	and they mentioned that one.
sd	I saw a book kicking around on the history of the A B A, which,
sd	they do it to prisoners
sd	you know, I would not mind it.
b	Right.
bf	unless an employer has a reason to believe that the work competency of the employee is hurting the business.
sv	Number one because generally if they are involved in that type of thing they are into theft
sv	it's not going to be wholesale because of the cost.
sd	but my concern is, school bus drivers.
sd	I'm concerned in the medical field.
sv	I, I think they should screen for alcohol in these areas, too because I consider that a drug.
sv	But when you consider they could be driving an airplane or driving a bus, or a train,
sv	They don't have to be totally roaring drunk
sv	just a little off on their timing could mean life.
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
ba	my word.
bf	Control.
sv	Well, as long as you accept that it is a random testing you know, to alleviate,
sv	that way you can't feel like somebody's out to get me.
sv	it's almost like being selected for jury duty .
sv	that's just the way it is.
sv	I would rather have it that way, to know that I was chosen at random by a computer than to think that somebody turned me in because I think when you let other employees turn in people,
aa	Right.
sv	if somebody does observe you say at a party, using drugs I would think that it would be their obligation to report that.
aa	Right.
sv	but there would be, even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that was that way.
b	Right.
sv	I just think employers have to have, especially given today, the drug abuse that goes on, I just think employers have to have some kind of way to see that they're not being put at risk. * slash error Because they're the ones who are going to have the lawsuits, the insurance claims, et cetera,
sv	and I'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims aren't due to, illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b^r	uh huh.
qy	is it, just a small group of the employees that are concerned?
bf	they just don't want to be drug tested.
sd	You know, my husband and I have never been in a situation where somebody said you have to be drug tested.
sd	my husband's retired from I R S agents.
sd	However, this isn't a problem that we have either alcohol or drug,
sd	and so, we, in our minds we're thinking what's the big deal.
sd	and then they say, well, if you give them the right to do this, then they're going to take some other right away from you,
sd^t	I guess our topic is, advice about going to college.
qy	Do you have children of your own?
qy	are you?
qw	What school are you going to?
qy	Are you enjoying it?
qy	Are you working on your, Bachelor's degree?
qw	And what field of study are you in?
b	Uh huh.
qy	Are you from North Carolina?
bh	are you really?
qw	Well, what took you to North Carolina?
bk	I see.
sd	I went to Texas Tech out in Lubbock and, I had a friend, my roommate went to Tech also,
sd	but she was from New Mexico
sd	and she had to pay out of state tuition
sd	and I think that would have, played a real big part of my decision
sd	It was like four dollars a semester hour
sd	and she was paying forty dollars an hour
sd	so she paid ten times as much because she was out of state.
sd	so I think that would be one thing I would definitely consider try to find a school within the state that, I liked well enough to attend.
b	yeah.
b	right.
sd	but, it was wonderful, because I got one of those grants that you don't have to repay
sd	it paid most of my tuition, and, a lot of the book costs and that kind of thing
b	I really,
br	I'm sorry, what did you say?
sd	Well, it was called a B E O G, a Basic Equal Opportunity Grant
sd	My parents had five children and really didn't make enough money to send any of us to school.
sd	And so, because based on the number of children and the amount of money, my father brought in, I got a small grant
sd	So then I got a real big grant, because the amount of money I was making really didn't compare .
sd	I don't know if those are still available or not,
sd	so I went to school about three years of my four for almost nothing,
sv	it was really nice.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's right.
sd	I didn't know that.
sd	Well, I guess the only comparison I had ever heard was between a Christian college, because I thought about attending Abilene Christian instead of Texas Tech
bh	Really?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	you're just a number.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I'd like to have a Corvette.
sd	But my, weekly wages don't apply for me to have that kind of car,
sd	so, I'll more likely get a car for economic reasons.
sd	so probably a economic size car or,
sd	It's a piece of ,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	right .
b	Right.
sd	I forgot about that.
qrr	or is it real high up there?
sd	I mean that insurance is high dollars.
b	Right.
b	yeah.
qw	What's everybody drive up there?
qrr	or, do you all need four wheel drives up there because of snow and everything?
sd	it never snows down here,
bh	Really?
qy^g	Kind of strange to you all,
sd	it's like seventy degrees here right now.
qw	how cold is it there?
bh	Really?
b	Huh.
bh	Really?
qw	But, so what is your dream car?
qw	What's your favorite color?
ny	Yeah.
bh	Blue?
b^r	right.
qw	So, what kind of car do you drive right now?
bh	Really?
bh	Really?
bh	Really?
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
qy	does everybody have their windows tinted up there?
sd	Everybody has tinted down here.
qy	So, you been down here before?
qy	Did you like it?
sd	it's different I bet,
b	Right .
qy^t	Do you want to start?
sv	I suppose I should have,
sd	I guess, I hate to see anyone die,
 sv	but, I guess these people that go around and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse, I don't think they deserve to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
 %	and, a ,
sv	They are almost like a big star.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv(^q)	Well, I, I think if they went according to, the BIBLE where it does say, an eye for an eye,
 sv	you take a life you give yours.
sv	but, you know, most of these people that down right go right and do it out of pure pleasure I don't, like to see that.
sv	it is a deterrent in the sense that that person will never do it again .
sv	Not, not, not if he's killed he can't, do it again.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	but, repeat, crimes maybe not the more mild ones but, you know, more severe ones especially on armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people, and not just taking the money but beating them half to death.
sv	and I guess you've got to look at something like that.
bh	Do they deserve to, remain on this earth too?
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I like the adventure of it. And the idea that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space.
sd	The STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION. Which it's an all new cast, but kind of the same idea, going out to new places and doing new things and finding out about different people,
sd	and I've always liked that show probably the very best.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And I guess most of the shows I like are, are kind of along the same line because they're all adventure .
sd	when I started thinking about this, those are some of my favorite shows, MCGYVER, because it's only one person there, you know, instead of a cast of people,
sd	but he's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap, and grabbing what he can and, you know, pieces of baling wire and a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider
qy^d	You haven't?
ny	Uh huh.
sd	He's like a semigovernment type agent. Who works for the Phoenix Foundation, supposedly.
sd	He took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder.
sd	So he does all kinds of strange things like that.
qy	Do you like the, news shows, TWENTY TWENTY, SIXTY MINUTES, those kind of things?
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah.
sd	and I usually make time in my day or my week, you know, to watch those.
sd	But, for the most part, I have small kids and I try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time, really when they're up.
sd	I like that real well.
sd	I don't think they have that on anymore.
sd	but they're not making new ones.
sv	But SESAME STREET is still really good.
sd	but they repeat all the old ones.
sd	that one tends to come on earlier in the day than I want to turn the T V on .
sv	the timing of it is good, besides the amo , what's on.
sd^e	I have two little ones.
sd	So they like that.
sd	They come on like from nine to ten and then from, five to six.
sd	They just repeat over again. Which is also,
sd	and they're watching something worthwhile, while I can make dinner and do things I need to do without them under foot.
b	Yeah.
bf	it didn't hurt them any.
sd	The idea, I think that's one of the things I like about STAR TREK.
sv	but the imagination of, look what we can do, you know, in the future, perhaps, this will be possible. That kind of thing.
sd	well, I think we've covered most of my favorite T V shows.
qo	Let's see, how about, MAN FROM UNCLE?
sd	That's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.
sd	I've seen some of them on repeats.
sv	It kind of kept you guessing on, what was going to happen next .
qh	How they're going get out of their latest scrape.
qy^d	every Saturday night?
sd	I'm not old enough to recall that one .
sd	My T V viewing started sort of mid sixties,
sd	they probably didn't have a T V until I got to be, you know, grade school or so.
sd	I, I ended up watching a lot of these things on, you know, repeats in the afternoons or something.
fc	and we'll talk another time perhaps .
sd	I'm calling from Garland, Texas.
aa	Uh huh.
qw	Where are you from?
sd	I didn't know they did it long distance.
fc	Well, it was nice talking to you .
fc	Bye bye.
sd^c	it still echoes.
sd	I love it.
qy	Do you work?
qy^d	And have a family?
sd	well for a dinner party, I think one of my favorite things is baked chicken and white wine.
b	Oh .
sd	I guess mostly out of an international cookbook that I have.
qy^d	They have a T I plant in Texas, in Kingsport?
b	uh huh.
ba	great.
qy	What is a marsala wine a sweeter wine?
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and then you put wine over it.
ba	That sounds real good.
b	Yeah.
qw	What do you serve with it?
qw^r	What do you serve with it?
sd	That's what I do too .
sd	I've got steamed broccoli down on mine .
sd	I've got a good dessert recipe.
qy	do you like angel food cake?
sd	I just break it up in a glass bowl,
 sd	and then I mix up, some cream cheese and a little bit of Amaretta wi , and some cool whip,
sd	and I layer it with, angel food cake and the blueberries and then that topping.
sv	it's great.
b	Uh huh.
sd	We don't eat desserts much any more.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	and pour that over it?
ba	That sounds great.
ba	It would be pretty.
b	Yeah.
sv	That would be pretty.
sd	we've been cooking a lot of, turkey breasts. Because it's low fat.
sd	I toast a piece of whole wheat bread, and then put the turkey on it and then slices of the low fat Swiss cheese
sd	and then I make a little honey mustard dressing and put over it, and pop it in the microwave.
sd	I wouldn't mind serving that to anybody.
aa	No.
sd	it's real quick.
b	Right.
ad	mix up a little, mayonnaise with some dijon mustard, and honey until it just,
sd	I mix it until it just tastes good to me.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	And it keeps in the refrigerator.
sd	it keeps a long time.
sd	it keeps a long time.
sd	And I put a little, yogurt in it too.
sd	It gives it a little tang.
sv	It makes a great sandwich.
b	are you .
sv	that's kind of hard.
qy^d	They'll eat fish?
sd	She'll eat fish.
b	Uh huh.
qy	do you garden or not?
sd	and I put it on a glass plate because it looks real pretty. Sliced tomatoes and then green pepper strips, just over it, and some red onion slices, and just a little bit of, basil, and then a little Italian dressing over it.
sd	and it's delicious.
sd	it isn't.
sd	And you can put some cucumber slices on too.
sd	I got it at the Checkbook Store.
sd	the creative cooking course.
sd	I've never heard of it.
sd	This edition is published by Bonanza Books.
sd	but it was not expensive.
b	Uh huh.
b@	Uh huh. We do too.
aa	Yeah .
sv	I don't think it would.
sd	but it didn't have much beef in it .
b	Uh huh.
sd	it just takes the time to cut everything up.
b	Uh huh .
b	Right.
sd	One of my daughters sent me a COLORADO COOK BOOK, put out by the Junior League of Denver.
qy	Have you ever seen any put out by Junior Leagues?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qy^g	They are usually good aren't they?
qw	what was that? .
b	Uh huh .
qy	You buy the canned baked beans?
b	Uh huh.
ba	that sounds .
ba	That sounds good.
b	Right .
sd^t	and then yesterday I talked with someone from Pennsylvania,
b	Oh.
sd	it just takes a very long time
aa	I know.
sv	This is hilarious .
qw	Well, tell me, what books have you read lately? .
sd	but gee, I just don't have much time for enjoyment reading .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	yeah.
ba	Interesting.
aa	yeah.
sv	That kind of was, kind of a pop psychology time for when a lot of books like that were coming out, I think.
sv	And so that makes real sense, that that's, when it was written.
sd	I was always, just more aware of her jer , you know,
sd*	for her young people, her books. / * one utt?
b	Uh huh.
ba	I'll be darned.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah.
qy^d	I wonder if she's written anything really recently, if she's got anything in print.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
^h	when I was you know, on semester break between spring and summer
sd^e	it wasn't JANE EYRE.
sd^e	it was, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, by Jane Austen.
aa	yes.
sd	but as I say, I was pretty much ashamed that I hadn't read something before then.
b^r	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	how interesting.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	I wouldn't be, surprised,
sd	usually I try to find something long that, I'm going to,
sd	if I have long periods of time, like Christmas vacation, or, you know, when I know I'm not going to be doing anything for a while,
sd	The first issue doesn't come out until next year,
sd	I'm doing some reviews of books, to sort of recommend whether or not a full scale review should be done for the journal,
sd	and I, just got a, I got th , this one,
sd	most of the stuff is on, literary criticism and philosophy, and religion and all that.
sd	and it's a, a biography, that is really interesting,
aa	it really is.
sd	but I think, eventually I'll go back to it.
sd	so it's a brand new book.
b	uh huh.
sd	and this man really shed some light on, some, aspects of Bach's genius and, and, you know, the, more sociological things, you know, like the idea that to be a musician was as much, of a family occupation as anything.
sv	I mean, you know, that was it was families had just loads of musicians .
b	uh huh,
b	Yeah.
sd	not only am I reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed, but also, because the board of advisers for this, journal right now doesn't have a really respected name, who's a scholar on music,
sd	and I'm supposed to decide whether I think this man might be a worthy person to be you know, in that position on the board
sd	but . But at least I, can tell them what I think,
sv	so, it's real interesting.
b^r	yeah.
sd	you know, you see a lot of small colleges doing things, like that,
b	uh huh,
sv	it's really good public relations for small schools,
sd	I think so .
sd	and so } I'm learning the names, if not the actual contents, of a lot of different poems and a lot of French people.
sd	well, where, for instance, a Baudelaire poem that was written, in the French and then has been translated into English by, various people.
sd	And the translations are all so different from one another.
b	Uh huh.
sd	my work, is just kind of compiling, all that for him.
aa	It's real interesting.
qw	And, what part of Virginia,
sd	I've been,
na	Sounds vaguely familiar.
b	okay.
sd	I hadn't been down in that part of the state really.
sd	I wish we did .
b	okay.
qw	Where all you guys go?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh uh.
sd	All these places that I've never been .
sd	my, fiancee's family's from Wisconsin
sd	so I've gone up to Indianapolis on occasion to visit friends
sd	so I usually try to combine it with, catching a couple of games somewhere.
sd	I'm a big Red Sox fan,
bh	you're a Red Sox fan too?
sd	I, you know, go to Cleveland to see them play, the Indians or the Red Sox,
sd	I mean, we do a lot of little trips around here,
sd	We've gone out to, a place in western Pennsylvania called Falling Water.
qy	have you ever heard of it?
sd	and it's, really cool .
sd	the first time we went out there was, the day after hurricane Hugo had come through .
sd	and it was better but not a whole, lot better .
sd	we've gone to Richland, last year and, had a good time, down there.
sd	but I haven't been, down there.
sd	We're going to get down, probably down Norfork sometime this Summer, just to catch a football game actually .
^2	spend a day and a lot of money .
sd	I'm not real interested in Williamsburg because of the price attached, to it.
cc	we'll, do that.
qy^d	so I can wander around without,
qy^d	I just have it pay somebody to get into the buildings?
sd	I think, they do the whole with, you know, paying,
sd	they really did throw away a lot of money getting one thing or another,
sd	but they had a good time
sd	so I went to Disneyland about five times, in one year
sd	and I really have no great urge to go back now.
sd	but the kids in Los Angeles didn't
sd	so we basically had one of the parks.
b	sure.
sd^e	I'd like to, sometime
sd	the fartherest south I've been on the East Coast is Charlotte.
sd	you know, I thought I would go to Florida a couple Summers, ago
sd	but never did it.
sd	and they've gone to, Charleston a couple of times and had a real good, time.
sd	we're getting married in about, a year
sd	and, our honeymoon, we're going up to this, place in Wisconsin called Door County,
sd	It's a place my girlfriend's also wanted, to go,
sd	but there's kind of like a little thing sticking out, in the Lake Michigan,
 sd	that's Door County .
sv	they call it the Cape Cod of the, the Midwest
sv	so, we're thinking that'll be a lot of fun,
sd	she had this, book of pictures from it that were really nice, kind of like a travel guide
sd	so, that should be a lot of fun.
b	Oh.
ba	boy.
ba	that'll be fun .
sv	you won't even, notice it though .
qy^t	is that how you got into this, you know, data base?
sd	I mean most of the people I've talk to are from Texas,
sd(^q)	I go, okay, that the connection, right there .
sd^t	there's been a couple of other the people, most of whom are like me that work in speech labs that are going to use data base, eventually.
sd^t	actually yesterday, I ended up talking to somebody else from the same lab I'm in.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd^t	I haven't had something like that happen, just getting the one guy, from the lab.
sd	my, sister lives on Lake, Norman, just,
sd	and it's, never really works out.
b	Yeah .
sd	just so we haven't been able to take really.
nn	No.
qy	Are you guys, golfers
sv	Except our outside , though.
sd	and I'm know real sure there are,
sd	} I was thinking I might be minor league
b	Yeah.
ar	Buccaneers.
sd	and, I think we may be seeing them this, weekend .
sd^e	I think they're out of town.
sd	that's a nice little town actually, Frederick,
 sd	the Inner Harbor and the, the Aquarium and all that are very nice.
sd	but, it was AWAKENINGS with, Robin Williams and, Peter DeNiro.
qy^d	Have you seen it.
sv	I just have to take my hat off to Peter DeNiro.
sd	but it wears off.
sd	it starts off with like a tic,
sd	The way, you know, you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor.
sd^e	it was very se ,
fe	boy, he is.
sd	but that wasn't it.
qy^g	He wasn't always funny in that show, was he.
sd	That's why I was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part .
b	right.
qw	Well what have you seen?
sd	I saw it.
sd^e	the whole way .
qw^d	Where did you cry.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah.
sd	I cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed .
sd	when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him.
sd	And then the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards, you know .
sd	And that horse has been such a pal to him, when he was alone.
 sv	you can hear my dog .
sv	it really was.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	I thought it was awful, and so graphic,
sv	I think we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo.
sd	Of course they raise them now, you know, to eat.
sd	But we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that.
sd	it wasn't .
 aa	yeah.
b	really.
sd	And to think about how it just changed the whole landscape, you know, you could follow this beaten down path,
sv	and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing.
aa	I know.
qy^d	have you seen any of the behind the scenes, of that movie.
sv	they tried to keep it, you know, as very close to real.
sd	and, they had to teach a wolf how to howl.
sd	That's the, part they had trouble finding was wolves .
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, I think we've made it.
qy	is it five or three.
sd	I'm not either.
aa	me too.
fc^m	Well thank you.
fc	you too.
ad	Go ahead .
qy^d	Well, you should have some opinions on that, then.
sd	Well, I guess if I were going to choose, I mean, my first consideration would be safety.
sd	My second consideration would be, health.
sd	And, I guess my third consideration would be, warm, environment, warm personal environment.
sv	As a matter of fact, I believe that the safety and health, issues, depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children.
sd	but if he's a space cadet and doesn't watch the children, and be aware of what the safety hazards are,
sv	Maybe the right thing to do is to, when a couple has a child, then you say the first four or five years are the most important, and I think I would agree with that, they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting.
sv	Get rid of all these child care centers, at least for young kids below the age of six.
sv	in other words, they probably may end up not working at all in the twenties.
sv	But then they have to work from age thirty or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety.
sv	and so what that means is you don't have to be physically powerful to work.
sv	and I believe that, mental acuity is easy to maintain, if you just simply continue to exercise your mind.
sd	For instance, jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there's, endangerment to their own life and other people's lives.
b	Uh huh.
qo	Well, how do you feel about, companies drug testing prior to hiring?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw^d	Well, what about random testing, though.
qy	Do you feel like that's an invasion of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested?
sd	If it's random, then it's random
sv	and that's not necessarily fair.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and it's not random.
sd	well, I think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season
sd	but it's almost discretionary on the coach's part of each individu , individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem.
sd	and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time.
na	Well, not being a drug user I don't have a problem with that personally
sv	If someone's having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to behave differently
sv	I mean if someone assumed that of me, I would be upset.
sv	and it's and it's based on a perception as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave, normal, you know.
sv	I think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board from the janitors to the executive management.
qw	What type of job do you have?
b	Uh huh.
qy	Well, does your job require you to drive company equipment or to operate any type of machinery that might endanger someone?
b	Uh huh.
sd	the job I have now, requested my, medical record from my old company
 sd	so I don't know if I wasn't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test, because I know that my company does drug testing on occasion.
sv^e	I don't think they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that I didn't, I mean,
sd	They just tested me once.
sd	so it was very important that they make sure their employees, especially linemen were clean.
sd	But I know they test most of the service people fairly regularly just across the board.
sd	it's a rotation.
sd	but again, it depends on what job you're in.
sd	and the men that drive the trucks with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much.
sd	but see, they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what the drug testing schedule is.
^q	and we'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here.
sd	it's made very clear upon hiring.
qy	Well, have we spent our at least five minutes?
bk	Okay.
b	Okay.
fc	Bye bye
ad	Start.
sd	and I think they've got some kind of container for aluminum.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but they're supposed to initiate that sometime in the next couple of months.
sd	so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria.
sd	so, mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea.
sd	not really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's good.
sd	I noticed at the library or someplace this past, month, month and a half ago, they were having a speaker, talk about doing lawn work and, how important it is to cut your lawn without a bag. Just to kind of mulch it, rather than bag it up, because of all the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff,
sd	and it's, I guess a lot more ecological to just mow the grass and let it work it's way back into the soil.
 na	I saw part of that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I wonder about some of the products that they don't take, like some of the plastics and things that they don't take. why they couldn't do more recycling with those.
b	Yeah.
sd	but the cost is like, double or sometimes triple, the regular fertilizers and things you buy.
sv	but the cost is kind of prohibitive.
b	Uh huh.
ba	it's a good idea.
b	Uh huh.
ba	true.
b	Yeah.
sd	I think it's in Canada they're using, recyclable milk jugs, plastic milk jugs, as a reinforcement for roads. For road repairs.
sd	and, they don't expand or contract when the weather changes,
sd	and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing.
b	Huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is, and how important it is to do that.
b	Uh huh.
ba	True.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I've become I guess more of a country fan over the years.
sd	I was born in fifty
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
 b	Uh huh.
sd	it's got, basically an easy, rhythm and tone.
sd	Chicago had some things,
sd	in fact most of my C D s are classical music.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	our generation was, so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness or badness with, things now with the music that's behinds them.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	That's their signal.
b	Yeah.
qw	When did you first take your, first piano lesson?
b	Yeah.
sd	It is a time consumer.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	and turns out I was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to,
sd	you know, I can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if I ever have the time to do that,
sd	but probably not.
aa	No.
fc	Well, it's a pleasure talking with you.
fc	Best, of luck in your graduate school.
qy	Well, what is your view, do you consider the Soviet Union a threat?
b	Sure.
sv	it's hard to know anymore if it's a threat one way or another because, it used to be so, much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell, you know, rank and file in behind it.
sv	And now that with Gorbachev is introducing more, I guess, or expressions of freedom, it doesn't look as though, you know, everybody's following the same pattern.
sv	you never know, well, Gorbachev's future is like whereas, whereas in the past it was seen as, you know, whoever was the head of the communist party was seen as, you know, untouchable.
ba	Exactly.
b	Right.
sv	Well, it's amazing just because of the drain that's been on, you know, both economies that our economy of course, been able to, withstand that a little better,
sd	it's just some ungodly number just to support the military machine.
sv	the U S isn't the threat that we've always made them out to be, you know, even if they're saying that beneath the doors.
sv	But it's hard to thing that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period.
sv	Even if it is, you know, the best thing in the long run, it just steps on too many people's toes, who are comfortable with the way the situation is.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
^2	Expend?
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, it's interesting, anymore the world's getting so small that it doesn't seem to tolerate anymore any kind of the expansionism, philosophy that was here you know, twenty years ago.
sv	So, it's easier for us to say, you know, to an Iraq, you know, you can't do this, get back, you know, or we're going to force you.
sv	Whereas, you know, if the Soviet Union would have, who knows what taking over Mongolia or something like that, will we have been more just rhetoric, rather than going in there officially or, you know, physically and try to remove them.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and I think he's actually, honestly trying to do some change.
sv	But I don't believe that he, in this first pass around, you know, being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	you know, if I'm a Soviet and if part of, you know, south, let's say South Dakota wanted to you know, succeed, am I going to stand for that.
sd	Now I realize that the origins are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with, and that they may have been forced, I'm not that familiar with their future,
sv	it's easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than, a volunteer or willingness to join.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And then, just never given back.
aa	Yep.
sv	the whole idea if you look at the Russian history and I guess all countries the way it used to be is, the only way to truly protect your borders was to have a buffer.
sv	well, I guess like, with, Israel is a perfect example.
sd	but, you know, as you can see with the scuds go right over there.
sv	there's very little that binds you anymore in today's technology.
sv	that's very interesting, never thought of that.
 b	Uh huh.
sv	Nobody knows what to do.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I get confused between which is the Soviet provinces versus which are the Russian provinces, versus what are,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
^2	as a,
b	Sure.
sd	but it's merely an economic now.
aa	exactly.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly
qh	, what are we going to do with all the soldiers over there?
qh	What's going to happen to the economies that are no longer have a million plus people in the indu , you know, in each country from the U S ...
qw	what do you feel is the major change that's been going on?
sv	they no longer feel it's no big deal to stay home and raise your family any more.
sv	and I think, I think that's really sad, because I think there's going to be a generation of kids that are going to grow up raised by somebody else.
sd	and I wouldn't change a minute of it for anything .
sv	But, I can't, I can't help but think that eventually the pendulum's going to swing back the other way again.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah,
ba	it's sad,
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant life style than necessary
sv	I think that they would from the, you know, attention or whatever
sv	and I think it's going to have to swing back the other way, because I think we're going to have an awful lot of kids who are going to have major problems from all this.
b	Uh huh.
qw	what grade do you teach?
qy	Are you out,
sd	we're in Plano here.
qy	but you know, do you ever, do you ever see problems, you know, that you feel you know, that the kids are left alone too much,
qy	He stays at school?
qy	And the school allows that?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my,
b	Uh huh.
^2	No mother to talk to.
qrr	or do you feel there's just going to be a big push you know, for more and more day care type situations?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	drug testing procedures would have to be refined.
sd	From what I've seen on the news , there's a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy, poor procedure in, drug testing.
sd	and, turns out it was a prescription. Or people getting somebody else's blood test.
sd	Same sort of problem that happens sometimes is some of these, like AIDS tests and such.
b	Yeah.
aa	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
sd	I not very long ago worked for Wal Mart
sd	it's not a random
sd	as each employee comes in part of the hiring procedure is a blood test .
sv	but I think the big problem, though, is they send these off to large labs
sd	and then they have thousands and thousands of samples that, going through it in a day and bottles get mixed up, things like that.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd^e	Sam's is part of Wal Mart.
b	Yeah.
ba	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and you have a little taken out of your check each payday to put against, {F uh, stock portfolio. not portfolio, just, you know, against Wal Mart stock.
sd	But, you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while.
sd^t	you're supposed to get five minutes.
qy	you were tested for drugs as as, as you got into T I?
qy	now, were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through
bk	Okay .
b	Yeah.
sd	and they weren't testing any of those who were already working.
 o	Okay.
sd	In Plano.
qw	Where do you live?
bk	okay .
sd	but, it was quite evident that, it was a real brown area
 %	and,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
sd	but they were losing a lot of, trees and a lot of,
na	I guess. from something that the car was giving,
b	Yes,
b	Yeah.
b	Yes.
b	Yes.
sd	I don't know why.
sv	and, oddly enough I thought our part of the country was ideal.
qy^c	Can you hear me?
sd	and we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy
sd	That surprised me because I think, we have a tremendous amount of, sunny days.
sd	but, that was a problem that they were still working on.
b	Yes.
b	Yes.
ba	I hope so .
sv	I mean, you've already mentioned several things, I think, just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there is a problem and more people are interested in,
b	Yes .
sv	Well, and for the future generations, too.
b	Yes.
qw	and how do you hold to yours? .
ba	Well, that's good .
b	Uh huh.
sd	and that was the envelope system. Where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend,
sd	And she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope, what she's buying.
sd	And then at the end of the pay period, if she has any left, that much is for fun or entertainment.
sd	and a seems like the problem that they were having of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we couldn't think about.
sv	You know, the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that weren't supposed to be every month.
sv	It was a hassle .
ba	that's kind of hard .
sd(^q)	You kind of think this is got to str ,
qy^g	you kind of divide it in fourths in a way, don't you?
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	And we're going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next month .
b	Oh.
sd	we're not there yet.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
qy	you know what I'm saying?
sd	I know when we were planning to buy the new car and we hadn't had a car payment in five years, we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for, to see how much was going to be left,
sd	and that was a real eye opener.
sv	It's kind of hard.
bh	Do you?
b	Right.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	and you enjoyed it better probably.
b	Yeah, .
aa	I think so too.
qy^d	So if you're out like in a department store and there's a sale, you're just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you?
sd	and I'm working on it.
sv	And I think though that we need to have some liquid around that you don't have to go through the company to get .
qy	You know?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	My husband said the other day it was the worst mistake we ever did to buy a new car because it wasn't worth it from the day after.
qy	do you think we've been here to in ,
sd	I was waiting so long for it to find somebody.
qw	well, so what is your favorite T V show?
qy	you like that one?
sv	You know, it's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows
sd	and, you know, there's only a few that I like to watch routinely.
sd	so I don't get to watch it very much.
sd^e	that's my favorite.
sd	I guess I like the shows that really have a real sense of, I don't know, honesty or sort of a purity value, I guess.
aa^r	right.
sd	my wife really likes that show,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	like one of my favorite shows used to be HAPPY DAYS
sv	but, you know, Richie always used to be you know, just so honest and pure I guess,
sv	and when he left the show, you know, it seemed to be missing that part of it
sd	and I never did like it after that
sv	There always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere.
ny	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	So you're going to watch a game tonight?
qy	So do you have a favorite for the series or anything?
b	uh huh.
qy	Do you live in the Dallas area?
sd	I'm a big Saint Louis Cardinals fan
sd	you know, they they've come from so far down,
sd	I really would like to see them do well.
sv	maybe they'll make it, I don't know
sd	and her daughter was talking about birth control, you know
sd	and, you know, she's only seven years old,
b	Yeah.
b^r	yeah.
sv	you know, and you can kind of relate to it you know,
sd	I enjoy that a lot
sv	but everybody perceived him that way, and stuff
sv	but as soon as, you know, he went to move in with another girl, the show just died
qw	What did you wear to work today?
qy	So, can you dress pretty casually?
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I, run a business out of my home.
sd	So I tend to get up in the morning, put on, sweats, do whatever I want to do with the kids, then whenever I have a meeting with a client, I'll put a suit on. And then come home and get back into regular clothes again .
b	Yeah.
sd	I've recently, tried to update my wardrobe, trying to put suits together that I can interchange, the, jackets and the blouses and all that a lot.
sd	I can only have a limited wardrobe, since I'm only, working part time right now.
sd	but still, it gives it some variety. Add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that.
qy	Do you like to wear jeans most of the time?
sd	It's nice you can wear shorts, especially on a day like today when it's so hot.
^2	Dress shorts.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
sv	It'll be comfortable.
sd	so my wardrobe has changed quite a bit.
sd	and I have a closet full of sweaters.
qy^d	You live in Virginia, now?
ba	that's interesting.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Today it's eighty eight degrees.
sd	Needless to say, my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while now .
sd	Today was, definitely a shorts day around here.
sd	It's nice to get, out and about.
 sv	Sounds good.
fc	It was nice talking to you.
fc	Bye bye.
o	Okay.
sd	I was trying to get my children quiet for a minute.
sv^t	Well, credit cards, boy, that's an easy topic,
qy^g	isn't it .
sd	I guess I've had some good experience and some bad experience with them.
sd	Well, I do fairly good until I go in the store and I see something I want . You know not need, want.
sv^m	There's a big difference there.
sd	But most of mine that I use is strictly gasoline.
b	Uh huh.
sd	it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything, that way .
sd	At least that's for me.
sd	and kind of knock on wood I haven't yet, not bad.
sd	but , I try to keep it pretty reasonable.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And then they have bad drawbacks, too. I mean high interest,
sd	it's like paying twice.
b	Yes,
b^r	yeah.
sd	but right now, we're just more or less at American Express, you know,
sd	and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in.
b	yeah.
sv	And when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time.
ba	It sure does.
b	Uh huh.
fc	And maybe we'll get to talk again.
fc	bye bye.
qw^d	and I sort of wondered what thoughts you had on that area.
b	Uh huh.
qrr	or are you talking about others?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	how would you achieve that?
qy	So you would trust the decision making economists?
sd	Sometimes called the dismal science.
b	Yes.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I mean right now lobbyists require to register you'd just say, make them all .
qy^d	No causes that you think the lobbyists would be good for?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	Would you be against any deficit spending?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qw	But what practical steps could one take?
qw	and, and how will you, make that actually happen?
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	no, deductions, nothing.
sv	Just ten percent.
aa	Yep.
b	Right.
qr	and is it your expectation that that would raise the total revenues collected or lower them or what?
sd	mostly I do needlepoint, I guess.
sd	well, I've made a lot of baby gifts .
sd	like, especially lately there's been so many babies, bibs and blankets, and things like that. Wall hangings,
nn	No .
sd	A friend of mine gave me a clock kit
sd	and I, kept that because she gave me that.
sd	And it's real neat.
sd	but the minute marks are done, they're like hearts.
sd	I really like doing stuff like that.
qw	what's that?
b	Huh.
 qw	what kind of things did you do?
b	Oh.
b	Yeah,
qw	What did you call that?
sd	I've probably seen it, though,
sd	I use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows.
b	Really .
sd	it is.
sd	They make them hard, you know?
ny	Yeah.
sd	I mean, I would really like to do those
b	yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
sd	That's I think that's what my concern was, was it really sure, and how they would last.
ba	You're right.
sv	That's funny.
b	Yeah .
ba	I know.
sd	so I don't have as much time.
sd	and I have two children also .
sd	but once I get started, I can't put it down.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	I started a project, it's been over a year ago that I swore I was going to finish for somebody for Christmas.
^q	well, I didn't tell you what year .
sd	You know, it's just so hard.
sd	and so since it's counted, you know, it's really a lot of work.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yep.
sd	I'm probably going to hear about it the rest of my life .
sd	It's just hard.
sd	So it's no big deal for me to pick those up and do them.
sd	and I just go with those.
sd	But some things, especially letters, if they suggest certain colors for letters, I just go with whatever I want to.
b^r	yeah.
sd	I made a little, little thumb print and made it a bunny.
sd	I mean, just did a thumb print. You know.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	That was so simple .
sd	It didn't take anything at all.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Robert what substances do you think are the most, likely causes of air pollution?
b	Right.
qy	do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from, industrial areas, factories and so on?
qy^d	and you, so you understand smog .
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
ba	My word.
qy^d	And that was, a few years ago?
qy^d	I wonder if it's any better now. Because California has such strict rules, about emissions and so on.
sd	they were talking about shutting it down, if it didn't comply and so on.
sd	so I don't know.
sd	But they said that it really caused so much smog over, the Grand Canyon in the winter months that they couldn't do the, piloting, you know, the helicopter trips and that sort of thing. Which would be horrible, because there's nothing,
sv	It would be a shame to ruin it.
qw	what do you think individuals could do, or society could do to alleviate this problem.
b	Right.
sv	but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can, force, government, that we elect to deal more seriously with it.
sv	but I do think that, Congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards.
sd	and then we still live with air pollution.
sv	and that's probably how we ought to do it. being individually responsible in order to be group responsible.
b	Right.
sv	and probably the only way that can happen is for, governments to realize that they have to pay if companies don't.
sd	And, I don't know how long that will take.
b	Sure.
aa	right.
b	Right.
sv	now is a wonderful time to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline, so that we don't, run into the kind of problems we recently had
sv	So instead, we spend billions of dollars going to war.
sv	Certainly oil was a big factor.
sv	and I think that's probably going to happen with such things as air pollution, when we get serious about our motors in our automobiles then maybe, you know, we'll have a little bit of help.
qy	do you have any air pollution in your area?
qy^d	Your talking about from the middle states, that have more factories and so on.
sv	I lived in this area for about twenty five years and I think I can tell a difference in the comfort level, particularly in the summer. you know, when it gets hot, and you have, that kind of a pressure from the pockets of air, usually they say caused by exhaust.
sv	So I suspect that it's an ever growing problem.
sv	Well I suspect that we've probably covered everything that we need to here.
fc	It was nice talking to you.
fc	Bye, bye.
qo	what's your feeling about that?
qy	where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both?
sd	No income tax and no sales tax.
sd	and we have what we call the five B s. for our taxes. Booze, butts, cigarettes, beds, hotel room tax bellies, a meal tax and bets, gambling.
sv	but you know, combined with the federal income tax. I think that American's generally do pay too much in taxes
b	Uh huh .
ba	Well that's nice.
sv	nice to get a refund.
qy	Do you think that, for whatever taxes we do pay that, we are getting value for it?
sv	it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion.
bh	You know what I mean?
sv	I should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because, Right because, there's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there's a fly paper effect
sv	and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol, a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it's almost like they will spend as much as they're allowed to collect. You know.
sd	I mean you would take you total salary
sd	and you would just pay a flat tax. No exemptions, no deductions or anything else you know, after you figure up who's in your family.
sv	and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with.
b	Yeah.
sv	but I really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans.
sd	I mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes.
sd	It doesn't seem fair to me.
b	Right.
qy	do you know what your state income tax rate is?
qy^d	Twenty percent?
sd	and she is attending college full time also
bh	you did?
ba	Wow.
bh	really ?
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ba	wow.
b	Okay.
ba	Wow.
 bh	Really?
sv	well, the cases like that, they should,
sv	I mean, if he's going to be drastic, somebody has to be drastic back.
bh	Really?
ba	Wow.
qy^g	no remorse whatsoever,
sv	Well, I guess in cases like you know, where the guy would, obviously, go out and do it again I mean, you've got to do something.
ba	Wow.
ba	You're kidding.
b	Right.
sd	Well, I guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun,
bh	really?
b	Okay.
b	Oh.
ba	Wow.
sd	I guess cases like that, I don't see why they wouldn't bring in the new evidence from the other case.
^2	Of that crime
 b	okay.
qy	Well, they pushing the death penalty?
ba	Wow.
b	Okay.
sv	and I'm really kind of against life in prison anyway because it costs so dog gone much.
sv	I mean, if you're going to put him in prison for life with no chance for parole,
ba	That's true.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I mean, I don't know whether I'd stay in prison or not
ny	Yes, ma'am.
sd	they've had a number of cases here.
sd	well, Jackson, I heard just the other day had their sixty first murder this year.
sd	so that's going up.
sd	I hear of one every now and then.
sd	And I visited the prison up here at Parchman
sd	but they'll let you look down the hall.
sd	and I got to walk in the gas chamber
sd	and it is kind of a weird feeling knowing you're sitting there saying, like, people have died here.
qw	How would you go about organizing a family reunion?
ba	gee.
ba	my.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
bf	With all of you living so close together.
sd	and we met in Florida.
sd	so planning our family reunion was very easy , you know .
b	Okay.
h	Well, I don't know if I know anything or not,
sd	but I've got some opinions on it.
sv	See those type of people that have the most opinions, ones that don't know anything .
 sv	And I think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a far more disadvantaged viewpoint.
sd	I personally know nothing about the Peace Corps though.
qy	Have you ever heard about that one?
bh	really?
qy^d	And this is money that she's borrowed to form her college education?
qy^d	But she got credits for it?
ba	That's very interesting.
b	Huh.
sv	And it's beneficial to the small towns too because, they really have a disadvantage that we wouldn't understand because we're in the Metroplex.
sd	you know, if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist, we could find one it wouldn't be convenient,
sd	but we could find one.
sd	We wouldn't have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that.
qy^g	The Peace Corps itself is really dying out, isn't it?
 sd	It's still in existence.
na	I want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm, dig their own wells, set up, their schools.
ny	Yes.
sv	It's not a program to teach them to use the American money, it's a program to teach them to be more self reliant.
sd	that was his big deal.
sd	but actually they're pretty good, along those lines as compared to what I have seen from other people's children and grandchildren, mine aren't really that bad,
sd	but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good.
aa	No.
sv	They could buy their way out.
sv	and it doesn't do any good.
sd	I, don't know that, if you step back from the current issue and look at it more intellectually, there are forever over, as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out.
sv	You know, we're losing certain, races of people.
sv	There are people now that are obsolete point and fact just like endangered species of animals, so there are quote tribes of people, that are endangered or obsolete.
sd	but they're being winnowed because where they are they're not adapted to their environment essentially.
sd	and one of the quick examples is the Aborigines.
sd	and their belief system and all their structured of theirs, all the structures of their society are gone, essentially.
sv	and that's sad.
sv	and I don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either.
sv	So, I'm wondering if the Peace Corps is, really an effective tool.
sv	there's plenty.
sv	I think we ought to worry about our own species.
sd	but I wonder if there aren't some sociology courses.
sv	That's the last thing you want, to do.
ad	Now come on, let's be realistic,
sv	that's just not realistic.
aa	Right.
sv	I think, that's more realistic than making them go in the Peace Corps.
sv	and again I don't think the Peace Corps is as successful now simply because It doesn't fit the circumstance anymore.
qy	You're in, what Flower Mound?
sd	and the other is the Oklahoma Sooners.
sd	being a native Okie, I like to keep up with what the homeboys are doing.
nn	No.
sd	I got out and got my bachelor's degree in seventy three and, never went to a game there and have never gone to a game since.
 sd	growing up in Oklahoma, there it was always the home team, kind of like Dallas is around here.
sd	And there's always been an interest there.
b	Yeah.
sd	and I was rooting for the Cowboys.
sd	I look for it to be a pretty good year.
sd	At least we hope it will.
sd	but they have always been a really strong team.
sd	Once the pressure gets turned on they seem to loose it.
sd	See that's the typical trait of the Dallas Cowboys. And the Oklahoma Sooners.
 sd	It's funny, over the years.
sd	I don't know why it's so hard to find, a good quarterback these days.
sd	But, the guy winds up getting hurt every other game.
sd	when the pressure is really on when it's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best.
sd	if they figure they have got it won or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or, if something happens that that adrenalin starts flowing. They say, hey, we got to do something now. And then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes.
sd	I guess we're always looking for a good year.
sd	They'll probably get everybody's hopes up and blow it toward the end.
h	I'm not real sure.
sd	and all you can do is get out of the way because here they come.
ba	Well, that's true.
sd	and they are going to come right through you if you don't do something.
aa	yeah.
sd	and for a long time I was pulling for Denver.
sd	sometimes it's too good because he throws too hard.
bh	yeah?
qy	Has it been, snowing up there?
 ba	Wow.
sv	Well, that will make the skiers happy.
fc	Well, good to talk to you.
fc	You guys have a good time, keep those printers coming.
 fc	bye.
^q	what what do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs?
b	Okay.
qrr	or are you so busy you don't have time to do it?
sd	Well being a female and being alone, I don't do anything but put gasoline, in my car, and let someone else check the oil even.
qy	But, have you had any major repairs recently?
b	Oh.
sd	and I'll declare, that's an expensive.
 sd	Maybe I should have just traded the car in.
sd	well, I have a very comfortable car and I have a health problem that I need a large comfortable car.
sv	and I'm sure that any of them would have or charged me almost the same amount.
sd	it hurts, it hurts real bad.
sd^e	I took it to an independent out in Garland.
sd	these people were recommended by a neighbor
 sd	I am not a native of Dallas.
sd	So that means I have to depend on trustworthy friends
sd	and I pray that I get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it.
b	Uh huh.
qw	What work are you in?
b	Oh.
b^r	okay.
nn	No.
sd^e	I have just retired from, the Southwest Medical Center.
sd	but they're all too busy.
sd	and that's find someone and pay them to do it.
sv	but I don't much think so .
ad	so let's make it a good one.
b	Okay.
fc	Thank you.
fc	Bye bye.
qy	or are you familiar with any of that?
b	Huh uh.
sd	And, you know, we separate everything out, and then have to haul it up to a Metco , you know, which is a real pain.
sd	So if they would come up, curbside recycling,
qy	Well, now have they moved them behind Wal Mart?
ba	God.
sd	Because to take it to a Metco , you have to take it when they're open, you know, which is always a real pain.
sd	And we're going, no, there goes our recycling place.
sd	I couldn't even think of what you call them.
sd	Plastic milk cartons, newspapers and cans, and glass, I guess, is really the four things that we do.
ny^r	Yeah.
qy	Is there any place else that really takes anything other than that, that you know of?
b	really.
ba	I know.
sd	but you kind of get, I guess, into a little routine, you know, where it is automatic, now, to throw, different things in different places,
sd	you know, we just kind of dump things in each one, if, you know, if we get them,
sd	If you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag, you know pretty easily,
bh	really.
b	Yeah.
ba	that will be good.
^2	Let somebody get something out of it.
b	Yeah .
qy	you know, do you work for T I?
sd	And they had talked about having a thing like, one Saturday a month, you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home, you know,
sv	Sounds like you have a little one just like I do .
sd	Mine was two in December .
fc	Well, it was good to talk to you.
qy^d	Curbside pick up?
fc	Talk to you later.
qy	do you have either one?
bh	really?
sd	I had rather be outside than inside any day.
qy	Do you work during the week, outside the home?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
sv	Or you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight.
sd	in fact, I was prevented no, about thirty years ago with a life membership, from the Richmond, Virginia counsel of garden clubs.
sd	but I still have,
sd	well, it's always something that seems so odd to me
sv	it has really nothing to do with, actual gardening or flower arranging or anything like that,
sd	it was just that I happened to organize this group, that was about seventy people.
b	yeah,
sv	those numbers were great
b	Yes.
sd	Just moved to North Carolina,
sd	in Oklahoma, it's the men's garden clubs that I would have wanted to join.
sd	And you would have because they do all kinds of, gardening and not just flowers like women do.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I think so too.
sd	and I have spent the last ten years being a florist.
sd	Being a florist.
sd	it was exhilarating, for many years.
sd	many of those tanned until the last couple when, we had such an economic slowdown.
ad	well, tell me what's in your garden this year, since I don't have one.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you have trouble with red spider on marigolds?
b^r	uh huh.
sd	so is my favorite.
b	Okay.
b	Yeah.
sd	well, I think it has the best flavor.
sd	well, I like them in between.
sd	I like them in between.
sd	The flavor is better I think in between.
b	yeah.
sd	My mother,
sd	But I think, that's like another vegetable.
sd	I love them that way just the thrill of,
sd	In fact, my mother, who is eighty six years old, canned over a hundred quarts of half runners last year.
b^r	yes.
 b	yes.
qy	And she tends to it herself?
ba	isn't that wonderful.
b	Yeah.
 b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No.
ba	Wonderful.
sv	Bet you showed them.
b	Oh.
ny	No.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm enjoying hearing you so much .
sd^e	October.
sd^e	recently seven months
sd	I love it.
sd	you know, rains a little too often.
sd	I have a little spinach .
 fc	Bye bye.
qo	So, what do you think about it?
b	Right.
sd	Well, there is always the possibility, even remote as it is, of mistaken, of,
b	Yeah.
sd	I'm a, I mean, I'm, I'm very much for drug testing,
cc	I mean, I'm going to take the negative side just for a second, just to do it.
sd	see, I have to take, medication for, for kidney transplant.
sd	And I'm going to be taking that the rest of my life.
sd	I don't know how that's going to affect,
b	Right.
sd	I work for Texas Instruments
sd	and they send me and have me, you know, go through this, thing, you know,
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and this is why.
sd	but you know, we are in a war against, drugs.
sv	I mean it's horrible.
sv	I mean, you don't know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not,
sv	And I think, personally, the drastic step has to be that you can't work if you continue taking drugs.
sv	I mean, make it so, Well, make it, ma , not necessarily difficult,
sv	but make it so that it's not glamorous.
sv	or at least it seems that way.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
qw^t	What limits ought to be put on it, do you think?
b	Uh huh.
^2	Treatment before for dismissal type thing.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Personally, I think that's what I was about to say is that everyone needs to be tested.
^2	That it could happen.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want.
aa	So I've got to agree with that.
sv	I think we did pretty good.
b	All right.
fc^m	it was nice talking to you, too.
sv	since there's so many issues, this one person can believe a lot of different ways on, all of them
sv	so, it would be really difficult to have that one perfect person that believed exactly what you believed.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah,
ba	that's good.
sv	it would be the other way that the Republicans were real liberal minded as far as like, moral standings and those kinds of things.
b	Uh huh .
ny	Yeah .
sv	I think in, the Texas governor elections, I think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody, this time.
bh	really?
b	Right.
sd	that's true that the different places in America that, you know, different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place.
b	Uh huh .
sv	and then once they do get elected, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised, you know, beforehand.
sv	with the economy going the way it is and everything, that was nearly ridiculous thing to, even try to do.
^2	after the war.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you hear the dogs in the background here?
sd	and they went off.
sv	and, that was sort of interesting.
qw	What part of the country are you from?
bh	Are you really?
sd	this is Dallas where I'm at.
sd	The outskirts of Dallas.
qy	do you work for T I in any way?
qw	how did they get you?
b	Oh.
sd	and I thought, wow, that might be interesting.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd^t	Central Standard Time is what they're doing it by.
sd^t	so maybe I'll figure it out.
sv^t	and, that was an interesting topic.
sd	I'm Kyle Hunt, too, if you ever come to Dallas area.
sd	We live right by the airport.
b	okay.
b	Yeah.
fc	Okay.
sd	and, the family car is a Dodge Caravan. because we have three kids and they're under thirteen
sd	I have one of those, pickups with the, seat with a seat in the back.
sd	When they get to be teenagers with long legs, it may not work.
sd	and, and since I do a lot of projects, I throw things in the back
sd	and I kind of like having a pickup truck.
sd	Actually, I think of it , as a car that'll last .
sd	So, I'm pretty happy.
sd	so I wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck.
sd	I'll let somebody else, have the showroom shine
sd	and I'll pay for the rest of it.
sd	I'm not sure.
sd	but, I guess, we had a small Toyota wagon
 sd	and we were real happy with that because, my second requirement after price is, low maintenance.
sd	We didn't do much to it at all.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Uh oh.
qw	at how at how many miles?
b	Huh.
qy^d	You didn't overheat it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I don't think it's much of a sport for him. I guess,
b	yeah.
aa	No .
 b	Yeah .
b	Right.
sd	If I only had some place that I could store the, camper top, I would have it off most of the time.
sd	I really leave it on there just just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty.
sv	trucks are built, I mean,
sv	They're the only things Americans still know how to build
b	Yeah.
sd	so, mine's a Ford .
b	yes.
b	Yeah.
sv	that's a serious truck.
sd	I know a contractor who just got one of those.
qo	So. How's your products been?
qy	Have you had any lately go out?
ba	wow.
qy	even, all the warranties were out?
ba	You're kidding.
sd	so we had to buy all those, too.
sd	I buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail
sd	But, that's about the only thing I've had gone wrong.
ba	That's incredible.
qy^d	And they all went out at the same time?
ba	Wow.
sd	it's frustrating.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	they go out a lot?
sd	and make, automotive air bags, the safety air bags.
ny	Yeah.
sd	and so our testing is pretty thorough,
sd	I think they test four or five a day, actually exploding the air bags
sd	and then we do electrical tests on them during the process,
b	Yeah.
sd	it's incredible how much testing they have to do.
b	Uh huh.
sd^t	so we're going to talk about, what kind of clothes we wear while we work.
qy	Do you work for T I?
sd	I stay home also.
sd^e	I have two, a seven year old and three and a half year old.
qo	How about you?
b	Oh.
ba	my, you are busy
sd	so, all girls around here .
sv^e	really sweet.
aa	That's how I am too.
ba	that's funny.
b	Yeah.
sd	and when it's cold, I'm wearing sweat pants, and most of, unless I'm going to something special that my daughter's doing, or something like that,
sd	and now nothing seems to be comfortable because I bulge in all the wrong places,
b	Yeah.
aa	yeah.
sd	I know what you mean.
sd	and I remember, I wore sundresses and, you know, just those real cool dresses almost the entire time .
sd	And I had one that was born in December,
sd	course I'm always hot when I'm pregnant, too,
sd	but I really have been spoiled by sweat pants and these new, units outfits, you know, that are just knit,
sd	they are so comfortable.
sd	it's just, you know, a light weight kind of like a sweat suit but made out of that real light polyester stuff,
sd	and it's just great because you know, you can decorate them up, or dress them up, if you want,
sd	and I've enjoyed wearing those
sd	if we had professional jobs where we go into an office and have to wear a jacket or something that would make a big difference.
sd	I worked part time when my oldest was a baby
sd	and and it was a little bit hard to, wind down,
sd	and I would be burning up, like in the summer time
sd	by the time I got home I was like, I've got to get out of these clothes .
aa	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	and then when you drive home, like especially if you're in a lot of traffic which you are in Dallas,
b	uh huh
sd	because I always hated to run my air conditioner just sitting still all the time
sd	I was afraid I'd make the car overheat.
sd	it was still a hundred degrees
sd	and I had a friend who used to take shorts to work,
sd	and after work she'd go in the bathroom and change her clothes
sd(^q)	and I thought, that's probably a good idea because you really
sv	because you can ruin your good clothes getting so hot in them especially if it's something that has to be dry cleaned, which I don't have any of.
sd	even when I go to church I have to have something I can just throw in the washer when I'm through.
aa	I know it.
aa	Me, too.
sd	that's how I am, too,
 qw	How do you keep up with current events?
qw	what what channel do you watch or what station?
sd	so I really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff
sd	so I get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which really isn't too great sometimes .
sd	The stations I listen to are just mainly music.
qy	I mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized
sd	they mainly go with like popular topics just not like basic news.
 b	Yeah.
sv	looks like they're going more for ratings than for you know actual news.
sv	I think, you know probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers
sd	I am from a small town too here in Texas that like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato
sd	or who killed who.
sd	and the story was,
sd	And the news covered it right, you know, hours after it happened
sd	and they were taping people who were crying who had everything
sd	and then like three days later this, local news station was using as as their promo to promote themselves.
sv	I just thought that's kind of cold,
sd	they were showing like these dead people
sd	and they were showing people crying
sv	I mean just taking advantage of you know.
sv	I mean, somewhere it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in Walter Cronkite that if you know
sv	and everything.
b	Yeah.
qo	What did you think of the coverage of the war?
bh	Did you?
b	Yeah.
sv	and it never really showed what actually the damage that really happened that's
sv	a lot of times like the news coverage showed all you know, the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties
qh	if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who you know got really hurt and everything.
ad	Go ahead.
sv	but I think just the instability of the country right now is, sort of scary.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I guess that's what concerns me the most. Is they're so unstable that somebody like that could make, decisions that would jeopardize a lot of people.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it looks like it's come close to that as it is.
ny	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	I haven't.
b	Uh huh.
qy	You mean in the most recent conflict?
sv	It's bad enough that the Soviets do it.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's scary to know that they're supplying that many people with weapons. Especially when it's to the south of us.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think Gorbachev has about had his day.
 b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I sure wouldn't turn my back on them.
b	Uh huh.
co	let me try it again because usually ,
ny	Yeah.
sv^t	Well, I think we're on, maybe.
sd^t	I guess we'll find out .
qy	So, in Maryland are you a Skins fan?
b	Yeah.
bf	So, you were out there in San Francisco?
bh	yeah?
sd	it's, other than the big catch, with the Forty niners and the Cowboys back a few year ago I like San Francisco.
sd	I never really was a Cowboys fan until I moved down to Texas.
ny	Yeah.
qy^d	and, I guess when you're down here in Dallas you finally get indoctrinated into the Cowboys because, you know this is a big football territory down here.
sv	And, unfortunately, of course, the Cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years.
sv	but, it's not like it used to be.
sd	But I think, actually, in trying to follow, you know the Cowboys over the years I think, they used to have a philosophy for, well I don't know, probably the last twenty five years except for about the last about five or six years they always went out and tried to draft the best, athletes. And didn't really put them draft for any particular spot.
sd	But they would go out and try to go for, the best people and then mold them into different areas or find their natural niche.
sd	and this is when Schramm was still there.
sd	and when they drafted somebody and he didn't workout at that spot it really wasn't a good enough athlete to move to any place else.
sv	I think the decline of the Cowboys as a powerhouse really kind of started with, not drafting the best athletes.
b^r	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	they still have some, some draft picks, that they got,
sd	I think it was, Minnesota's ,
b	Yeah.
aa	yeah .
sd	I've got a friend that, lives right next to the Cowboys' training camp.
sd	and they're all thinking that, man, they, they really got something going this year,
sv	{D You, know, } I guess it's the same way with baseball or anybody, you know,
sv	Spring training until you actually start going out and getting out against the competition everything probably looks pretty good.
b	really.
sd^e	they did. As a matter of fact,
ny	Yeah.
qy^d	Well, you don't like the Skins?
bk	okay.
ba	Jeez.
sd	of course, then you're not that far from Philadelphia.
sd	it was Buddy Ryan, the one that I can't, stand too much.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	actually, you said you lived near, Baltimore?
sd	and, actually I used to drive a lot between Baltimore and Washington
nn	no.
b	okay.
sd	I used to go out of B W I a lot.
qy^d	yeah?
qy	Is it the, the Wharf or the, Inner Harbor.
b	Yeah.
b	Great.
aa	 Yeah.
sd	the Colts you know, still to me are the Baltimore Colts.
qy	You know?
b	okay.
qy^d	Delaware?
sd	there's not a whole lot in Delaware.
qy^d@	I take it you're an east coast type guy?
o	Okay.
ny	Yes,
sd	Some of the older people organized it.
sd	and it was like, when our ancestors first came over.
sd	And, then what they did was they asked every family to write something about their family. like, how many kids you had, and who you had married,
sd	and it showed well, who my husband's parents were, you know. And, who he married and then how many children we had and then like his brothers and sisters
sd	and it went through the whole family and stuff.
sd	And, it was so good.
sd	you know, plus it's got a lot more people interested in it because, you got to participate sort of.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And, everybody got a book, that came to the reunion.
sd	And, it told like, you know, where the first Connally's came over,
sd	and it just kept coming on up through the generations.
sd	So, that was really neat.
na	Well, he does .
sd	But, he has enough relatives to make up for me not having any .
b	Uh huh.
 sd	because a lot of them lived in like a group, you know, down one highway.
sd	and they all lived down there by it.
sd	and this is where my aunt lives and my uncle,
sd	Nobody has this many relatives, you know .
sd	but, they really were all there.
sd	And, another thing that's really good about, family reunions, is having everybody just cook whatever is their specialty, and bring it. because nobody it seemed liked the same thing.
sd	and then you got to taste a lot of new dishes and stuff too, and get a lot of good recipes.
sd(^q)	Where if you said a certain thing and say, okay, we're all going to have fried fish, or, we're all going, to have fried chicken.
 sd	Everybody might not like that.
ny	Yeah,
sd	they came from all over.
sd	they just stayed with different ones of them.
 sd	and then, they had it.
sd	It had gotten so big that they had it at the church.
sd	you know, and then they had, then they ate out on the ground.
ny	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
b^m	Uh huh.
qy	But, you know what you can do?
qy^d	A lot of these lakes and things, if you could find a centrally located, like, say about the same distance for all of you all to come?
sd	and it, you know, like on a lake,
sd	I mean, you know,
 +	it's got little rooms that separate off of it and stuff,
sd	and, it's not very expensive that way.
sd	It's like a, they have like a, a convention type thing.
sd	And, then it has little rooms off of it where,
 sd	But, then it has like a kitchenette and things like that
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	what you can do is, you can write different places, the Chamber of Commerce, tell them what you're interested in.
sd	Ask them what they have, you know, at area lakes and all.
 sd	because now every time we plan anything, just about, we write to the Chamber of Commerce of where we're going because, you can find out so much easier, that way, than try to locate it, you know,
sd	calling different places can really run you up a bill.
sd	I mean, you can't get it exact, you know, usually,
sd	And that is not bad at all.
sd	But, lot of times they'll have like, little cabins,
sd	and three or four or five families can stay in those cabins because they have, you know, just the single bunk beds and stuff.
sd	that doesn't cost you as much.
sd	But, you know, that's the best way I found, something where you go and,
sd	but it wasn't any of my immediate family anyway. Because I didn't have any of them left.
sd	But, , they had, thing where everybody could come and meet and go out to eat.
 sd	But, I didn't think that was as good. Because, it was like, you know, you couldn't really talk and stuff, like you could when, you were at the lake, or somewhere, you know, where you were out.
sd	This was like everybody came into town and went to this restaurant.
sd	I didn't like that much.
nn	No.
no	What they did was, Well, see what they did was, okay, they wrote to all the initial people, you know, the oldest ones.
sd	then those in turn got a hold of these other ones.
sd	I think there was four or five different people, that would call, you know, some of them, if they didn't have their addresses and all on them,
sd	and, you know, they told them that what we had to do was when we sent back in our information, we had to tell them how many people were going to be coming, you know.
sd	And then, when they talked to us or when they sent us the letter, you know, to get the information and all, it asked, you know, will you be willing to bring
sd	and you had to check off what all you would be willing to bring.
sd	that's the reason it ended up in a church because, I mean, there was just so many of them.
sd	But, it turned out so much better like that. Because they knew ahead of time how many people to expect.
sd	Now if there was a sickness or something like that, I mean, you know, you're not going to lose that many.
b	Right.
b	Okay well,
sd	if you wanted them both to come, then you would have put that down on the list
sd	and you would have been the one that sent their invitation to them, and ask for their information.
sd	To send back to those other people.
sd	Because once it went to the oldest people then they knew who they wanted to invite,
sd	then, they sent their little things to us.
sd	it was up to me, you know, whether I wanted my kids and, you know, any of my family to come.
 %	So,
sd	like if I didn't want somebody to come, then I just wouldn't send them one of the questionnaires.
sd	So there really wasn't a problem that way.
 %	Well,
sd	but, I tell you what, that's the neatest book we've got,
sd	and they charged us, I think like, it was like five or six dollars, I can't remember exactly, you know, that we paid for the book to be printed.
sd	and it's not a hard back book, it's just like a, you know, folder type thing.
sd	you know, it has everybody that you could ever imagine, and some you couldn't .
sd	and, it will be something my kids will have, you know.
sd	but I know very little about before my grandparents.
sd	I mean, very little about it.
b	Yeah.
sv	Maybe what you could do if you couldn't get into a full family reunion, and you wanted to go back some,
sd	but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents, then you know, you can find somebody else that can tell you something else about these,
sd	They don't, encompass, many handcrafts like knitting and that kind of thing.
sd	I go to estate sales, which takes up a lot of time.
qo	Now, what do you mostly do ?
ba	boy .
ba	That should be fun.
qw	How old are they?
sv	Well, I think that's better than having that party at home .
b	Yeah.
sd	And, the the, the skating rink does the rest practically, I guess.
ba	Boy, what a help that is.
sd	Well, not that long.
sd	We moved here from Enid, Oklahoma.
sd	So, we're originally from Virginia, this part of the country.
sd	But, we did spend twenty years in Norman and Enid and loved it.
sd	But, we needed to get back, to our older parents.
sd	The weather is divine.
ny	Yes.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Well, my husband was with, University of Oklahoma and, Phillips University in Enid.
sd	And then he went with, a family corporation that has oil and ranching and varied enterprises.
sd	And, he just quit a perfectly good job and we came East .
ny	Yes.
sd	He's doing, quite a bit of consulting work and, has been offered a permanent position
sd	he's liking this free time actually .
sd	It's just wonderful after all, these years of working.
sd^t	a gal who works, with T I on this project .
sd	mother is my best friend , in Virginia .
sd^t	So , we have spread the word a little bit in this part of the country.
bh	Really?
qw	what is her name?
sd^t	I haven't, I haven't talked to a Tina yet .
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
ad	Well, you haven't told me, what sports that you are active in.
b	Yes.
ba	Well, I think that's, easy entertainment for a, family, too.
^2	Under the, bleachers.
qy^g	Well, it's getting, a little hot, isn't it?
sv	Or maybe this evening anyway.
aa	Very, much so.
b	Yeah.
sd	it doesn't.
sd	It's, directly across the state from Tulsa.
sd	Well, Enid is, not, an unknown little city.
sd	And it, was, a very, self sufficient, wealthy , town, for a long time, anyway . You know , until, everything happened,
sd	the bottom fell out.
sd	But, there's a lot of, old time wealth there that, has helped to stabilize things.
sd^e	Something like that.
b	Oh.
sd	Well it's , pretty.
sd	we had so many wonderful days.
qy	Isn't it, funny how, your standards change ?
b	Yes.
ba	Sure.
sd@	Carolina, this part, is very much like that, too. Very, * two utts? foggy and, misty.
sd	The moss grows, on the trees in the woods up , eight, ten, feet.
sd(^q)	And some people said to me, "Well, that's our wintertime." need to go.
fc	And I've enjoyed talking to you.
fc	Thanks so much.
fc	And I hope you enjoy, and get through that birthday party.
fc	I do, too .
fc	Bye bye.
sd	generally I get, you know, most of my news, in the, you know, weekly magazines like TIME, NEWSWEEK and, U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. with occasional smatterings of, you know, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and, of course, the local paper.
sd	So that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines.
sv^e	I, well, I, I don't think I have the time to really become a student in every article.
sd	and so I, I like the weekly magazines, because it gives me, you know, the high points of what's going on.
sd	But here I am, you know, cheek by jowl with our nation's capital
sv	But, it turns out that, that the C N N I think, is great. And for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events
sv	and I don't really, you know, I don't really feel as though I've a gotten sufficient, you know, dose of news that way.
b	Yes.
sv	Well the MERCURY and the, and the CHRONICLE are the only things that are really, can stand up there.
sd	I use to work at Anteks.
sd	Anteks, Amdahl and places like that.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but really, th , on the public T V, you know, MACNEIL LEHRER is an hour's program that I always,
sd	if I watch any news program, it will be MACNEIL LEHRER. and occasionally C SPAN.
sd	and and, and also, they have the, PARLIAMENT'S QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD.
o@	And then, * needs slash mark Yeah.
sd	Here's this dude in a wig
sd(^q)	and I said it's Parliament .
sd	this is how I discovered, you know, the Prime Minister's, you know, question and answer period, you know.
o	Okay.
ny	yes.
sd	It seems like, even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable, that are sort of like a chain, if I can use that word still you have to deal with the people that, you know, happen to be operating it locally
sd	so it's difficult for them.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b^r	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
ba	I'm sure that's true.
sd	So, I can see where someone, you know, in a position like that, in a live in capacity, would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the financial to be able to do that.
b	Yeah.
sd	but you still have to be realistic, as well, I think.
b	Yeah.
sd	so it's, such a responsibility.
b	Huh uh.
sv	Most of the time .
b^r	Sure.
sv	it's just a scary thing.
ba	That's a big plus .
 b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I'm sure that's a whole new ball game.
sv	since they're both in school, you don't have to worry about a full time person to take care of them.
sv	That's something altogether different,
b	Huh uh.
ba	of course not.
aa	No.
aa^r	No.
ba	I'm sure.
b^r	Right.
b^r	Right.
b	Huh uh.
sv	I guess you find out that you're a much stronger person than you thought, maybe.
b	Huh uh.
sv	Now it's just a reservoir that you tend to regularly, I'm sure.
qy	do you feel comfortable, with them coming home after school until you and your wife get home
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
sv	That's just a difference in kids, I suppose.
b	Yeah.
qy	is it the one that needs more supervision that has a bad influence on the older or more mature one?
sv	How unfortunate .
sd	But I do hear my friends talk about it.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah .
sd	You know, I think about, wouldn't it be nice,
sd	If you could just, have a whole bunch .
sd	By the time the youngest ones are there, you'll have older one to take care of them.
sv	It really is.
b^r	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
qy	do you subscribe to magazines yourself?
 sd	Of course, anything that appeals to the homemaker since that's my main line of interest.
sd	And then once in a while I'll pick up a WORKING WOMAN or something and realize why I don't want to go back to work . What I enjoy about staying home.
qy^d	And then you stopped them all.
sd	I find that, about two years is probably my max on subscribing to one in particular
sd	and then I kind of get turned off by it. Other than GOOD HOUSEKEEPING.
sd	GOOD HOUSEKEEPING is the one that kind of sets around for when I'm really have time and I really want to read something, you know.
sd	I don't get into books too often because I have so many things that I stay occupied with on a general basis,
sd	so I enjoy reading parts on travel in the various you know, different ones.
sd	I'm, read it fast and put it down .
 b	Right.
 sv	and you think, where did I ever put that recipe.
sd	But, that's mainly my, whole idea on
sd	no matter what it is, air travel or anything and I,
 b	Right,
sd	and it was just above my head without having someone there to give me the advice as I went along.
 %	but, Okay?
ad	All right, I guess we might as well end our conversation at this point.
qw	how long have they been recycling there in Virginia? .
aa	uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
fp	Hello.
bd	you're okay,
o	okay .
qy	have you recycled plastic also?
sd	we have out here up until just this last year in on you are town there wasn't any really good way,
sd*	they had some bends, * sp: bins around that we could find and put them in
sd	it wasn't very well advertised
sd	but recently, the refuse department has, is working on getting a system going where we will actually have, a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things
sd	so it should be good,
sv	I think it's a marvelous idea when I just think of the papers that I dump out
sd	I just hate to think about it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I guess one of the things, I think, that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about, about it,
sv	there's needs to be more public, service programs or something that would let us know had happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening
sd	I've seen a few things but not very much, really
sv	I'd like to know, for instance, when they say, plastic, all plastic, what kind of plastic, can you put all together or, is there some reason not to,
sd	I don't know
sd	but I'd be glad to organize it, if they'd tell me what it is I'm doing because that would be really helpful. / * sep. utt? because as D ?
b	Uh huh.
sv	Now that gives, you a little bit of incentive there.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Saving them for you,
sv	I think helping us be more enthusiastic about it, helping us maybe using the money for something special that would be like paying off the national debt .
sv	I think there needs to be a little bit more in the area of, advertisement, and public letting you understand, more of what it is you're doing, why you're doing it, how it's done and, what happens to it because I think that would help a lot.
b	Yeah.
sd	I'm glad, to see some of these things, I think.
sv	People are becoming more conscience all the time that it's necessary to do, and that we need to somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped,
sd	I'm that's about my, , some on recycling
fc	but I enjoyed talking to you.
fc	bye now.
qy^d	and your occupation is teaching?
b^m	Substitute teacher.
sd^e	it is.
ad	Well, I was just trying to make an introduction, here .
sd	and, and I haven't told you I'm going to be at a different school this year, now.
sd	I've just gotten another job at an elementary library at Barron.
sd	So I'll probably be wearing slacks as often as I do because I'm, if I'm going to be down on the floor messing with them, I'm not going to wear nylons and, you know nice nylons and dresses.
sv	Well, of course, you've been at Clark enough that you know it's always cold .
qy^d	But, you don't know, I guess at some of the other schools you go to unless you've been there.
b	Right.
sd	she just didn't like sloppy dressing.
sd	and in the winter, you know, I maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than I do in the summer. And add a heavier jacket or, you know, wear jackets more in the winter than I do in the summer.
sd	I don't really work in a profession that requires that I wear a business suit and, you know, look really,
b	Yeah .
 b	Right.
qy^g	And you never know that, though sometimes when you're going in, do you?
b^r	right.
^2	On what, Thursday.
sd	so you're aware ahead of time of what's going on.
sd	and, because some of the teachers I know wear, dress up jeans, not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease
sv	But, if you're going to tell the kids they have to dress up, I guess you can tell the teachers that, too.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
 b^r	right.
sd	there's a couple teachers up there that do dress up more than others.
b	Right.
sd	or, there's, There's usually, yeah, there's usually something going on that, would, cause that to happen
sv	some of those male coaches, that might really,
sd	I mean we've got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period
sd	Well, see, that's what I would think.
sd	That's what I would think.
sd	Course, we had one coach, one period he'd teach P E and the next period Health and then a period of P E
sv	and that's hard.
sd	I guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top
b	You don't think so.
sd	and it's not at some of the private schools,
sd	but even there's a couple public schools in Dallas where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers, you know, dress in accordance with that.
sv	I mean it's a lot of trouble to take care of that.
 %	and,
 sv	And then the girls,
b	Right.
sv	not in Plano.
sd	but they said in the Dallas schools that that helps their educational process there.
sd	Highland Park's thinking about going that route.
sv	and then I think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do.
qy	Do you manage the money?
qy	Are you married?
bf	You are.
sd	My husband always says he earns it, and I have to spend only what he earns .
sd	and he always threatens that when I spend more than, what's coming in, I have to go back to work
sd	so I manage it .
qy	Now, do you actually follow a budget?
sd	and so I really don't have the obligations there any more that we have to balance to you know, get things together for them,
sd	and I try to keep my MasterCards and things paid currently
sd	and I put things on there that I think I'm not going to get to
sd	but for the most part, our mortgage and our utilities at this point, we're in a new home, and, they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to
sd	but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we're going to pay for it ahead
qy	do you get into car,
sd	and I said look, you guys are all into car payments,
sd	and it has eighty two thousand miles on it
sd	Believe it or not, we did, we found one, one newer
sd	the worst part is, it's the same color
sd	and I said, you know how when you have a bad one, you say, never again
sd	I said, well, we had one, and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it
sd	and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on.
sd	and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years, or next year probably.
sd	and it depends, because I don't like to sell what we're trading in to an individual unless we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell
^q	You're going to get one shot at us
qo	So, Mike, what are your opinions on, trial by jury?
bf	but leave it up to the more experienced person who knows how it fits into the, kind of the rate for different .
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
qy	Do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm, a dollar figure for losing different body parts?
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
ba	That's true.
b	Huh.
bf	As opposed to the insurance paying the bills,
b	Uh huh.
qw	or how does that work?
bf	your talking about corpor ,
b	Sure.
b	Okay.
sv	But in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance, if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Okay.
qw	so, how do you think we've changed in the last ten to twenty years?
b	Uh huh.
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qw^d	where'd you live at,
sd	I'm from , Illinois,
qw	how long you been in Dallas?
bh	really?
sv	you know, as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job to do.
sd	I agree.
sv	to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values.
b	Yeah.
sd	I think there's more pressure like on both parents to work, and things like that than there used to be
sv	that's one thing I see a lot more, you know, double income families and a lot more like baby sitters raising the kids and things like that, I guess.
ba	that's for sure.
ba	that's right.
b	Yeah
sv	the ways our tax laws and stuff are structured, you can't ever catch a break until you can get into a house in a lot of ways,
^h	so, I'm trying to think of anything else that's changed over the last ten or twenty years.
aa	I agree.
sd	but I don't know at what point,
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
bh	Do you?
qw	What, department do you work in?
sd	I'm in semiconductor division too.
qw	So. How long you been with them, since you moved down here?
sd	I'm over at the Center One building.
qw	What floor?
qy^d	second floor, you work with, linear.
qy	Do you, do you know Alec Morton?
sd	so I'm pretty familiar with,
sd	His reputation precedes him.
b	Yeah,
sv	I guess if this is the only place you've lived, Lubbock is a lot different than Dallas.
sd	I mean, here in Dallas everything is just real rush, rush.
qy	Is there a DeVry in Akron?
bk	Oh,
sv	Sounds like you haven't been back there in a while.
qy^d	You still have relatives back there
b	Oh.
qw^t	how long are we supposed to talk here?
sd	well my kids are probably needing me to go
fc	well, it's nice talking to you.
fc	Talk to you later.
qo	Well, Stephanie, what's your position on gun control?
b	Uh huh.
qr	Now was that just on handguns or was that on rifles?
bh	Really?
qy	And that didn't help at all?
sv	I guess I would tend myself to be more towards the, like three, where I don't think you should necessarily ban guns by any means,
sv	you know, you shouldn't be able to go out there and just buy one you know, right off the shelf.
sv	And, so, I think that kind of control would be good,
sv	and they thwarted the robbery attempt.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	did you, were you brought up in a family that hunted
ba	How about that.
b	Uh huh.
ba	jeez.
b	Uh huh.
sd	you couldn't be inconspicuous, when you walked into a store stuff like that,
sd	Now of course, you know, in this world anytime you've freedom you can be able to get anything you want.
sd	like today they just introduced what's called the Brady bill. The seven day mandatory waiting period, on getting any guns.
sv	And I think that, Shoot that's a good idea.
ba	sure.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's crazy .
fc	Good bye.
 o	you've done.
qo	Well, how did it go?
ba	Gee, like starting over, I guess.
b	Uh huh .
sv	once you get it done, then you probably won't have that problem again.
qy^d	you've got an older house?
sv	They are built a little bit more sturdy than ,
b	Right.
ba	is that right.
b	Yes.
^2	And just start at square one.
sv	Well, and then if you do it wrong .
^2	Everything went all right.
sv	That's the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that happens.
b	Right.
bf	All worked out all right,
sd	well probably the last thing I did was, paint and wallpaper kids room
sd	This must have not been a very good quality, because it just hasn't stood up very well.
sd	it was flat
sd	but they say you ought to use your gloss mainly in your kitchens, and things like that.
sv	I don't know if it was just the.
sd	you know, so you're supposed to be able to wash it
sd	I don't know how else to explain it.
sd	It's pink.
sd	just didn't turn out quite as nice as I would have liked
sd	but I think it only took one, can.
nn	No.
sd	and then } they add the color.
qy^d	You know what I'm saying
sd	And then I wall papered a couple of walls,
sd	Well, that was the first time I've ever wallpapered,
no	That's an education in itself.
sd	first of all it takes quite a few rolls, even a small room, if you're trying to match a design.
sd	I got a Mickey Mouse print is what I got.
sd	And so a lot is wasted.
sd	See, I didn't even think to look for that.
sd	one of them was just a different color pink, is what it ended up being.
sd^e	I didn't.
sd	then you had to cut around the closet and cut around a window
fp	good morning.
qy	Do you have recycling in Sachse?
bh	really?
qy^d	And it's twice a week?
sd	Apparently the trucks that they had, lined up, they needed the parts for, Saudi Arabia .
qy	But, do you recycle?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's great.
sd	My daughter was going, to Camp Goddard, which is through the Plano school system, you know in the fall couple of years ago
sd	and from there we now recycle glass and newspapers and, aluminum cans and plastics.
ny^r	Uh huh .
sd	but that's okay.
sd	It's amazing how much plastic you generate.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and how much we have reduced our waste. You know, that we're generating a week.
sd	And we said to them, if you recycle, you know, you'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container.
sd	The other thing he does, that my husband a real stickler about is we don't collect our grass clippings.
sd	he got a little mulcher thing.
sd	and that has cut down a lot in what we throw out.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	actually they say that you're wasting fertilizer if you're not, catching your grass clippings.
sd	It's amazing.
b^r	Yeah.
ba	that's true.
sd	Well, I really think you're going to get hooked on plastics and paper before you know it.
sd	We keep a large plastic, you know, a garbage bag in the garage.
sd	and then, you know, every few weeks we have a recycling center like near Wal Mart.
sd	And, I feel like at least we're doing something.
sd	If everyone were to recycle just their newspapers, they would save thousands and thousands of trees a day. A day, just from not throwing out your newspapers.
sv	And, when you read that you think, well gee, maybe it is a big deal, you know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	and that's really not necessary.
sd	It would be real nice if they just came by and just picked up.
qw	Now what do they pick up?
qy	they do?
qy	And do you have to sort that?
qrr	Or do you just put it all in.
b^r	Right.
qy	You're doing the newspapers and the glass?
 b	Uh huh.
sd(^q)	My husband would, come home and go through the trash and say, you threw this away .
sd	And now we think before we throw anything away.
sd	it's just making it a habit that's hard .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	that's a lot of fun.
sd	and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans.
sv	The reason there seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced, reporting methods, with computers and other devices.
sv	and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets.
sv	However, I have been persuaded, lately, I guess, simply by the, overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime.
sd^e	I am in Washington D C.
sd	and that again is a sort of media perception there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in Washington. Regardless of the racial makeup,
sd	there's pockets of violence that is so violent that they,
aa	Yeah.
sd	when, previous secretary of, educa , Bennett, I think his name was, became the drug czar, for, President Bush, he was going to focus on this area and do something about it
sd	and I see that even he was met with, with little success, even though I guess a quite a bit of money and other, planning efforts went into that.
sv	One I believe that this is a function of, the violence that young people see on television and the movies.
sd	I think it's Corpus Christi, that had the highest rates per hand gun death in America per capita.
sd	I mean the Saturday night special stuff
qo	what are your views?
aa	Yes.
aa	well that's, that's the impression I get, you know.
sv	it has to be even, magnified to attract people's attention. I guess, to have them spend money on something like that.
sv	And I am sure that it does form role models for young men and young women
sv	And I, I, I have to think that it has some influence on it.
b	Yeah.
nn	No.
ny	yes.
b	Yeah.
sv	and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now, that's complicated the entire process.
sd	or. I do not mean attachment and responsibility,
aa	that's right.
sv	the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that.
sv	it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort.
sv	And the sacrifice is not that great.
b	Yeah.
sv	but yet that does not seem to have effected the amount of violent right in the state.
b	Yeah.
qo	How are we doing in recycling?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and we try to do a lot
sd	but there's still a lot more we can do.
sd	but I noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have like a, a clothes hamper kind of thing that, you know, you lay your string in, then you put your papers in there tie them all up and bundle them up,
sd	so I figured I might get me one of those because we don't always read the newspaper.
sd	and then we just chuck it.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah
sd	I can imagine what it's like up there.
sd	See, I went out to Payless Cashways here a couple of days ago, as a matter of fact, and got me one of those little can crushers that I could put on the wall
sd	and it's just outside the garage door
sd	so every time we drink a Coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket.
sd	and it's actually metal
sd	I didn't want to buy a plastic one.
sd	but it was only like seven dollars, not too bad.
b	Yeah.
sd	it's pretty tough.
sv	you could probably just, you know,
sd	or, see, I work at T I.
sd	We do a lot of recycling out there.
sd	but that's just now come on board.
sd	and we're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big Earth Day thing came out, you know.
sd	T I is doing it pretty well nation wide, I'm sure.
b	yeah.
sd	and what it is is a recycled paper bag
sd	and it's just a paper bag
sd	you know, and it's really cute.
sv	But, I think we're doing better and better all the time,
sv	there's not going to be any room, shortly.
sv	I guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere.
sv	But I think we're getting better at it
sv	I think there's quite a bit more we could do.
sd	But, you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what it would be worth.
b	Yeah.
ba	it sure is.
sv	I guess the schools will get into it, too, sooner or later.
sd	and we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans.
sd	You know, if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people, sure they'll save them for us, there's no problem there.
qh	But what do you do with them in the meantime?
sd	Now I don't want a garage full of cans .
sv	they're not prepared for it.
sd	that's for sure.
b	Yeah.
sd	About the only thing I really recycle around here is aluminum cans.
sv	Well, if we all try a little bit, a little bit goes a long way.
sv	If everybody tries to do just a little bit, and a little bit more then we'll get there. thank you for talking to me.
fc	no problem,
fc	All right,
sv	I think ... I think we have a lousy school system.
sv	They're social services.
sd	So I have some rather strong opinions.
sd	and I'm sure they're colored by what I've edited.
sd	And I was not very happy with the results.
sd	Well, I think I would start with getting rid of about two thirds of the administrators. And all the auxiliary personnel. The school bureaucracy that exists mainly to perpetuate itself.
 sd	And then I would use the money that we've paying them to, provide some special help in training and particularly, mentor teachers to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time .
sd	And then let them try some innovative things and see what works. And then, have some sort of mechanism for passing that knowledge along to other teachers who could benefit from the same sorts of things. And then from the parents side, have the parents support the school. Get involved.
sd	instead of becoming adversaries to the teachers so that the teacher's in the middle.
sd	Well, I've done about all I can do which is get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published and read by a lot of people.
sd	I've got a lot of things to keep me busy.
qy^d	Anything political?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That's more than a lot .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board, you're going to be, rewarding people who've been doing a lousy job. instead of getting the, improvement that we want.
sv	So we'd have to have some way to, reward and recognize the teachers who are doing a good job and give them a, a pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money.
sv	it's hard to tell.
b	Yeah.
ba	Now that's a very good suggestion.
sv	I think that, at least what I used to observe in student teaching, was that some college kid who might not be all that bright to begin with, was thrown into a class room with a teacher who was harried and overworked and, had too many kids to handle and too many things to do and too many interruptions to pay much attention to the student teacher.
sd	And then the student teacher didn't stay but about six weeks.
sv	So there really was no time to try, much of anything and get significant feedback that would help the student teacher improve very much.
sv	There are lots of things that could be done in that line, including things like video taping. Because it wouldn't be hard with all the electronic equipment that's around these days to video tape, either a master teacher teaching a class so that then, students could watch that and, criticize the methods used and analyze it. Figure out what worked and what didn't work.
sd	And then also to video tape the student teachers so they could correct their own performance.
sv	I don't think that's going to work.
sv	And then everybody else is stuck with that, regardless of what they want to teach.
ng	Well, that's the two states that adopt on a state wide basis.
 sd	and all you had to do is just get your share of those adopted in the individual school districts.
sd	And, you know, a third of the Texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks.
sd	And then the states that either don't adopt on a state wide basis or don't have as many kids, just have to follow along and take what Texas gets.
sd	but Texas, adopts state wide all the way through the twelfth grade.
ba	Sure is.
sd	And I hope maybe we're going to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid to it with, Reagan's, new education secretary you know, trying to produce some new programs anyway.
fa	Excuse me.
fc	Thanks.
sd	That's about all.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
ba	that could work.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	right
sv	So that's right off that same kind of principle.
sv	so you know, that could work,
sd^r	Judeo Christian ethic.
b	Yeah.
b^r	right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Really.
ba^r	mine, too.
qw	what part of the country are you from?
b	Okay.
sd	well, I'm from the Dallas area.
ba	well, that's neat.
fc	And it was nice talking to you.
fc	You too.
fp	Hi.
sd	But, I find myself listening to popular music,
sd	but that's not by my choice.
qo	How about you?
ba	Lucky you.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qo	How do you feel about rap music?
sv	It seems to be so popular these days.
b	Right.
qy^d	When it was really just starting.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	A lot of times you'll hear songs that you know, they're not original, but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm.
sd	and yet, she thought they were brand new, original pieces.
ba	That's right.
 aa	No.
sv	I guess there was even a bit of ruckus caused by the M C Hammer, who's really, you know,
qy	Do you remember that song.
sd	I can't remember who the artist was on that.
br	Who?
sd(^q)	Because, it was a living person that I'm thinking of that, that said, "You know, hey that, those are my words."
sd	And, I guess that because they hadn't originally gotten, permission, from him to use it.
sd	And, he since then has amended that, and paid them his royalties every time the song goes on
h	I, I, can't think.
b	Yeah.
sv	They destroyed it.
ba	yeah!
sv	and I thought it was hideous.
sv	ugh, I didn't like that either.
sd	I remember, I saw him in a concert, when I was,
sd	I think it was in high school.
sd	It was in J F K Stadium, if I can remember.
 sd	Hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
aa	No .
sv	You can only laugh .
sv	I guess our age is showing when, we think that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	Like Paul Simon.
b	Yeah.
qw	What do you mean by world music?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	No.
qy^d	So then it becomes a kind of music of it's own, so to speak,
 b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh .
qy	are they trying to ,
sd^t	We've talked our five minutes though.
sd	I've been listening to that a lot lately.
fp	Hi Norma.
qy	Have you taken anything back lately, that you've bought?
qw	Well why?
ba	Very good.
qr	Well do you think that, consumer goods are generally getting better, or worse in quality?
sd	I believe that they're better now,
sv	however, I didn't like it very well when the transmission went out on my car with sixty three thousand miles on it.
sv	And I don't like it very well if, when my electric blanket that was only one year old went out on one side.
sd^e	I had moved away.
sd	and then after one year it started heating only on one side.
sd	Also, I took an iron back after having it only one year.
sv	and one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last.
sd	but I think it was the store.
sd	Wal Mart.
qy	And, well, have you been buying any clothes lately? Any new clothes?
sv	That was poor quality, I think.
sv	I wondered if it weren't expensive,
sv	and they should have put buttons on it that would last forever.
b	Yes.
qy	You spent that much on your dresses?
sv	You're really divulging very personal information.
sv^t	Well I believe that we've been talking about five minutes.
fc	And Norma, it is just wonderful to talk to you.
fc	Bye, bye.
ny	yes.
sd^e	very much.
sd	As a matter of fact, I prefer public television.
sd	And, I particularly enjoy the English comedies, and the English mysteries.
ny	Yes.
na	Vociferously.
b	Yes.
sv	Well, unfortunately for us at least here in the United States, the only access we have to that of course is public television.
sd	I also am very fond of great performances, in that regard.
nn	No ,
sd	as a matter of fact, Turner Broadcasting, has been broadcasting all of the James Bond movies, every night this week,
sd	so I have concentrated on watching James Bond movies, this week .
sd	Well, they're showing LIVE AND LET DIE at this moment,
sd	and, it is the first appearance of Roger Moore as double oh seven.
sv	I was just thinking that today, he did, well, in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate, in his early movies.
o@	but * needs slash yes.
sd	Well, you know when was it, last year or year before last, he was voted the sexiest actor in movies, or something.
sd	I mean the man is sixty two years old.
sd	And I, I particularly enjoy, I don't know whether you've had a chance to watch it on P B S but the series, YES MINISTER?
sd	it was a comedy,
sd	the Interior Minister in England, with the permanent secretary, and bureaucracy and all that.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I read as I said, quite a bit.
sd	I read about two or three novels a week, in addition to all the technical stuff.
qw	What kind of work do you do?
qy^d	At T I?
bk	I see.
sd	and I just wondered.
sv	I think that's something we all ca ,
sd^e	I work for G T E. In Maryland,
ny	yes.
sd	they are gathering a data base for voice processing.
sd	And, that's my field of work also.
sd	so I called them and asked if I could participate. And, You know send in the forms et cetera and so forth.
co	We could go back to television shows.
sd^e	I have.
sv	you could interpret it that way.
sv	but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the Bible itself is probably after the what, is it the King James Version when the committee wrote the translation, that so much was lost in the translation, particularly since most of the translations were in Greek.
sd	Well, for example. In Greek there are seven different words for love.
sv	So, as to those types of interpretations, really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now, and what it's at.
sv	but there's too much historical fact involved just from the histories that were developed around that time, that are available. To deny that, at least the majority of it is true.
h	So, you know, it depends on how you look at it.
sv	if you want to say that it's proven that it isn't true, then you can very much look at it that way.
sv	well, Well, you can interpret what the T V show, in the same way that you can interpret the Bible.
sd	But, as far as that goes, we at least agree on what we enjoy.
sd	But, I don't know if there is a time limit on this, so,
fc	it's been very pleasant talking to you,
fc	and have a good evening.
fc	Good night!
sd	You know, I used to like ST. ELSEWHERE.
sd	and now, I did like THIRTY SOMETHING
sd	We like that one.
qw	and how old are you?
sd	I think it's wonderful.
sd	And then Sunday nights we watch, LIFE GOES ON.
qy	Did you see the one on Sunday?
sd	That one kid that Becca likes he has AIDS.
qw	What time is it there?
sd	See, I'm twenty minutes to six here .
qw	What else do you like?
sd	I never watched that ever in my entire life.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Talk to my daughter.
sd	I used to watch GENERAL HOSPITAL when I was a teenager because I,
b	Oh.
b	Right.
sd	I like the people on it, I guess, you know.
qy^g	well, Tad's going to come back, I bet, do you think?
sd	He'll come back, show up at just the right moment.
b	Oh.
sd	and, I forgot about Nina and Cliff, right.
ba	So he's out for good.
qy^d	Nina and Cliff?
sd	so, I don't watch it everyday like I did when I had babies.
sd	so, I don't get to watch,
ba	no kidding.
sd	I used to be like that .
qy	Now don't they have a new chick on there instead of what's her name?
sd^e	That's a show I like.
ba	yeah,
sd	Well, I just know which one she is.
qy^d	Charlene was Delta Burke?
sd	and my whole family's home, because I don't allow the kids out on Sunday night you know, because they've got to go to bed and go to school the next day,
sv	Those are always pretty cute.
qy^d	so you don't watch that one instead of,
sd	we like that real well.
sd	I don't know who it is, though,
o	books.
sd	Mainly I read the Bible these days.
sd	and Christian literature.
sv	but it seems as though if you really want to set side time to read the Bible and you work and and whatever, that pretty well takes up your time for reading.
sd	It's getting, to where a just really want to read it.
bh	Do you?
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Have you ever read any of Frank E Peretti's?
qw	how old is your daughter.
sd	and they're all spiritually, oriented,
b	yeah.
sd	Frank E Peretti,
sd	P E R E T T I.
sd	because, I love to read his, children's books just ,
sv	they're great.
sd	And it's like, usually about a family of, archaeologists and the spiritual fights that they get into, like, digging in old ruins, and running across, like, the old gods and things.
sv	It's real exciting.
sd	And it also teaches them spiritual warfare you know,
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, it's hard for me.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and especially it's hard to keep your interest in those begats.
b	that's right.
sd	I've read a lot of his, too.
sd	Can't put them down.
b	yeah.
sv	you know when you're recording you can't remem ,
sd	Dean, Kratz, or Kranz
br	who?
sd^e	it's a guy.
sd	It's that real, gruesome , horror stories.
sd	his last name ends in a Z, I know that.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	it's one of his first books, THE STAND.
sd	And that seems like all of his books have kind of come from that, I mean.
sd	I thought it was great.
ba	yes .
sd	those hedges when they started moving.
sd	For some reason that scared me more than anything.
b	Yeah.
sv	And that was a pretty scary movie, too.
b	Yeah .
ba	That's right.
sd	I liked IT as well.
sd	That's, another big fat one.
sd	except it broke my heart.
sd	I'm a dog lover.
sd^e	it was,
 br	What?
sd	I've read that one, too.
sd	Boy, he just sits down eight hours a day. Just like any other job.
sd	That one about the Gypsies, or that, hunger
sd	Richard Bachman.
sv	he's so prolific.
sd	and, after I graduated, I read some of the old classics that I just bluffed my way through and have found that I enjoy them quite a bit, too,
sv	Once you can get into the language,
sd	but it's not the same English they speak today.
sd	So it's kind of hard to keep, you know, at it,
sv@	their worthwhile. Literature?
sd	me, too.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Nathaniel Hawthorne is pretty scary himself.
ar	No,
sd@	he wrote JANE EHRE, too . / * spelling Eyre?
b	Yeah.
b	uh huh.
b^r	right.
sd	That's why I like to watch that MASTERPIECE THEATRE on channel thirteen, because they'll take a classic and, televise it you know, put it into a viewing format, more or less.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Do you?
ba	Well, I can imagine.
sv^t	Well, I think we've accomplished five minutes
fc	It's good talking to you.
qw	Well, what's your favorite baseball team, Rita?
no	Well, that isn't a true false or right or wrong test here.
qy^g	Not a Cubbies fan,
bd	Well, that's all right.
qo	How do you expect them to do this year?
bk	Okay.
sd	and, in South Dakota, the Minnesota Twins are the closest professional sports team to where I was living
sd	and the other one was country.
sd	There's was Twins there, or, you know Skip Williams.
aa^r	it sure was.
sd	Well, I I would like to a , assume that they're going to do better this coming year,
sd	When we moved down, I was able to go to my first, you know baseball game, and thought, this is great, this is incredible.
sd	or rather they adopted me, I guess
sv	But when you go to the ball park, it's really not all that far you know,
sv	and it's so much more exciting watching a ball come at you,
ba^r	that's right.
b^m	The Restaurant Ha ,
b	Huh.
b	Right.
ba	That's right
sv	and he's still doing great still doing excellent.
qy	Well, didn't he just sign a twelve year contract with the Rangers?
b	Right.
ba	That's right.
sd	like, Ivan Rodriguez wasn't even born when, Nolan Ryan started pitching.
sv	And it's just incredible to think that there are players who are the sons of ball players that used to play against Nolan or with Nolan, you know,
sd	and now their sons are.
sd^e	I wasn't.
qy^g	Ryan against Ryan,
ba	Well that is neat.
b	Uh huh.
 b	Right.
ad	Your turn.
qy^d	But not for petty theft?
qy	Well, it should be used as a deterrent do you think?
qy@	to prevent further, crime? 
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, you know, there's this old, Jewish, is it, saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
sv	So if you have someone that destroys that value then you want to take steps to, minimize the loss.
sv	Of course, you have to also put value on the criminal.
sv	So if you terminate him, that's a loss of value.
sv	In other words, you'd have to murder more than one other person in order to justify taking his life.
sv	So if this guy doesn't make a great deal of money, which is often times the case, then then he's obviously not worth very much
 sv	Of course, one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm, is you find that it's easier to, to, terminate older people than younger people since the integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less. Which means, well
sv	I suppose you could say, well that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation.
b	Uh huh.
sd	But if you're involved yourself, personally
sd	and, you're talking about real trauma. I mean trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies.
sv	of course, a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get, I think, in terms of psychological impact.
sd	and he is on trial for capital murder.
 %	but ,
qy	Do you have any hobbies?
qw	What are yours?
ba	how great.
o	ceramic painting.
b^m	The china more.
sv	That sounds so interesting.
ba	How marvel ,
qrr	or do you actually sell it?
qy	now, do you work outside of the home?
bf	You've just retired.
sv	what a great hobby .
sd	and he left it up to me if I worked or not.
sd	so I enjoy doing my, toppers for my window applications and things like that.
sd	But, just when I thought I really enjoyed my hobby, yours sounds great .
ba	That is excellent.
sd	and I'm just intrigued with it.
sd	where you're getting into the delicate work.
qw	Now, where did you first get your lessons from?
qy^d	Through an adult ed, or strictly a china type,
ba	how marvelous.
ba	and it's so nice,
sv	It must be so nice for you, now that you're retired.
sd	And you'll probably really, regain your enthusiasm for it once you get into a class again.
sv	But really, people get upset at taxes because it's more efficient to do things yourself.
qy	Have you, you know, ever thought, you know, just how much of that money should go to other people that really don't deserve it?
sv	Well, the thing of it is, if I wanted to just, you know, permanently become a book reader, I guess I could just, you know, go on public assistance, you know lo , look for, look for people to, take care of me.
^g	right?
sv	And then you don't have to be on the tax roll.
sd	so I wind up getting money back from my, withholding.
sd	and I should calculate it better.
sd	So I'm a federal employee.
qy^g	Guess I don't sound like it
sv	I've got all four feet in the trough, you know, being a federal employee.
sd	Like every time there is a bond issue you know, I vote no on every one of them.
sv	most of us have all four feet in the trough, you know. Plus our snout, right up to our ears.
sv	So, you know, it's not exactly that kind of a place that you want to, you know, get into a tax revolt situation.
sv	in this particular area, you know, I think I pay about, thirty five hundred for taxes on my four bedroom house, you know. And which is a lot of money.
sv	and, and so as people get older and older, you know, they think about retirement and that sort of thing
^g	right?
sd	You know. in, instead, it's the taxes here
sv	Course I don't know whether I want to go to Bulverde or not, you know or Seguin or someplace like that.
sv	and I'm saying well, you know, I really can't stay here, as a retiree.
sv	It's too expensive.
sd	I'm going to have go out you know, in, you know, East Fork someplace. and, do my thing, you know.
sd	And they're not doing it again, you know.
qy^d	you must be a T I employee.
qy^d^r	You must be a T I employee?
qw	who do you work for?
sd	and I have a few ideas of, how to combat it.
sd	so That's one thing
sd	that's, that's crime that you can't fight it if you need that money.
qrr	or does it stay in the bad neighborhoods?
qy^d	So that's a big concern if you live there, is to really lock your car up .
sd	we were there just, well for a lay over
sd	and we drove into San Juan to catch our plane.
sd	and they look at you crazy
sd	you don't go on the beach.
sd	it's very safe in the daytime
sd	but at night, they even have the policemen come around at dusk and sound their sirens, pretty much telling people, be wary, you know, and get off the beach.
sd	Well, what they say they try to do is to get the kids, early and young.
sd	And what we have here in Burlington, which it doesn't cost a lot of money, but they have a kids council that they have all these after school activities for kids.
sd	They have a big brother, big sister program.
sd	And it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs after school, you might keep them
sv	so that your mom doesn't have a job
sv	You don't have to live you know, for a street life.
sd	I mean, they can deal with that scale.
sd	They might have five hundred troubled youths.
sd	and they're selling drugs
sd	and they've got a fifteen year old that's their boss that is carrying a gun.
sv	it's not, they don't care about anybody
sv	these people they're stealing from, they're just the big bad rich guy
^q	and we should take it.
b	Yes.
sd	We're talking these kids are fourteen years old.
sv	The parents might be thirty years old
sv	and the kids are just sitting there in the same room.
sv	It's just that they have absolutely no morals
sv	and it's really sad.
sd	But I like your idea of education
sv	I mean if the parents aren't supplying it, they've got to get it from someone else from the schools,
sv(^q)	the parents might have hostilities towards them, you know, Like you're judging us,
sv	and I'm not good enough to raise my child, which basically is true
sd	I'm glad I don't live in a big city I mean, not just because I wouldn't feel safe,
sd	it's just because that I would be reminded every day of something that I don't see,
sd	and I might see it on you know, a SIXTY MINUTES special.
sd	I mean, they have all kinds of nice write ups about it
^2	but any big city has a bad section.
 sv	they're very bold it seems.
sv	if I did it every night I think there would be trouble in our house,
sd	so you wouldn't get confronted or anything
sv	but they're not going to grab you, steal your money and slit your throat which in a lot of big cities
sv	People are just totally unfeeling.
qy	Do you have any children?
b^m	Twelve and sixteen.
sd	and, they're five and three and nineteen months.
sv	So we kind of got different ball game
sv	They're probably at an age where they don't want to spend any time with their parents.
b	Right.
b	uh huh.
b	Right.
 b	Sure.
ba	well, that's nice.
b^r	You're stuck together.
b	No.
sd	I would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part.
b	Right.
^2	And so that kind of gives him, time with his dad, then.
sd	Gives him a little bit of that individual time.
sv	and they want to be able to spend,
sd	and every day that she's not at school, she thinks we need to have someone over and play
sd	I think, I find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that I should .
sd	the kitchen needs to be cleaned
sd	and and I need to remind myself to slow down
sd	and it'll still be there tomorrow.
sv	But that's kind of hard to do, you know.
sv	You don't see yourself getting.
b	Right.
^2	Slow down a little bit.
b	uh huh.
qy^d	You can do, more than than when you travel.
sd	but, that's an opportunity to get out the games
b^m	of course.
b	yeah.
bf	Wouldn't take it apart after that.
ba	That'd be kind of fun.
b^m	right.
sv	In fact in, I think if people would learn to turn off the T V s
sv	I think that's a lot of the breakdown of the communication
sv	usually people are not sitting in front of that.
bh	and you can't communicate while you're doing that, right?
sd	but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without doing something.
^2	Because they talk so much,
sv(^q)	You're kind of like, what are you talking about
sd	and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs, such as Peace Corps that promote that.
sd	and, in order to get Eagle, you have to have merit badges in, citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation, citizenship in the world
sv	and you have to do a public service project. in which leadership is the key element.
sv	I think the question is posed somewhat strangely because, it's talking about a requirement for public service
sd	and, of course, the Peace Corps, the Boy Scouts is a voluntary activity.
sv	of course, military service falls under the category, of a public service.
sv	And, so, one of the things that would fulfill at least the nominal, qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft.
sd	There are other things such as civil service which many people, are lifelong employees of
sv	More of a voluntary kind of thing
b	Uh huh.
qo	Why?
qo	Why is that?
sv	It's to defend the nation against external evils.
sv	Well, it depends on whether we figure that we have a defense oriented military or an aggression oriented military.
sv	you know there are so many ramifications to this entire thing of woman, how women have changed,
sd	in England, Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, Indira Ghandi , in India,
sv	I think we'll have a black president before we have a women president.
sd	it's just a point that I have observed that we,
 b	Right.
b	oh.
sd	I think, we're supposed to hang up.
b	Yes.
fc	Bye, bye.
sd	and then that's get rid of the half of the government payroll.
qy^d	you know, I don't know if you've ever been to Washington D C.
sv	and in light of these, hearings we've all been sitting through the last two weeks, we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed.
sv	They really don't have enough to keep them busy to keep their noses in their own business of what they're doing.
sv	I have a real problem with all the foreign aid that is going to the countries that really have no use for us.
sv	but I believe in taking an active part in politics,
 b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
 b	Uh huh.
sv	The biggest part is they have no accountability for what they're doing.
sv	I mean this nonsense that's coming through now about, lowering payments on Social Security and a few other things that Bush has in mind in order to boost the economy because people have more money as gets, it's ridiculous.
sv	If they don't have that money now, bringing in less is not going to help the problem as far as the government.
sd	and thank God we don't operate our budget, the way they operate theirs or we'd all be in dire trouble.
sv	that's the way they're thinking these days anyway.
sd	maybe if they ever get to the point you know, the biggest outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense.
 sv	If they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic, you know, intergovernmental or inter United States like programs that one really might.
sv	But, again I don't think we'll be able to do anything about it,
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
qy^g	She's not the one going to Washington,
b	Oh .
sv^t	We've probably been on long enough.
fc	so it was nice talking to you.
fc	Okey doke.
qo	what do you think about, the idea of having volunteer service for everyone?
qy	Well, are you doing any kind of volunteer work now?
qy	What about, when would people do it, when they finished high school?
sv	and I think it gives a different perspective.
qw	The only complication is, is how do you fund something like this?
sd	I think the Mormon church sends out missionaries that,
qy	do you think that would be reasonable?
qw	What would you have these people do if they were brought in?
sd	say that, say that it was mandatory.
sd	my father was in the C C C .
sd	Well, it seems that there's some things like the programs at least just go around and, and clean up streets and, and pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things.
sd	, and a lot of the buildings in downtown areas that either need demolishing, or need fixing up,
fc	Well, it was good talking to you, Betty.
fc	Have a good night.
b	Right.
qw	how way back, I mean
sd	so Wally Moon moon shots and all that.
sd	coliseum, Wally Moon and all that.
sd	and, Wally Moon is the manager of them.
sd^e	so he's still kicking around.
qy	Is that the stadium?
sd	So, there used to be a, race track.
sd	that was impression I got when I was there
sd	It's cheaper for one thing .
sd	I don't understand why Encovilla got released.
bh	Why get rid of him now?
b	Okay.
sd	he fits right in I mean with Detroit, bunch of guys that hit home runs and strike out a lot.
sd	I mean, if I were in Detroit, I would start building the team around Fielder.
sd	But that doesn't mean get three other guys who hit, all they can do is hit home runs and strike out you know, which they did.
sd	I think the pitching's deep enough that it doesn't matter.
sd	I'm a Giants fan from way back.
sd	and Bobby Ojeda didn't hurt
sd	They got him from the Mets for Hubie Brooks.
sd	he's a pretty decent pitcher.
b	Okay,
sd	And, that guy , the short stop, is going to be good.
sd	and I should have been to two
sd	and you know, I do enjoy them.
sd	I've had an opening day on Monday.
qw	How far is Houston?
sd	keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes.
sd	you know, we're pretty lucky because if I want to see a National League team, I can usually go up to Philadelphia.
sd	And, saw the Cardinals and Cubs last year, and a bunch of teams the year before.
b	Okay,
sd	I mean, I've been to like thirty or forty games each of the last few years.
sd	so it's like so much for going to lots of baseball games.
ba	seriously.
fc	and you'll be happy I think in October when the Dodgers win.
fc	I'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be right .
fc	Take care.
ad	Think about, taxes.
sd^t	so, I guess the question was more like, do you you know, get what you pay for.
b	Yeah.
ba	I agree with that.
sd	I will this year anyway from a,
sd	I need it, too,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^2	More taxes you pay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
sv	there's a yeah, lot of hidden taxes.
sv	the, the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay, I guess.
sd	one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the tax codes they have now and implementing I think a flat percentage, something like that.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Exactly.
sd	usually the reason I will turn it on is to hear the news.
sd	But I don't think of that every day, even.
sd	I teach a college class
sd	And so I often drop in on a break and and read it.
sd	And I keep the radio on quite a bit when I'm home.
sd	And then I figure if there's big news, I'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or, someone else, you know.
b	Uh huh.
qy	do you get a news magazine
b	Uh huh.
qy	Are you satisfied with the quality of coverage?
sv	it's kind of hard to know.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an earthquake or sliding or something,
sd	I don't ever hear it in the news here.
b	Yeah.
sv	I sometimes feel like, the Dallas paper and the DALLAS NEWS, the top headlines are always a murder, you know.
 b	Yeah.
 ba	I'm sure.
b	Uh huh.
sd	you know, I mean, there's even the C N N channel where we can get world news twenty four hours a day.
b	Yeah .
sv^t	I guess we can end.
sv^t	it's just whenever we're,
qy^t	Have you always gone until the recording?
sv^t	I guess we're not supposed to .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qw	so what kind of car are you thinking about getting?
sd	Well, when you decide to.
b	Uh huh.
qy	So you like the Ford?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	the car I had before this one was a Thunderbird as a matter of fact,
sd	So I bought myself a, a Nissan a two forty S X.
sd	But even though I love the car I've got now, I think my next car will probably be American again because if I can at all do it, I'd like to stay American,
sd	I just for one time decided to go outside.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, Ford's done a real good job in the last, say, ten years or at least the last five to six years, of really turning around their, quality, I think,
b	Uh huh.
sv	those were not good cars.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	But, I don't have any plans for probably another two, three years of even looking, you know.
 sv	cars are too expensive right now to, to even think about buying new cars every couple of years, you know
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	that's how expensive they were.
sd	and even though I, I do enjoy cars, I enjoy, driving them, I enjoy, riding in them and everything, but, I can't see or paying more for a car than I would for a house, you know.
sv	That doesn't seem likely.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
na	I think so.
sd^t	That's happened to me once,
sd^t	like, I think the one time I did it was on the Mid, the Mid East, the crisis out there.
sd^t	but, then they came off and told us we couldn't do it any more.
b	Yeah.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	Someplace that's very different than Texas.
 sd	maybe as the summer heat comes along I would sort of like going somewhere where it's not so hot. And being able to be outside, enjoy outside activities,
sd	A pool is great.
sd	we have plans this year to drive up to the, to Colorado.
sd	And, we will be going to Estes Park, and Colorado Springs,
sd	One year we went to the southwest corner of Colorado, into Durango and north of the area there.
sd	there's a nice train ride that goes up to the city of Silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining.
sd	I, and then there's lots and lots of mountains that are covered with, boulders.
sd	But, I sure would like to go back there and do that again.
sd	but I have heard it's wonderful.
b	Right.
sd	and the, beach is nice,
qy^g	the beach is really nice, isn't it.
^2	Sea shells.
sd	Sea shells.
b	Yeah.
sd	we just have not gone that direction yet.
b	Okay.
b	Right.
ba	That's nice.
ba	Great.
ba	nice.
b	Oh.
sd	Well, we have just we have just,
qy	Are you driving?
sd	well, starting at the end of July, we will have two vacation weeks in October and two vacation weeks in March.
 sd	So that will be an interesting turn on vacations for our family.
sd	what it truly is supposed to mean is nine weeks of school, three weeks of vacation, nine weeks of school, three weeks of vacation.
sd	and they hope to boost the learning of the children. Just the retention of the material for them.
b	Yeah,
sd	anyway, so maybe within a year, we will see how that falls .
sd	we will head for Florida, maybe in somewhat of an off season, instead of summer.
ad^t	Well, that's probably all we need to do today.
fc	Alright.
fc	Thanks a lot.
qw	so what kind of movies have you seen, lately, I guess?
qy^d	Obviously you have kids.
sd	I haven't seen that one yet.
sd	the last movie I saw was, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.
sd	see, I'm not a big Julie Roberts fan.
sd	But I was a lot more impressed with her than I thought I would be.
sd	It turned out to be a better thriller than I was expecting it to be.
sv	it was a pretty good movie.
 sd	it's, you know, hasn't worked out that way yet.
sd	You know, it looks good, you know if you like thrillers, anyway.
sd	In fact, people I've talked to said that they hadn't slept real good for a while afterwards.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Well, what other movies have you seen then lately?
sd	I assume you were talking about the new NINJA TURTLES.
sd	I mean, I'm sure I'm going to be seeing it because in a week to Amarillo where my sister lives, and she's got two boys that I took to see the first one.
sd	So I'm sure I'm going to see the next one here real soon.
ba	well, then it won't be too bad.
sv	but it was better than it could have been.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think that's important if you know, if you're going, kids are going to, parents are going to have to go you ought to make it at least semi , you know, semi for them too.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I's about to say, you're not going to take her to that one, I'm sure.
qy	or do you go to a lot of comedy movies
qw	What was the last comedy you saw?
sd	in fact I guess this was the last movie I saw
sd	the last movie I saw was THE HARD WAY with Michael J. Fox.
sd	you know, he's this actor, right
sd	and he's playing a cop.
sd	I think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop.
sd	And I was so impressed with that because, you know, usually,
sd	because, I mean, everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying you know, to imitate them or whatever.
sd	And, I thought he did such an excellent job of not going that far.
sd	Now, by the end he was looking more like a cop. But at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part, you know, he was trying to get it,
sd	but he wasn't there yet.
sv	I think they did a real good job of that.
sv	And James Woods, I think is who it was, did an excellent job as the cop.
 +	with him in there.
sd	So, I, I've seen it the second time not too long ago.
sd	I thought that would be one of those that I would love to watch over and over.
sd	maybe it's just the idea of my reaction to the first time. I had laughed so hard I was hoarse.
sd	I was hoarse getting out of there.
sd	I mean, it just wasn't as funny the second time because I had just gone overboard the first time.
h	I don't know
sd	I loved the movie.
sd	I love those movies.
aa	yeah.
ar	Well, you have to see them more than that.
sd	I, I still catch things in AIRPLANE that I didn't catch.
sd	I love those movies
sd	I really do.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	You know, but that's at least the good thing about the Texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper.
sd(^q)	and then all of a sudden I'm saying I wish I'd bought these things.
sd	And then if you want popcorn and stuff just, I mean, it's incredible. No,
ba	nowhere near that expensive.
sv	I mean, it's as simple as that.
sv	and as long as we keep paying the money for it, they are going to keep paying them.
sv	that was an excellent movie.
ad	don't.
sv	That needs the big screen.
sv	It really and truly does, because to get the feeling of like when they're chasing the buffalos and everything
 +	you've got to be where you feel it.
sv	You really truly do.
sv	I mean, that was one movie I came out impressed.
sd	None at all.
sd	Normally I'm one of these people that I don't like one movie taking all the honors.
sd	I wanted him to win best actor on top of it,
sd	Like I said, I wouldn't given the supporting actresses either one.
sd	It was just too perfect at all times.
sv	They shouldn't have done it.
sd	so you know, I can see that.
ng	well there is one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side.
sd	it's just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped the hides.
b	Yeah,
sd	they really don't.
sv	if she enjoys movies I think it'll work pretty good.
sd	it's, it's a long movie.
b	yeah.
sd	I may have to see the video.
sd	I hadn't even thought of that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	there are certain things you can't do with a video
sv	and the idea that they may put a little extra in it I think is a good idea.
sd	videos, of course, are not cheap either
sd	and so the idea of getting a little extra with it I think is a good idea. Because they make bundles of money off those things.
^2	but not enough.
sv^t	So, well, this is an appropriate topic the day after Earth Day,
qw	well, what do you think is, the main pollutants in the air?
sd	but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and, you know, how we're affecting the Earth and things by what we do, as the people
sd	and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot,
sd	but it's incredible that you know, they don't, they're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air.
sd	you know, they're supposed to be regulated because we have a plant, I don't know about T I but we have a Pillsbury plant, in a town adjacent to ours,
sd	of course, you wouldn't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals,
sd	but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of what they do, to, make their dough and to, clean out the flour and stuff like that,
 sd	and they clean up their act, but on a normal basis that they're dumping things,
 sd	and I'm like, if they're getting away with it, can you imagine,
sd	I can't imagine plants,
sd	they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff, you know to break the flours down
sv	but toxic can be anything that's classified that can damage the Earth.
sv	So, there could be a lot of things that they could put, you know, that chemical wise that they use to, that they are testing with, that they're dumping.
b	Yeah.
sd	I don't think they do the packaging at this plant,
sd	and they do, do a lot of the refining up there
sd	what's it called when you do flour,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but I would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down or stream or such,
sd	or you can, you know, do, testing on the ground itself at that point,
sd	unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution, you know, like in Los Angeles or the bigger cities where it tends to get stuck there,
sd	you know, that you have a lot more particles in the air,
 +	you know, per, per particles in the surrounding community because it's not moved away,
b	Uh huh.
sd	it's where Stillwater is or, sweet,
sd	it's called Dublin,
sd	Stephenville.
sd	where Stephenville's at, they've had a lot of problems because they've, introduced a lot of dairies there,
sd	it's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free,
sd	and I read in this article, I couldn't believe it, where, you know, like, one cow like, a day, produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure.
sd	and they've added humus and stuff that, breaks it down,
sd	you know, they're water, they're natural water,
sd	it's like a spring water,
sd	it's not very far down,
sd	and all this stuff is seeping through to the water,
sd	and like, they're afraid that, you know, within a certain amount of years, they're water in that town will be totally polluted,
sd	and they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have, completely polluted, so that you know, there's too many toxins and bacterial growth,
sd	and I'm like my God, you know, you know, just from them introducing dairy farms, in that one county.
sd	and they were talking like, thousands of cows, you know, they were talking thousands cows in one little tiny area.
sd	But, I mean, evidently a normal cow produces that much too,
sd	but they're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it's not, you know, a problem,
sd	and they said that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff, and taking it to, these like ponds that they had to filter it with,
sd	but the ponds because they've had so much rain in the past few years, they just, overflow
sd	it said the creeks will foam.
sd	people stand outside their houses and watch the creeks foam brown and all,
sd	and the smell is really bad they sa ,
sd	and, channel thirteen they're really, emphasizing the problem with acid rain, you know,
 sv	if we keep putting that stuff into the air and, you know, if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it it's really going to be a problem for, the Earth, you know, what the Earth is receiving back, you know, because how can you tell where it's going to come down at.
^2	The rain forest and all.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, they do because, what is it, carbon dioxide, they use that where we can't synthesize it
sd	and they're synthesizing it for us.
b	Yeah.
sv	I suppose, you know, if you just make sure your car is, is working properly
sv	seems like they've only just really started as far as the environment saying, okay, we're really going to get involved
sd	what kind of results are we going to have for the environment.
 sd	Both.
ny	Yes.
ny	Uh huh.
qr	Well, are you Summit or are you, Spring Creek?
qw	What building are you in?
sd^t	I've never had a call,
sd^t	I got a woman in New Jersey the last time I called, I think.
aa	That is funny.
qy	Are you a native to Texas?
qw	From?
qw	So what do you think of the Texas weather?
qw	How long have you been here?
bk	okay.
qy^d	you, you know about August then.
sv	there's no surprises left.
ba	Real good idea.
sd	We went to Alaska.
sd	It is so cool, you wear a jacket, you know.
sd	or keep one handy. Because it rains a lot in Alaska.
sd	and then it rains just enough to keep everything nice and moist and very green. And blooming.
fe	my goodness, it's pretty.
sv	Well, Texas isn't bad.
sv	Not in the Spring.
 sv	Spring is nice.
b	Right.
sd	we always we always do though.
b	Right.
b	really.
sv	you got into that bad stuff.
ba	Isn't that strange.
sv	and you very seldom see it though.
qy	Is that correct?
sv	I think that's,
sd	but in the clouds it is.
sd	I was in, Florida for a week on business.
sd(^q)	I said, Okay, you know
sd	Finally I got home and found out my property was okay.
sv	But I guess you just tend to think of where your house is you know, and nothing else.
b	I see.
b	okay.
sd	that house, that I bought is close to a Firewheel golf course.
sd	Just going to be blocks off of that new highway one ninety that's going through.
b	really.
qy	Is that a nice area?
ny^r	yes.
sd	Really, really nice home, very pretty.
sd^e	I'm going to lease it.
sd	it's investment property.
sd	and, you know, I've got everything just exactly like I want it.
sd	It's a nice house.
sd	I'm going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course versus where my house is.
sd	But it's in the estates that adjoin it.
sd	it is.
sd	that one nine that one ninety is just going to be the the outer , outermost loop around.
sd	just continue to do that.
qw	Where are you from in California?
qy^d	San Diego?
sd	I've been through all of that.
sd	they're more like just huge boulders with very little vegetation.
sd	I had to go up to T I on business a couple years ago
co	Let me just quick .
aa	Yes
sd	beyond Thousand Oaks.
qy^d	You don't think that's strange looking.
sd	maybe I'm used to Texas.
sd	The elevation is extremely high.
b	Right.
sd	It was interesting. Because we went out the Ventura highway to Thousand Oaks and on up through that way.
sd	it's green sometime.
sd	Well, it doesn't stay green, you know
sd	We haven't had a really bad one,
qy^d	I, I, assume you have kids .
sd	well she doesn't have to worry about public schools yet.
sd	I was a substitute teacher for about a year.
sd	but before I went through all of that I wanted to see how I was going to like it.
sd	So I went out and played substitute for a while and decided, nope, not for me.
sd	I just took grades one through six.
sd	I thought I was going to be smart and get the good kids, wrong.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh .
sd	Those little kids don't understand it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	Well, that's a nice way of putting it.
^2	And too, most people don't have that option.
sd	I've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy it doesn't matter what you do. accept for the private ones, of course, we're talking about public.
 sd	Back when I was going to school you just didn't get away with the things these kids get away with now.
sd	I mean you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal's office and, usually bending over to get five of the best,
sv	but nowadays they can barely scold the children for something, you know, without getting sued.
sd	And I didn't believe it for a minute.
sd	not a lot I could do about it.
sd	Can't stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants.
sd	well let's just say he was one of those types that you wouldn't doubt that he was selling something.
sd	But not a lot I could do about it.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I mean it, alleviates your problem
sd	but it doesn't do anything for them.
sv	it's something.
sv	I mean, i , it's indicative across the board that we've done something wrong.
sv	we can't balance a checkbook without a calculator.
h	I don't know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	No.
sd	that's a great deal what law schools like .
ny	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
sd	and then you get one examine for the whole semester
sd	and it's how well you can remember it all.
sd	And I found that a particularly useless way of studying.
sd	I always tried to understand things, not tried to memorize.
sv	but they couldn't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned.
sd	I didn't want to be a lawyer anyway, just wanted the degree.
bh	What can we do about it?
sv	Money, Money is not the answer.
sv	and things are getting worse.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	as much as I didn't like school when I was going through it, from my perspective now I can see that it's a lot better than what we have now.
sv	And I think part of it is that they've got to give authority back to the local school.
sv	You know, I mean, it's silly that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline.
sv	I, I mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something, to students because they're going to get complaints or they're going to get sued or something.
ba	yeah.
sv	Well, lawyers help create that .
sv	and he's out of our hair.
sv	And the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents.
sv	you, you can, you can have the best school system in the world if you don't get anything at home then it's not going to help either.
sd	I don't know what the answer is.
qy	do they allow it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I remembering reading a few cases about when it, when some people first tried that and they got sued. Got taken to court by the school system.
sd	that's the way you got your education in this country.
sd	I am pretty much against it .
qo	How about you?
sv	we can have a debate.
sd	one of the reasons that I'm against it is that, I'm afraid of someone losing their life, for wrongly,
aa	Right
sd	and I thought, well, the loss that I would feel at losing my mother someone else would feel that about that person no matter how rotten they were, somebody loves them .
qo	How about you?
ba	that's true.
b	Uh hum.
sd^t	Well you know that's true, because a lot of these conversations I've had on this program this these telephone conversations have revolved around criminal you know justice.
sv	and we need to have different punishments you know.
sd	but I just am scared of capital punishment, I guess.
b	Right.
sv	If it's no one that I know then you have to think about the taxpayers paying the shelter and feed and clothe them for the rest of their life.
^2	Letting him out again .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but, I do know that they are notorious for paroling people.
sd	and then having them reconvicted for violent crimes.
sv	because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment
sv	I guess violent crimes would be the crimes where I can see it making the most sense.
sv	You know, violent crimes with just malicious intent.
b	Yeah.
 ^2	Hang? .
bh	And what is he going to do prison to the other people ?
sd	she was off drugs and everything,
sd	You know, people find ways around.
sv	it's not that bad of a life as it should be for the punishment aspect.
sv	and maybe that's one of the reasons why crime has gone up, because it's not so scary anymore.
^2	And what they're going to be doing when they get out .
b	I see.
qy	Do you have any pets now?
qy	the dog is Joey?
sd	The cat is,
ba	my goodness.
ba	my .
br	I beg your pardon.
qy^d	Well did you all catch it,
b	Uh huh.
qy	did you catch the fish?
sd	and it's all alone in that aquarium.
sd	Well at the present time I have two dogs.
sd	and it has, yellow spots on it which they call, I think, liver spots.
sd	And I have a wonderful female lab, black lab.
sd	and, she has hip dysplasia.
sd	And it's in that breed.
sd	But now I think there are tests that can be conducted, to tell whether or not the puppies have it.
sd	apparently they've been so well I don't know inbred, or what,
sd	and if you should have one, that also has hip dysplasia you cannot breed it,
sd	but she's wonderful.
qw	what are the what are the symptoms?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
sd	let's see, winter before last we would bring her in, when it was cold.
sd	I couldn't get her up without picking her up which it was pretty hard to do at eighty pounds.
sd	if I allowed her to not get up on her own, it'd be two o'clock in the afternoon.
sd	I'm kind of glad to be able to tell people about this, because you all the time, you know, run into people with problems.
sd	they give it to race horses, to get rid of, cartilage,
sd	and then I noticed after two shots she was,
sd	but I can't give a shot.
sd	Then I didn't notice any improvement till after the sixth one.
sd	and he said, a booster, every year or two, I mean, maybe every six months or something like that
sd	but they've really never used it.
sd	like I think German Shepherds do it, and probably large dogs.
sd	And, it's just wonderful.
sd	I just don't let them, go away from me,
sd	but we take walks through the woods twice a day.
sd	And, I can over do it on her.
sd	and she's not limping along and all that.
ad	Tell me about your cat.
qr	And is, Stripper an inside cat, or outside?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
ba	That's nice,
qy^g	and you've kept it up, haven't you.
sd	I just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while.
sd	So that made me very proud .
qy^t	Well, have we been talking five minutes?
sd	I'm not either,
ny	Yes.
b	uh huh.
sd^t	and, after about twelve minutes or something, the recording came on and said that was the end of the tape .
sd^t	but it's been so much fun too, talk.
sd^t	Well, my best friend in Virginia's daughter, is a part of this project in Texas.
sd^t	And so she knew that I had the time and would enjoy it.
qy	do you work.
qy^d	and probably just got home.
sd	and I understand also they want men.
sd	my husband does.
b	Yes.
sd^t	but my husband in fact, he's been, probably has made a few more calls than I have because I tend to not make them around dinner time,
sd^t	but nobody's home.
ba	Well good.
 fc	it so much fun to talk to you.
fc	bye.
sd	and I have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home. up until, I guess, maybe about a year and a half ago,
sd	I got one for my son. a Macintosh L C.
sd	and he uses it for his school work.
b	Huh.
qw	Where you going to school?
bk	I see.
qy^d	In engineering?
bf	So that explains all the, computer assignments.
qy	Well, do you use your P C for things other than explicit computer work?
sv	and I really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for home computing.
sv	even the computer at work is primarily a, word processing system and a communication system.
sd	Emil probably pulls down a third of all my time.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	I did my Master's thesis on, a typewriter.
sd	I rented an I B M Selectric.
sd	And it was a pretty big deal.
sv	well, you know, it's just, it was just a completely different world then.
sd	I really don't use it myself.
sd	when I come home from work, I like to stay far away from computers and electronic things .
sv	and, of course, you know, there's an intellectual evolution taking place where,
sv	and the kids, they just take to it like candy.
qy	Do you have any children?
bf	You don't.
sd^e	I have, one. A five year old daughter.
sd	I stayed off work with her for little over of a year when she was born.
sd	And then I had her at a private sitter for, I guess, two, two and a half years after that.
sd	I couldn't have asked for anything better, I don't think.
sd	I didn't want to send her straight to a day care.
sd	And, even though she was that old, I still didn't want her to go to a day care.
sd	And this lady, you would think it was her own.
sd	She's real good.
sd	And, now I have got her in a Montessori school.
sd	And, actually, I've started working up there in the afternoons, too.
sd	she has to stay that much longer,
sd	they go year round, teach them.
sd	Now, in the summer they have like a lot of field trips.
sd	but they still go through all their, curriculum as usual.
sd	We kind of give her the third degree .
sd	So, that way I didn't think, {D y , you know, } the house would be, you know, cleaned or anything for me specifically.
sd	and we questioned her about what she fed them and, what she did with them during the day and, you know, just how she treated them, how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and , stuff like that .
sd	And, we really seem to be pleased with her.
sd	And she literally spent almost the entire amount that I paid her on my daughter. Either making her clothes or, buying her things.
sd	so she had to go, I guess, get a real job .
aa	Yeah.
sd	Well, I checked a lot of places out, you know, the Kinder Cares and the, stuff like that.
sd	and, even though it was older, it was real comfortable and, I guess, kind of homey.
sd	And I thought, well, gosh, that must be pretty good, you know, if everybody's trying to incorporate a little bit of it into, into,
sd	One place I think I didn't take her.
sd	And, I just kind of let her go, see what she felt like doing.
sd	So, I felt more comfortable at, that place.
 b	Yeah.
sd	it's hard to tell how much has been that or how much is just her.
sd	and she's already reading and writing and stuff, like that.
sd	And she just turned five last month.
sd	but, .
sd	I wanted, to quit my job so I could stay home with her the next five months, because I know she's going to have to face that .
 fe	And, my God. Here we go, you know.
qy	Do you have any nieces or nephews then ?
bh@	really? . Oh .
sv	Just easy to get them, there and stu ,
ba	Well, that's a shame.
sv	That's, scary.
sd	I was petrified.
sd	And that's why I don't mind paying more.
sd	I just feel m ,
sd	And that's one reason I like working up there a little bit is, because I know what's really going on.
sd	and, it's time to go .
sd	but I thought, well, you know, I'd like to see what she's doing, {D you, know } .
sd	But now that I'm there, I mean, it's a lot more convenient because there's so many kids that doddle. You know, when their parents come,
sd	and a lot of parents have places to go and and things like that.
sd	so, you know, now it doesn't bother me at all
qy^d	That one that's, set back in the woods?
b	Yeah.
sd^e	That's it.
b	Yeah.
sd	and that's something I like, too,
sd	because a lot of those places are , like, you know the one over here on seventy eight, Skaggs.
qy^d	That little Kinder Care, whatever it is?
sd	But it's set back, enough to,
sd	or or, if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could,
 +	you know, go, in and get one.
sd	And, that was one of the places I had checked out.
sd	and, of course, it was beautiful and, clean and smelled wonderful in there,
sd	I didn't base everything on that.
sv	and it's, over quick.
sd	I'm scared to death her going to public school.
sd	I do know why because you know, drugs and, everything else
sd	and, they talk about how soon they start that
sd	and that scares me.
sv	I mean, you're just with them,
sd	they've had police officers come in and talk to them about it.
sd	But, of course, they still have no concept of, what in the world drugs are, {D you, know }
 qy	Isn't that, sixth, sixth grade, you know,
sd	and that's a big gap.
sd	And that, I can honestly see the peer pressure there.
sd	And that, just, terrifies me to death. And stuff,
sd	and I'm probably a little too over protective
sv	but, Well, nowadays you have to be.
sd(^q)	I was going, God, how can you be so protective ? {D You, know }
sd	but, it's easy now .
aa	Definitely.
sd	and I do.
qy	Well, are you, are you, are you married ?
qy	Are y'all planning on having kids?
ba	Well, that's good.
sd	I don't think I agree with,
nn	No.
sd	but, maybe slowly changing my opinion.
sd	but I'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I certainly don't, advocate turning people like that loose.
sv	I'm not sure executing them, does anymore than keeping them in jail,
sv	that's a factor.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	and they they don't have a crime problem either.
sv	I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two.
sd	and that bothers me.
b	Huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh.
sv	I think it just becomes a, symbolic I'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians
sv	I would like for it to be settled once for all and, get in the background while the more important issues get discussed,
sd	Like I said, some years ago, I think I would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the, civilized western country.
sd	I, I wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and
sv	I'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and, that, costs and other factors justify, executing people.
sd	and, I can imagine that, for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case.
o	Okay.
sd	I like watching COLOMBO and, MATLOCK and QUANTUM LEAP,
ny	yeah.
ny	Uh huh.
ny	uh huh.
qo	What about,
ny	yeah.
sd	well I haven't seen either of those .
nn	Huh uh.
sd	but it's on so late here, that I don't always get to see it .
sd	So I haven't seen any of the movies, yet,
nn	No.
sd	I haven't seen really the new generation that much.
qr	Is there one you prefer better, the older one or the newer one?
 b	yeah.
sd	I mean, he almost hates the new ones .
sd	but, I don't .
b	Yeah.
sd	I like to watch COLOMBO because it's like a mystery thing.
sd	but COLOMBO is way tricky
sd	I mean he doesn't even try to let the person know he's getting onto them.
qy	Well, did you see the one.
sd	well we see it Thursdays at seven,
qy	did you hap ,
qy	did you see that?
bh	Really?
sd	I guess I haven't seen it before.
b	Yeah
sd	on the set or something.
sd	I like COLOMBO probably the best of any of those mystery things.
sv	But, there's never anything good on Saturdays, though .
sd	but I'm never home
b	Oh.
sd	They'll say, so and so from TWIN PEAKS, or something, you know.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	did they end the whole series?
bk	Oh.
b	Oh.
x	,
qw	What do you have ?
bh	yeah?
qw	What did you do, put it together?
b	Yeah.
qw	What do you use it for?
qw	What do you use it for?
qw	What kind of programs do you,
sd	I mean like business programs
 +	Man.
b	Uh huh,
sd	Matter of fact, I guess you get a lot of graphics in there, I imagine,
sd	That's where the speed helps out.
sd	that will, slow you up .
sd	Well, I do, programming for C N C turret presses and cat cam system type things
sd	I got a new line that I sell metal fabricating equipment, and cat cam systems, and tooling, et cetera.
qw	Who is that?
sd	I've tried to do is get this outfit to give me one .
sd	They not only give me a demonstrator, but the hardware as well as the software.
sd	And as they, And as they go to the next one I just keep the,
sd	that's why I have so many different levels of P C s around at the moment.
qy^d	A T S?
qw	And where are they at?
ny	yeah.
qy^d	In Richardson?
qy^g	that's about Lookout there, I think, isn't it.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
ba	Well, that's a good deal.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	you ever go by Lucky Computer there?
sd	when I was putting shop floor computers together for guys, I'd go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems.
 sd	So I don't know where those guys are at these days.
b	Yeah.
sd	I tell you, those prices have just, unbelievably come down.
b	Yeah.
sd	That wasn't alive for but maybe two years.
bh	That's it?
ba	I'll be darned.
o	Okay.
sd	and there's a couple of national parks, I guess, that you can camp at.
sd	I don't know if the camping that I've done is really roughing it without a whole lot of stuff.
sd	and there's some real nice ones in Arkansas.
sv	I think Arkansas has one of the best parks departments around.
sd^e	part of them are.
sd	there's a golf course and, just a whole bunch of camping sites.
qw	where have you,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	The more times we did it, the more serious we get about it.
qw	where is Raleigh, in North Carolina?
qy	Are you kind of away from the Blue Ridge Mountains,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	but I didn't know how much camping areas there were along there.
sv	that seems, like a challenge.
 b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	Are the temperatures real extreme there
b	Uh huh.
 ba	true.
b	Yeah.
sd	I don't know when I'm going to get a chance to do that
sd	when you're close to a big city like Dallas, the lights kind of wash, wash off the star
sd	It's just amazing, how much you miss.
sv^t	Well, I guess we've talked as much as we need to on the subject.
fc	it was good talking to you Robert .
qy	Well, do you own a P C?
ba	wow.
qw	What processor does it have in it?
qw	what kind of work do you do on it?
b	Yeah.
sd	but I've, yeah, I work for T I
sd	It's an S P one thousand which, it has a fast processor in it, a three eighty six.
sd	I do a lot of training of our customers for new products.
sd	so it's, it's kind of fun,
sd	but I just haven't got around to doing it yet.
qw	Your husband, what group is your husband in?
qy^d	Defense systems and electronics group?
b	Yeah.
sd	I work on, printers and, the peripheral products division, basically,
sd	I work in the airline, marketing group.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	Is he a programmer?
bk	I see.
b	Right.
b	Right.
qy	Does he bring a little one home with him
b	Uh huh.
sd	we build, laptop and notebook computers here in Temple also.
sd	I mean, they, they have modems in them, you can send a fax from your P C,
br	What's that?
sd	just, you know,
 +	plug in the phone to your computer and dial in
sd	I just found out I'm going to Denver Sunday night again.
sd	but, it's really not enough to become a big hassle.
b	I see.
sd	depends on what you consider expensive,
sd	you can get real high powered stuff now for under two thousand dollars, where, you know, just a few years ago it would have been six, seven, eight, nine thousand dollars.
sv	you know, two thousand dollars isn't just pocket change to a lot of people .
sd	when I started at, T I, I was a Summer development student, and finishing up at school
sd	I mean, it was nice having access to the, equipment to,
b	Yeah.
qw	Well, how many different types of packages do you use?
b	Uh huh.
sd	up at work anyway, I use WordPerfect and Lotus and, and which is, a line draw package.
sv	You probably use or something like that, for your, data entry stuff that your, talking about.
qy	do you work at home all the time
b	Uh huh.
sv	that was, that worked out pretty good then.
b	Yeah.
qy^g	So, it keeps you in the company,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I tell you if I could bring a computer home and do stuff here, I'd get all kinds of stuff done.
sd	Phone's always ringing
sd	and I've got lots of documentation I need to review and some I need to revise.
sd^e	but, you know, I need to be at the office, too.
sd	but, a P C at the house would really take a lot of the load off.
sd	well, I've done that before on, a couple times.
sd	instead of bringing home a computer, you just bring home a few floppy disks, you know.
ba	my.
ba	Man that sounds really nice.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've got a lot of folks that I've worked with like that as well.
fc	well, we'll talk to you later.
sd	well, I can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows
sd	one of them is QUANTUM LEAP
sd	and, it's adventure and things like that
sd	but that's the way it is,
b	Uh huh.
sd	He is .
ba	that's right,
sd	in fact, there was one show that he even turned down a date with some, you know, beautiful woman just because the idea that his mind was on the ozone layer and, you know, global warming and all this other kind of stuff.
sd	so that was part of, I guess, his character building or whatever,
sv	Which of course he needed .
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's a good point,
qw	So what do you consider your favorite shows?
b	Okay.
^2	Dede,
aa	I agree.
sd	I can't remember what her name is,
sd	Well, but, see I read an article in T V GUIDE about, about HUNTER, and about you know, his three girls, whatever you want to call them
sd	and they say that, that there was like a conflict between her and him, that they never really could get her into, any character that they could use.
sd^e	the second one the blond
sd	you know, if you think about it, they didn't really interact hardly at all
sd	I mean, they were never partners.
b	Yeah.
sv	but, it seemed like it was almost two different organizations you know,
sv	and, you know, you're wondering, you know, well when did this happen?
sv	I kind of agree with that.
sv	Well, I'm afraid that's what they really wanted to do,
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, see, there was that spark between Dede and Hunter for a while
sv	And that really made it a very interesting, show to where you never really knew which one was going to show up. You know, whether it was going to, where they're going to be real close or whether they're just going to be partners, you know
sv	and you always wonder, why they don't, you know, get together or whatever.
sv	And so I guess that's what they decide to do
sv	But it's always been a formula, for T V that the two main stars get married, that the show ends up, you know, dying.
sd	They had GET SMART for, ten hours a day, from seven o'clock at night, until six or until five o'clock the next morning. All the GET SMART episodes you could ever see.
sd	Well, the last day, all they did was the last season, to where the two of them got married
sd	the series died right after that, because,
ad	well go ahead.
sv	same thing.
sv	it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things they, before they get married
 +	and, well, of course, another one of their mistakes, I think, is they have a tendency to change characters, or to change the characters', personalities
 +	well, especially after they get married.
sd	couple of examples would be, well, like I said, this one about or Get Well Smart, the female character, Barbara Feldon
sd	Well, in short, whenever they got married, she got dingy.
bh	You know, why would they do that?
sv	It made no sense.
ba	Unfortunately, that's probably true.
sd	that's on Tuesday nights I think.
sd	well, I I hardly ever watch it,
sd	and then they pulled them apart
sv	and I think they're thinking about that exact thing, about the idea that if the show lets them, get together, then you lose part of what the show's all about.
sd	So. I always thought that was kind of weird.
b	right.
qy	Do you think that's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages secret, or at least they keep it quiet.
sd	Now I don't particularly like either one of them
sv	but, their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together
sd	or at least, that's the way I look at it.
 h	So I don't know,
sd^e	I would think so.
sv	they wouldn't be easy.
ba	So, well that's kind of interesting.
qy^g	So, well I guess that's about all we need to do, isn't it.
fc	I really appreciate it.
sd^t	you're the second female I've talked to.
sd	it's kind of nice .
fw	Uh huh.
fa	sorry.
sd	It's got three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the other.
sd	it's big.
fa	I'm sorry
sd	It's big enough for us, though.
sd	We've got two children.
sd	see, that's north.
sd	so it's north to me .
sd	I'm really from Kentucky.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	okay.
^2	that dialect.
b	Uh huh.
qw	How many kids do you have?
qy	Do you have enough bedroom space, then?
b	Uh huh.
sd	it's more or less a spare room.
sd	We rarely go in there, except for to play chess.
sd	the living room and kitchen are huge,
sd	Where you've got to leave the furniture just one certain way, you can't rearrange it at all.
b	Yeah.
sd	we've got two great big windows in our back bathroom.
sd	No privacy.
sd	Well, we've got at least two windows on every wall in the house.
sd	I really would.
sd	You must live in an older home too then.
b	Uh huh.
sd	When we moved in the man that sold it to us had said that he remodeled it,
sd	so most of that, by now, is falling apart.
sd	and I don't like that at all.
sd	With that, the great big square tiles like, that you put on the floor, the huge one.
sd	for that you put,
sd	that would be prettier.
sd	It just doesn't look good.
sd	and it's shorting out here and there,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	We've got our stereo hooked up.
sd	it's always ran just fine, the clock and stuff.
sd	But on the east side of the house it runs fine.
sd	it's all new wiring up in the attic, or I guess crawl space,
sd	he really should have hired people.
sv	he'll end up killing himself.
sv^r	End up killing theirselves.
sd	but that's about as far as he'll go.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	husband probably knows.
sd	Like I said, he didn't know what he was doing.
b	Uh huh.
ba	no.
^2	And, a house full of snow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	no.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	my husband was in the Army.
sd	and it was coming out of the lights, fixtures.
 sd	It shorted it out, or something.
sd	So she woke up with about six feet of water in her house.
sd	not six feet
qy	so. Did you have carpets and stuff?
b	Uh huh.
sd	Your house sounds like mine because mine's pier and beam too.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well you got to redo it the way you wanted it in the end.
qy	Are you finished with it now?
ny	Uh huh.
 qw	how long have you lived there?
qy	You all did it yourselves?
no	The home improvements.
b	Uh huh.
qy	do you have .
ny	Yeah.
o	There, okay.
qy	do you have children?
bk	okay.
sd	I have three.
qy	do you work?
 bk	Okay.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	no kidding.
b	Really.
 b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
 %	Because there's,
ny	Yeah.
^2	It's like a family thing.
b	Yeah.
ba	good.
sd	but obviously you do or you wouldn't have him there, I know,
b	Uh huh.
ba	gosh.
b	Right.
^2	Wasn't the same.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	Good.
ba	good.
ba	that's good.
sd	My oldest one is ten and a half now, or she's, I guess,
sd	and I couldn't wait to have them it would be kind of silly, you know, to go back to work as soon as I had them,
sd	By the end of the ten years I was really ready , to go back to work,
sd	and my youngest was only, two and a half .
sd	I mean she was already two and a half,
sd	so you know, she wasn't an infant.
aa	Yeah.
sd	and I'm working part time .
sd	but I only have half time salary,
sd	and, when school lets out, I just don't, I haven't, I have no idea what I'm going to do, because I certainly can't afford what we did last year which was,
sd	but it was all, really expensive .
sd	if I can work part of the day, you know, I'm going to leave them home.
b	Right.
sd	But, the four year old now I have had her since I went back to work, or before I went back to work really, in a home day care situation,
sd	it took us two or three different people to find,
aa	Yeah.
sd	But, I wasn't embarrassed to shop around you know,
sd	there's an association here in town of professional home, care providers or something like that.
sd	In Plano.
sd	care provider.
sd	She goes to seminars
sd	and, so it's just really, really well regulated.
sd	After noon classes she's going to be here because she's going to morning kindergarten.
sd	and, we put him in Amrein's Day Care, after. After,
sd	but the thing is he was in school all day, in second grade,
sd	in Plano, it's open classroom situation where they don't have walls,
sd	so there is like a hundred and twenty second graders , in the same area with no walls.
sd	and then there would be a whole ton of other kids, all in the same room, you know,
sd	But, it was just like going to school until five thirty at night instead of being able to get home at two thirty.
aa	Yeah.
sd	Because he was always around with a crowd of kids he just really missed being able to be by himself, and having some peace and quiet
b	Yes.
sd	but we tried to sign him up for after school scouts and, stuff like that
b	Yeah.
b	Right .
aa	It is.
aa	It is.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	You're kidding.
ba	You're kidding.
 ba	that's great.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's so good.
b	Uh huh.
^2	He's out of there.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Good.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my gosh.
ba	No kidding.
sd	She knows something right, that she
sv	that makes such a difference.
sd	That's the way it is at my daughter's nursery school too.
sv	And I think that really makes a difference.
sd	They're in it because it's a profession, not because it's a job they could get because they didn't qualify for anything else, you know .
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ba	that's great, you know.
 ^2	Sometimes it isn't.
qy	Well, is it real expensive then?
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Galen just doesn't go there three mornings a week.
sd	when school holidays come around, I used to have such a problem with that.
ad^t	do you want to go first?
sd^t	Fitness and exercise.
sd	so I had to kind of change my life style a little bit .
sd	Thirty eight.
sd	it's just that left knee that just doesn't want to do everything it used to.
bh	Really?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's right.
ba	That's right.
sv	and you probably do.
ba	This is true.
qy	Have you tried the pool at the Spring Creek Fitness Center?
ny	Yes.
sd	They keep it at eighty one degrees year round.
sd	I try to beat the traffic in the mornings when I workout in the mornings, I try to come down to the Dallas Fitness Center.
ad	You need to put that on there, seriously.
bh	you don't?
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	This is true.
b	Yeah.
qw	Now what year are we talking about?
sd	things have become much more enlightened since then.
sd	but people are more sympathetic to it.
aa^r	Yes.
ba	My gosh.
ad^c	Could you hold the phone for one second,
sd	I'm back.
ba	Wow.
sv	Of course it's real easy to take care of the first one when you're on your back.
b	Really.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	really.
b	Yeah.
ba	There you go.
sd	I can believe that.
sv	flex time is great.
fc	Well, it's been good talking with you.
sd	shoot it's only about ten bucks a month.
sd	it's no big deal.
ny	Yeah.
na	but I mean to use any of the facilities is no extra charge.
sd	it is.
^2	or a dependent of one.
b	Really.
ba	Wonderful.
b	Yeah.
sd	it's great.
sd	it's not excessively crowded on the weekends.
sd	If you're in Richardson you'd probably wanted to come to the Dallas site.
sd	well, then you could go either one,
sd	and you'd probably like the pool there.
sd	I'm glad.
fc	Well, thank you.
fc	You have a good day.
sd	well we just finished watching, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES on tape, you know .
ny^r	yeah.
qy	have you seen it?
b	Yeah,
sv	but, you know, I didn't think it was as good as all the, hype was about it.
sv	I couldn't see it worth getting a nomination for, best picture.
ny^r	yeah,
no	you know, it depends on wh ,
sd	Because I've never seen CITIZEN KANE,
sd	and I've never seen CASABLANCA and never seen GONE WITH THE WIND.
b	Uh huh.
sd	we saw part of THE AFRICAN QUEEN on T V a couple of years ago,
sd(^q)	and we're like well why don't we go see this now ,
sd	one of the movies we saw recently, we saw, MISERY.
sv	That was good,
sd	and there's one really bad scene where I mean, there's not blood but it's pretty graphic .
sv	But it's a really good movie,
ny^r	yeah,
sd	and she's also , a little on the nutso side.
sd^e	we haven't,
bh	it wasn't?
sd	I heard like mixed reviews, of that,
sd	that's on our list of things to see .
sd	I think it's like six bucks now in the theaters,
sd	and then a lot of other stuff we just wait until it comes out on tape.
sd	well one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.
qy	have you seen that?
sv	it was great .
sv	it was,
sd	I like the director a lot, a guy named Tim Burton.
qy	Did you ever see the movie BEETLEJUICE?
sv	if you didn't like BEETLEJUICE you'll probably won't like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.
sd	and, I liked those two movies of his a lot.
sd	He did BATMAN also, which, you know .
aa	It was good,
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	but, I'm a big baseball fan
sd	so, you know, after BULL DURHAM and FIELD OF DREAMS, you know,
qw	Which one?
sd	NO WAY OUT was really good
qy	did you ever see SILVERADO?
sd	John Kreas is in it if you don't blink.
sd	and it was one of those ones that could have been four hours if they hadn't cut a lot out.
sv	but it was really good .
b	Uh huh.
qy	is that any good?
bk	okay.
sd	You know the people who run the video store was recommending it to somebody else.
qy	you said you seen NO WAY OUT?
sd	he was in THE UNTOUCHABLES, too.
b	Yeah,
sd^e	it was on one of the networks, I think last weekend. or two weeks ago.
sd	and, you know, I saw part of it again.
sd	but I've really enjoyed him in everything I've seen him in, a guy named Charles Martin Smith.
qy	did you ever see AMERICAN GRAFFITI?
qy	Did you ever see the movie STAR MAN.
sd	in STAR MAN, he was the guy chasing after, Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen, or Nancy Allen.
sd	short nerdy guy with glasses.
sd	He was the accountant .
b	Yeah.
sd	but he's not .
 b	Yeah.
 b	Yeah.
sd	a review usually won't make me go see a movie I hadn't already wanted to see.
sd	I want to see it.
sd	but my girlfriend's seen part one and part two although she saw them years ago,
sd	so, we're probably going to like rent those some time and then try to see GODFATHER PART THREE somewhere.
b	Yeah.
sd	I haven't, never read it.
sd	And Brando like does a parody of the character he played in THE GODFATHER.
sd	and then he's running into Marlon Brando who is playing, you know, you know this, organized crime head.
sv	So, it was, it was a fun movie.
sd	I thought it was interesting that he was doing som ,
sd	being from Baltimore, of course, I'm a big Barry Levinson fan since, he's, you know, he's done a bunch of Baltimore movies.
sd	Barry Levinson did, DINER and TINMAN, and AVALON which are all set in Baltimore.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but DINER is really worth seeing.
ny	yeah.
b	Okay
sd	well, I, I guess if I was having a dinner party depending on the number of people, I might cook like a brisket or a roast or maybe a chicken dish
sd	and we usually serve fresh fruit and, then make a dessert.
ba	Well, that sounds good.
 ba^r	That sounds good.
qy	Bread, do you have bread to go with it?
ba	Gosh.
sv	well, lasagna's always wonderful for large crowds.
sd	they've told me that they go to Sam's and buy a great big pan of lasagna.
bh	Did you?
sd	and they say, gosh, if you have company coming when you don't want to be always in the kitchen, it's easy,
sd	and they said it's good.
ba	So, that, always sounds good to me,
sd	I feel like I'm in the kitchen cooking a lot.
sd	guess I cook a, seems like I cook a lot of dinners, not always for company, just for family.
sd	So, feels like I'm often in the kitchen.
b^r	right,
sd^r	I don't know what that is.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
qy	Do you like to make your own guacamole?
sd	we don't make it very often, I guess,
ba	Gosh,
 ba	Gosh,
sd	or it's always good on top of something in the sandwich.
sd	and everyone there said they never made guacamole salad.
sv	I guess they don't have it at home,
sd	So I was concerned that, taking this, you know, taking this as a dip, I thought, gosh, you know, sometimes when we have it at home it, it turns dark on the top so quickly,
qy	does that help?
b	Okay,
sd	and it really stayed longer than I ever thought it would,
sd	I thought maybe that was the trick.
sd	we've been buying turkey lately, instead of beef,
sd	everybody seems to like it.
sd	so we often buy it
sd	we buy it,
sd	and I don't think anybody in my house knows the difference, unless you tell them.
b^r	yeah.
sv^t	Well, I guess that's probably all we need to do for tonight.
sd	I always like dessert .
b^r	right
sd	and we take a recipe from my grandmother, you know
sd	I really a , am concerned that, so many of these child care places are coming under, you know, investigation for, you know, child molestation.
sd	and why, why would they be interested in your little turnip unless, you know, one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well that's somebody to molest, you know.
sd	and so we really didn't have that much exposure to it.
b	Huh.
b	Huh.
ba	well that's interesting.
sv	Well you must have just one hero ace professional job to support something like that.
ba	well, yeah .
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm an engineer.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Five hundred dollars a week. For two kids.
sv	That's incredible.
 b	Yeah.
sv	and you know, that's a good starting wage
sv	but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care.
b	Huh.
sd	But mine are twenty two, twenty three and twenty seven
qy^d	I guess baby sitters now are up at, what, five dollars an hour?
ba	my.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Right.
sd	They make it really easy for people to get credit cards, especially college students.
sd	But they both have a lot of credit cards.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And that's how a lot of people get into trouble.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	I've, I've paid off about four credit cards this year.
sd	And especially the Visa Card that you can go and get cash on .
sd	And it seems like every time I'm short of cash, I just go get it from Visa.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Or if they've sent you a number that you can use. You know, a personal identification number that you can use in the, impact machines or whatever, you, you can do that.
sd	You know, sometimes you have to ask them for that.
sd	And then I have one that, just gave me the pin number automatically.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ba	wow! .
sd	ev , everybody in the world will offer you a credit card.
b	Uh huh.
sd	that's why I've really started to try to pay off mine and get out of debt. Because we never know when we might, you know, get laid off or something.
sd	and they've had a lot of, you know, layoffs lately.
bh	You do?
qw	Where are you?
sd	I know they're selling out somebody in Colorado Springs.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I have worked on a part time job, where I was a collector. For, a jewelry company .
sd	I mean they have about a thousand collectors, I guess.
sd	And, there's just so many people that have bought jewelry, which is really a luxury item
sd	but they got it for a friend
sd	and then the friend wouldn't pay them.
sd	and you really have to watch this you know.
sd	Because every month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau, you know. Automatically, most of them do.
sd	bad because if you know, your bill is due on the fifteenth
 +	then y , y , you , you're not past due until the fifteenth of the next month.
sd	you're thirty days late.
aa	Right,
b	right.
sd	and, anyway, we need to watch our credit reports and all that kind of,
sd	I believe it costs about ten dollars.
sd	and you're thirty days is not real bad though anyway. If you've got a charge off on your credit report or something like that.
sd	Or something you haven't paid in sixty days or ninety days, you know. And things like that .
 b	Uh huh.
qy	Do they charge a lot of interest on that card?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah .
sd	and I hadn't read the, terms of the credit agreement really.
sd	and it was like twenty three percent interest.
sd	And that's the one bill that I hurried and paid up.
sd	And, and I've always watched it since then.
sd	You really have to watch those interest rates.
sd	But there are a couple of states that can.
sd	And one to watch out for is anybody that bills you out of Atlanta, Georgia.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
o	Okay .
sd	But I'm glad you're a stranger.
qw	What do you do?
bh	Really?
sd	Maybe they're going to arrest us both.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	and every time I spent money, I mean cash mostly, I would, write it down so I could see at the end of a month how much I spent on food so I could do better planning.
sd	I certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	it was nineteen years old.
sd	It isn't like I couldn't afford one.
sd	but for me, I only do that every week or, I mean, maybe once a month.
sv	To me, I realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that.
sv	And so if you're extravagant on how you buy food, it doesn't add up. I mean if you're not going to super expensive restaurants, which I don't care to go to.
qy	Do you all have a budget?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	We just scramble through month to month, you know.
sd	we have a two income family.
sd	She also works
sd	I'm pretty bad about procrastinating
sd	and one of these days I am going to do something about that I believe .
sd	She, she writes all the checks, you know, once a month.
sd^e	She's, an annuity administrator
sd	and so she works for an insurance company.
sd	She likes keeping track of all that stuff
sd^e	sort of.
sd	We try to keep our retirement and our savings kind of automated
sd	Just like taken directly.
aa	Yeah.
sv	because if you don't see it, you don't miss it .
sd	You don't spend it.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bf	Just kind of play it by ear, but keep the deductions you know .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	about five years.
sd^e	She's like, nineteen months.
sd	So, she's not,
sd	Not too bad.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I, I work for, I'm an electronic technician.
sd	I work for a university. Georgia Tech, research
b	well .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	My grandfather is ninety two years old.
sd	He lives in a little farmhouse on a farm.
sd	but he just really doesn't want to go to a nursing home.
sd	He has arthritis.
sd	And I have one aunt that really looks after him a lot.
sd	But, my great grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three.
sd	And, died six weeks after they put him in the home.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	But I just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	But I think a lot of nursing homes really, are guilty of neglect.
b	Uh huh.
qo	or, or what do you think?
sd	and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire, the money will be there for us.
sv	and you know, as far as return investment, that's nothing
sd	and they just haven't yet.
b	Uh huh.
sd	it's like seventy five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically
sd	that histor , for some reason, historical sites with, you know, the full federal money and everything seem to appear as almost as like political favors to very strong politicians.
b	Uh huh.
bf	So, it sounds like you think that we'd be able to save some money by, passing the line item veto.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Pork barrel politics.
sv	but Massachusetts when Dukakis was there, anyway, wasn't in that great shape financially.
h	I mean, I don't know,
sv	or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and whatnot.
sd	and it became so onerous that we gave up on it .
sd	and I only update that, I don't know, maybe once every quarter or so. Every three months. Just, basically when the statements come in. You know. Just to see whether or not we're you know, getting ahead, falling behind or staying even or what.
sd	that's really about, you know, the extent of the kind of, financial score keeping that we're doing.
by	Oh dear, that's terrible.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
qy	Are you living with, with people that you're sharing expenses?
b	uh huh.
ba	Oh dear.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
b	sure.
b	Uh huh.
sd	my next door neighbor just lost his job. In you know, one of these,
sd	I don't know what a shoe company's doing running a computer company.
sd	they took the top management and gave them jobs with the corporate, at the corporate front office
sd	and everybody else was sent packing.
sd	I've got
sv	but at the present stage, you probably are even more in the market for a budgetary thing than most people probably might be. In terms of keeping score of input and output.
qy	do you have a computer at home
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
b^m	Okay.
na	That's right.
sv	I think that's what the subject is about.
qy^d^h	In the MORNING TIMES?
sd	I guess I did not.
sv	Well, it's been interesting that we,
sv	So we live in a society, though, where everyone if you ask them on polls, will, say that they think that everyone has a right to health care.
sv	And yet, I don't think we've ever quite decided who's really supposed to pay for it.
sv	we ought to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that's more fair.
qy	You have health insurance?
qy^d	Through your company?
ba	my goodness.
qo	How was your care at Parkland?
sd	But, yet, Parkland is not free, either.
sv	So you did have a good experience.
qy	Is your wife better, I hope?
by	I'm real sorry.
b*	Sure. / * listen; is this a question?
sv	but it's very sad.
sd	Actually, I'm a pediatrician
sd	and I feel very strongly about, children, and, developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year. Where we certainly proved that we're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most.
sv	but, I strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization, glasses, hearing aids , basic health benefits.
sv	that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily, et cetera.
sd	Thirty one percent of all Texas children do not have insurance and are not on Medicaid.
sd	and it's pretty overwhelming to me.
qy^d	I don't know if you are familiar with that.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then, well, not bother to total it
sv	So it really helps with that.
b	Uh huh.
sd	so we needed to start doing more of that just for, you know, saving for college and things like that.
sd	We try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that.
b	Uh huh.
sv	so it's a lot more interesting trying to,
sd	You know, kind of enforce the savings.
sv	But, it will be interesting to see .
qw	But, I was just curious, what, part of the country.
bk	okay.
sv	but well that's interesting.
qrr	or was there another?
sd	that is how I got it as well
b	Uh huh.
sd^t	so, well, I guess we're talking about the experiment.
sv	but, it's hard to talk about finances without getting to, dollar figures I guess you know,
co	we could talk about some of the long range goals
sd	well I think, either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point
sv	It seems like every year my employer just gives back, you know, a little bit your tuition reimbursement.
qy	So, do your privacy being invaded at any time?
b	Right.
^q	You going to say you don't want to sell me this product then that's fine.
sd	But, really it's part of this compliance thing.
sd	I know that certain states actually sell their lists like, motor vehicles.
sd	You have to do that.
sd	And nowhere does it asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone.
sd	and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody. You know,
sv	I don't think they have the right to do that.
sv	Whenever you donate money to someone?
sv	and you start getting millions of calls or solicitations.
sv	it kind of makes you feel from doing it again.
sd	Like, National Public Radio or any of the public, stations, you know.
sd	I, I, I think I sent in money f , once to public, T V.
sd	and it just started soon after I had done that one.
sd	and that's also happened to me where I've given money to my old Alma Mater in college.
sd	the people do these phonathons
ad	And, you know, like hold on here.
sv	There's no need for someone who is soliciting should know at all.
sv	and that was very offensive too.
sv	I think that, one, advantage of having, the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't, convict someone who, really shouldn't be convicted.
sv	I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way, that, you, would have a problem, you know, that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted.
qy	Have you ever served on a jury before?
bk	okay.
qw	what sorts of cases were they?
qr	So were they criminal or civil?
qy	did the jury have trouble reaching a decision?
b	Yeah.
qy	So did it become?
b	Yeah.
qy^d	You just needed a majority?
qy^d	That was also civil?
b	Yeah.
sd	so I haven't been, you know, a jury eligible age for very long
sd	but I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student, because it was, a very bad time.
sv	but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well.
qy^d	you thought it turned out pretty well?
b	Yeah.
qy^d	someone had to figure out what was going on?
qy	I mean, did a couple of people sort of gradually, sort of assume, sort of a moderator role in the trial
qy^d	So it did end up working out pretty well?
sv	The one thing I sometimes wonder about, in civil cases is, whether, especially sort of in, maybe like product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes
sv	and I wonder if there's really, if the system works adequately in educating the jurors about, whatever, you know, issue is under discussion.
sd	in the case you were involved in, you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind.
b	Yeah.
bf	and he hadn't made the payments.
b	Yeah.
bf	so they were suing to get it back.
b	Yeah.
sd	My daughter that's seventeen now I worked even when she was a baby.
sd	and then I was really lucky to have put them in a, Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist, right off of Walnut Hill and Preston.
sd	I just wish all kids, if they have to be put in day school, could have that kind of place .
sd	So, it worked well.
qo	How about you?
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	So many of the churches have really strong preschool and children's day out
sd	I just couldn't hack it.
sd	So there was real continuity.
sd	and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there.
sd	and she just kept good people and real cheerful place, lots of arts and crafts,
sd	and I'm really glad my kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that. That if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and you know, I willingly did it
sv	This is something that ought to be in the schools rather than some of the other stuff they do.
sv	And parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that.
sv	So, in some ways I think the day schools do serve those purposes.
bf	Put the colors away .
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd^e	both times they were at our house.
sd	and I'd practically give my paycheck away to do it,
sd	the first one was an, elderly lady who was putting a daughter through nursing school just purely on baby sitting money.
sd	And she kept Cheryl during the day and then did more baby sitting at night.
sd	And she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had because both our parents are dead.
sd	So that was a plus from that respect as well.
sd	And then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her.
sv	I just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	and our benefits for maternal and parental care and even for elderly people are really expanding.
sd	with being able to take off full time longer you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full time for up to six months.
sd	or they've, you know, whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint.
sd(^q)	And that helps because you don't have to just wean yourself cold turkey and say okay, I never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again.
sd	of course it's too late for me so I've not tried them to see how effective they are
sv	but I think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast .
sd	And for our age group it's too late, too little, too late.
sv	But I do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work.
sv	Two income families I think are here to stay.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs that they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces .
sv	It seems to help the new mothers not have to come back full time.
sv	because that's hard.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	from the time she started first grade, I wanted her out in Plano area.
sd	and they'd move.
sd	She ended up being in a different home every year.
sd	And I finally decided I didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move.
qy	All right, have you lived in this area long?
bk	Okay.
sv	I mean by mid February, I mean, we start getting a lot of rain.
b	Uh huh.
sd	my wife and I we used to live in San Antonio, couple years ago,
sd	it was so much ice that came down, later on that afternoon and evening,
sv	it was horrible.
b	Yeah.
sd	I guess I'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather.
sd	I mean, I would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly
sv	it's just not very comfortable,
sd^e	a little bit.
b	Yeah.
sd	and the air conditioning went out on the car ,
sv	and, you, you just get used to air conditioning all the time,
sd	and it was just killing us.
b	Yeah.
sd	well, I mean, I, I guess I've been in some places, you know, where the weather was just so mild, you know, places like Monterey, California or, you know,
sv	you know you're sweating,
sd	it's so hot, you just feel it pulling away, bizarre.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	they said talk about the Middle East situ , well,
sv	I mean you can only talk about the situation just so long.
fc	Okay.
sd	we're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing.
sd	So, I'm looking for something, littler bigger,
sd	and, we're looking at, some just four door, five passenger sedans as well.
sd	I don't really have a preference either way I guess. You know,
sd	but I haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones I've had.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I mean, e , even if it's just details, it seems like, they, you know,
sd	It's clearly just a design problem there.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	like a Miata or something like that?
ba	Interesting.
sv	I guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because I look for, you know, size and safety, and then mileage.
sd	I think in terms of computer terminology, I look at, you know, price performance and things like that. And then a little bit at life expectancy, I guess,
sv	but it, you know depends on what you pay initially.
sd	But, you know I've got a hundred and twenty five thousand miles on the Charger.
sd	Actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage
sd	and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton.
sd	but the other ninety four thousand have been just fine , with it,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	but I think they're obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to G M after they've used it for six months and put you know, twelve or fifteen thousand miles, on it
sd	and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you,
sd	I mean, well, ninety two's, granted, but the new ones, you know
sd	fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot,
sd	and, the dealer comes out okay you know,
h	and , So, but, I don't know,
sd	we can get like a Caravan at twelve, five
qw	what's our topic?
sd^m	Taxes.
b^r	Right.
sv	I mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	sure.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	and, one of my parents is still claiming me.
aa	I'm sure .
sd	but I didn't make enough money to really make, too much of a difference.
aa	Right.
sd^e	I haven't.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
b^r	Uh huh.
ba	sure.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
sd	So, I haven't made use of that.
sd	Physics.
aa	Uh huh.
sd	Everybody says that .
sd	so I guess you could call it more straight stuff than applied.
qy	are, is America, I mean are we pretty steep compared to most countries?
sd	I don't think so either.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
o	Anyway, .
sd	I, it's called living within your means . You know, which means at the moment, paying off the VISA bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car doesn't collapse .
sd	and then it goes through the moon,
qw	so what do yo ,
qy^d	So you can afford to get a house?
b	Yeah.
qw	So, what do you and your husband do?
bh	Are you really?
ba	No kidding.
qw	Overseas, where would you be going?
b	Really.
qw	How long would you be there?
qw	with what Church?
sd	they have an office, in Costa Mesa as I recall.
qy	So, are you, active in translation?
b	Uh huh .
qw	So, what, what languages do you speak besides English, of course?
b	Uh huh .
^2	In France.
sv	seems to be a lot of controversy about that .
sv	but I lean towards, if it's premeditated or if it's, kind of a habitual or a tendency that people, may get into, then I guess I don't really have a problem with it .
sv	and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months. .
aa	No.
b	Right.
sv	And you can, probably spend, a lot of time, or maybe eventually, just waiting it out,
sv	and that's where a lot of aggravation comes, I think, is, these guys spend so much time in the appeal process or just in the waiting process,
sd	and, you know, the last I heard it was costing ten, twenty, thirty thousand dollars a year, to keep these guys waiting.
b	Yeah.
bf	It sort of takes the justice out of the justice system.
^2	It should be over and done with.
sv	And she winds up being a victim, day after day after day.
b	Right.
bf	She, She's an emotional victim .
sv	And, you know, like you say, the cops that are out doing the work , day by day have got to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work, basically go out the window.
qy^d	so unless you've got something else, well,
fc	It's a pleasure talking with you.
fc	good bye.
sd	I'm back on.
qy	you say you watch evenings mostly?
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when you're not going to be there?
qw	Which ones?
b	Oh.
sd	Well, one they're taking, off.
sd	we like L A LAW.
sd^r	We like, that.
sd	I'm sorry they're breaking the team up, because we liked all the ones that were on there.
sd	I'm not sure I like the new ones too much.
sv	it looks like, it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things. Where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show.
sd	Alan Alda did it on MASH.
qy	So do you mostly like like a story type of thing that lasts an hour?
^2	In one hour, like QUANTUM LEAP.
sd	That's one of our favorites .
sd	which they do at the beginning of the season, to grab your attention. You know,
sv	that's always a bummer too.
sv	Sometimes it's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one.
sd	I, I'll, mostly I'm into it for relaxation,
sd	That type of show is what we what, we watch.
qy	Have you seen that?
sd	but it's like dummies and things, that are used,
sd	But there's always a moral to each story.
sd	but, the son in laws get to throw the mother in laws when they're seventy five over a cliff .
sd	and then when it comes time for him to throw her over, well, the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her.
sv	it's real funny that they give the teenagers as the one that questions, what's going on.
sd	And so, in the end he doesn't throw her over,
sd	they call it the night of the howling, or something like that,
sd	he thought it was not ...
sd	so all the people that worked with the father ostracized him .
sd	and there's always, like I say, a moral to it
sd	Well, half hour.
sd	that's all there is to it.
sd	it, they, they're trying to liken the father in there of the teenage son to like JACKIE GLEASON SHOW. the way he talks to his mother in law and so forth,
sd	and, I guess mostly I like the news shows too, the news magazines, like SIXTY MINUTES or TWENTY, TWENTY or PRIME TIME LIVE or something like that, you know, all of those shows, if I can do it,
sd	but my husband likes to watch, old movies, especially war movies, or, sports, which I'm not,
sd	and I like, gymnastics, and some track and field,
sd	and I just don't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing.
sd	or, you know, I always have, letter writing,
sv	that's something that comes from your old age, you know.
^q	Idle hands are the devil's workshop .
b	No.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	We don't watch it unless they're here .
sv	That's something I didn't think that we'd ever do .
sd	he's, he wouldn't let us pull it,
ad^t	Push my number.
sd	but I don't actually play golf.
bf	Hack it all over the place?
qy^g	It's sickening, isn't it?
qy^d	I guess that's a good question?
b	Yeah.
sd	I like that too.
sd	and then I got worse again
b	Yeah.
ba	That's pretty good.
sd	I'm going to do it right, and see if I can actually play this game or not.
sv	and I think I'm doing all fine
b	Yeah.
qy	Can you really see it though?
qw	What about the speed?
qy	no , but can you tell how fast you're going to hit it?
qy	but you can feel that?
sd	Now I'm T V watching.
sd	They make you die at the hole every time.
sd	it's hard for me.
bf	Once you're there, you're all set though.
ad	and you put it in.
sd	And me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in.
ba	That's good.
bf	Joe Pros?
qy^d	For eighteen?
sv	that's pretty good.
sv	Your shitty golf is probably the best golf I've ever seen.
sd	but it ain't going to happen.
ad^t	Well why don't you start cause it said I was suppose to ask you what do you,
sd^e	I do.
ba	my gosh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	It was getting where she was getting dangerous. I mean letting strangers in and things like this,
sd	and then } she's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time
sd	but she has adjusted beautifully.
sd	I'd be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado.
sd	and doctor's are available if they need them.
sv	Of course, I guess all nursing homes there is
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	so that's what would happen.
sv	It's unfortunate.
sd	and I don't know how our kids are going to take care of us. You know.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and I don't know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are.
sd	But you see these people in their seventies
sv	That's the problem.
ny	Yeah.
sd	but today I went to see REGARDING WITH HENRY.
sv	It was really good.
sd	Jeff Wariner just got out of the hospital
sd	and everyone enjoyed it.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer, on, choir tour and visiting friends and one thing and another. A lot of the ones I had wanted to see
sd(^q)	and so since he had this friend up from Houston, and his friend had already seen so many and I thought they decided on this and I thought well, I want to see this one, too.
sd	finally, it's my first summer movie .
b	Yeah.
qy	was that good?
sd	I love comedies.
sd	But, that's what I was ,
bh	was it?
sd	I'm glad to hear that because they,
b	Uh huh .
qy^d	Well, I don't know if you got to see WEEKEND, AT BERNIE'S that was out a couple of year's ago.
sd	They had a free showing at the Berkeley, United Artist.
sd	but we thought we'd try it, you know, free movie.
sd	I mean, we hurt by the time we came out.
sv	or it should be out on T V, I would think,
sd	Especially in the theater it was contagious, you know
sv	I imagine the way SOAPDISH was, but, with everyone laughing.
sd	Well, I'm glad you did that before your surgery .
b	Yeah .
b^r	Yeah.
ba	gosh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
b^r	Yeah .
b^r	Yeah .
sd	and to try and find time it's hard, with Jim's schedule, too, just to get a time that we can both go.
sd	And, I'm holding out for CITY SLICKERS for the two of us because, we had friends that went to see that and said, you know, it's just perfect for our age group
sd	but some of the different things we're doing, there's just not enough time to do it all
sd	and he said, well, realistically , You know, he knew he couldn't get them all in.
sd	but the fire scenes and the dra , you know that action part is fantastic.
sd	but h but he enjoyed it
b	And yeah,
sd	I really, like him a lot. Which is why, DANCES WITH WOLVES was the last movie we had seen for several months
sd	We were going to sit through it again cause we really wanted him to see it, too.
sd	And I really enjoy Harrison Ford which is one of the reasons I wanted to see,
sv	That's not an easy part to play, I don't think .
sv	that one won't your sides .
qy	was this the first time you got to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS?
b	Uh huh.
sd	or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it
sd	And then I can decide whether I want them to do it or whether I can do it, see.
sv	and I thought that was a good deal.
sv	So those small little trucks and cars like that, the longevity of the brake pads is really good.
sv	I, I keep it that way because that is the key to the longevity.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	oh.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh .
qy^d	You're talking about the vibration dampener?
bk	Okay.
ba	Uh, oh.
ba	Uh, oh.
fp	Hello?
fp	How you doing?
sd	I'm over here in Plano, Texas.
na	sure.
b	Oh.
qw	or where are you at?
b^m	Arlington.
sv	Well, there's a lot of stuff going on in Arlington these days.
qy	Are you involved in any of that?
b^m	No.
qy	now, do you work?
bh	you are?
b	Yeah.
sd	Because I work for myself
sd	I miss, insurance and the steady paychecks that come.
bh	is that right?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I own part of a roofing company.
sd	in the Dallas, Fort Worth area.
sd	And, you know, unfortunately we were part of a bigger company
sd	and I do miss that. You know,
sd	but, on the other hand, I, I enjoy having the time that I have with my family and being able to, you know, work when I want
b	Uh huh.
bh	is that right?
b	Yeah.
sd	that is the single most benefit that I enjoyed, and I do miss
sv	and it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it.
b	And, yeah,
sd	and if you want to add dental to it, I mean, that's that eats even more.
sd	I guess the other benefits that I, that I miss, I guess is, you know, some of the bonuses and stuff that that goes on with just being involved with a big company, you know
sv	and course, these days, you can't count on that because
sd	you know, I feel bad for the people that are involved in that, G M deal there in in Arlington
sv	and I'm sure it will be, you know, quite a few people are affected by that
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
bh	Is that right?
aa	yeah.
bh	Is that right?
b	Yeah.
sv	really the ones it's going to hurt is actually the businesses around in that area.
sv	You know, that's the ones that that that's going to hurt because they depend on that,
b^r	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I'll tell you, I I've had my fill of unions .
qo	Well, Michael, what do you think about, funding for AIDS research?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I guess I'm not too aware of how much they're spending right now . You know.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
ad	go ahead.
b	Yeah.
sv	I mean, I can see that research is needed
aa	Definitely.
sv	I mean it's becoming a major problem.
sv	But, I guess the area that I think more about is I would like to see them focus on, preventing it, in more, You know.
sv	It's it's, abstinence in certain cases
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think for a lot of people it has.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
^h	boy that's a hard issue .
aa^r	It really is.
sv	well someone who's not ready to give up drugs, You know.
sd	If they're perpetrating the AIDS problem, passing that on to each other, then you know,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I've heard, you know, different voices speaking up and saying we're not spending enough
sd	and, Mostly that's what I've heard,
h	so I don't know,
sv	And, yet, I know it sounds like big money to me .
sv	But it probably takes a lot.
qy	Did you have any fear working in the hospital with that,
bk	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
o	Okay.
sd	for example, the, local high school, they've already found two students with sawed off shotguns
sd	and they're starting to, get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school, of all things.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That's how they bind themselves together in groups, I guess
sv	interestingly enough, I don't think we have here, a lot of gangs, but, only a couple, of, not a whole large group of them, but, just a few. Most of them centered around, drug territory.
sv	And so they're protecting their economic interests, I guess.
sd	and then as you get out of the car, they just, step up and, take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house.
sd	They just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want.
sd	off they go with your car.
sd	I think they call it car jacking around here .
sd	and my wife's from Florida
sv	and it's, really scary sometimes.
sv	And it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school
sv	and that's what's causing all the killing.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	And they see all their friends and neighbors,
sv	and, I think, to a large extent, they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised.
sv	and they they say, well, it's the law that's, got to be changed instead of their way of life,
sd	I'm glad it's not the kind of problem I have to come up with an answer to because it's not easy.
b	Uh huh.
sv	They've always been with us.
b^r	Uh huh.
qw	What is your, community, currently doing with regard to recycling?
sv	and, they're not, too inclined to do something as aggressive as that .
b	Uh huh.
sv	That type of thing.
sv	But, people need to be more conscious of it.
sv	And that's the big thing, I think, that they try to promote.
sv	I think that's what they need to do. Be more proactive like that.
sd	because they don't degrade over such a period of time.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qo	And, how about you ?
aa	yep.
sd	you still have to do it.
bf	So you're in favor of capital punishment, then.
b	Right.
sv	Needs to be punished or, eliminated from society.
b	Uh huh.
sv	it's a difficult, problem, isn't it, to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime,
b	uh huh.
qy^d	It was almost really self defense, isn't it, in a case like that.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know they put them in jail sometimes, I guess.
sv	That's kind of drastic punishment.
sv	Might make you feel better
b	Right.
sv	There's a lot of folks, probably, that are in prison that aren't really a danger to society,
sd	I'm not sure what kind of, capital punishment we have here.
b	Uh huh.
qy	are you working right now?
qw	what kind of work do you do?
qy^t	is that how you heard about this thing? .
sd	I work at, the Georgia Tech Research Institute.
sd	We don't really have any vacation or, you know, sick days or health care or anything really
aa^r	Exactly.
qo	What about you?
sv	and I think that, they might, you know, pay for that. Pay for the classes and stuff
sd	You know, they'll let you work halftime if you want to finish,
sv	so that will probably help out.
o@	But, Do you get any kind of health care type stuff?
b	Uh huh.
sv	but it would definitely be something to look into once I get my own.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm learning and stuff because, I'm you know, in school.
sd	But there's some weird law where, student employees working for the government don't have to pay Social Security tax.
sd	Though that's about, five percent right there
sv	That's about the only real bonus
sd	so I have to take that into consideration when I evaluate like how much I get paid real, you know, because if I was working somewhere else I'd have to, you know, pay an extra five percent, or so.
b	Yeah.
bh	yeah?
b	Yeah.
sd	we pretty much work from project to project well, you know, with different sponsors.
sv	I don't think anybody pays too little.
qy	Do you get hit up for local taxes there?
bf	so y , you get the whole smorgasbord.
sd	Well, I actually live in New Hampshire tax free or die. Uh huh .
sd^e	actually there's no sales tax in New Hampshire either.
sd^e	what there is, is very high property taxes because that's how they fund schools and everything.
sd	so they they hit me up for the five percent there.
sd	it's only a state tax here, no local.
sd	We've got a five percent sales tax.
sd	But, the problem is that I'm paying state tax even if I don't live here.
sd	But, at least on things like stock options and things like that, they don't tax me.
sv	So that's not too bad.
sd	I mean, I, I'd consider twenty percent lucky because I mean, you know, when you figure out just on feds, you know, I actually hit the thirty one bracket this year, which was no fun.
sd	and also, you know, then you figure out seven or eight percent for F I C A which is taxes where you,
sv	most people forget about them, because you know, you can't always get your F I C A back at the end of the year.
sd	so, you know, and then, you know, like a five percent surtax, I'm paying forty percent tax.
sv	and you need you n , you know,
sv	I think government does a better space program than you're going to get out of private individuals,
sv	but, you know, I think, you know, you look at things like, you know, tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because Jesse Helms wants it that way
sv	or, You know, and, and just tremendous amounts of, you know,
sv	so much of it, is now just going to service debt or you know, is going into, into programs that, you know,
sv	I think that a lot of the H E W services, although they're providing necessary services, have too much fat in them.
sv	I think it's all going into bureaucrats.
aa	yeah.
sd	The great communicator,
^q	Congress, they're the fault for it.
sd(^q)	because like in New Hampshire, they say, all right, let's cut the military budget.
sd	then, you lose half your jobs in New Hampshire
sd	and they're not contributing taxes.
sv	So, you know, it's very hard to say, you know, this is what we should cut.
aa	yeah.
sd	this, this guy both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which, unfortunately violates New Hampshire constitution for our local town to have people line item their taxes.
sv	Course, the only problem with that is then nobody paying for the necessary services they don't use.
qy	do you want to go ahead
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	and they're all married.
sd	And, I love seeing the men help the women so much.
sv	I think it's great.
aa^r	That's right.
sd	If they did that, you know.
sv	And a big thing that I see. most of the women getting married now, have gone back to, you know,
sd	they stay at work or go back to work. Or whatever.
sv	And they're well educated.
sd	They're having a fit about how little there are.
qy^g	And I think we'll see a lot more. Don't you? Of upper management? Then we do now, even.
sv	I think it'll escalate.
sd	in fact I work at a high school.
sv	and the ethnic thing you know, is a good thing now.
sv	so you're going to see a lot more of that in leadership I believe.
b	Uh huh. Right.
sv	That's a shame.
^q	But they wouldn't know what they're doing.
sd	But I'm not big on subserving as far as to the men at all.
sv	So that was good.
sv	So I think that's good. To keep the equal as far as, not, nex , necessarily by sex type thing. You know.
sv	And I think the, attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now.
sv(^q)	You see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls, you know you can do it.
sd(^q)	If he can do it, you can do it type thing.
qo	What about politics on it?
qy	Do you think the political scene?
sv	and I really think we should have more political leaders in the women than we do and even for President and Vice President this year,
sd	I forget her name now.
qy	But you know who I mean?
sd	And their tax deal and,
b^r	Right.
sd	I didn't see any of the women in there.
sd	And that disappoints me.
sv	Schroeder's about the biggest one in Washington.
qy	Well, have you ever served on a jury?
sd	and then I was not chosen.
bh	really?
qo	Well, could you give me an example of a case where you think that?
qy	are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more, tangible
qy	Well, do you think that in a civil case, if there was majority rule, that it would be easy for someone to be set up?
sd^e	I'm not.
sv	Well, I mean, I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served.
sv	and I also think, just like you were talking about before, why you were chosen to be on a jury that, just, the process of picking jurors is not always objective.
qy	You want to go first? .
sd	one of the things they talked about was, d , wh , what do we think about a judge making the decision?
sv	I don't think that they could be objective in every case, every time.
qy	you know what I mean?
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
aa	That's it.
sd	I mean, if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. If they have been caught, you know, point blank in the crime. There's, no question
sv	I mean, you know, we've gone through this over and over again.
sd	And it can go on for ten, twenty, years.
sv	I think this is a little ridiculous.
sv	I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers.
sv	And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the criminal system today. With plea bargaining.
b	Well.
sv	but you know, they get lesser sentences
sd	and I understand that the jails are full of people, you know, and that they have to do something.
sd	That we don't have, well a lot of states don't have capital punishment.
sv	And, I think they should.
sv	and I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say, it's, there's no doubt whatsoever. Like drunk drivers that kill people
sv	and they should pay for it with their life.
b	Yeah.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Oh, really.
b	Yeah.
qw	what would you do to change it? To make it better?
sv	I mean burned out.
sv	There's there's no possible way that you could, you know, feel good about yourself.
sv	If you had to do something like that, day after day.
aa	Not really.
qy	Well, do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like,
sd	I mean, supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you.
bf	In other words you're saying that, you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were.
aa	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
qy	are you on any kind of, regular exercise plan?
br^m	Step classes?
qw	What's that?
o@	and ... okay.
sv	I probably couldn't do that because of my knee .
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	I guess what I do now is I play softball, right now,
sd	so it's four nights a week.
sd	But, so I enjoy it
sd	instead of having to join a health club and make myself go out there, I went and bought a weight bench, and don't ever hardly use it.
sv	I need to make myself do that.
qw	What school you going to?
bk	Oh .
qy	Is that lifting weights?
bk	okay.
bf	Isometrics, stuff like that.
b	Yeah.
sd	I played baseball, all the way through
sd	and, you know, working out six hours a day, usually six or seven days a week that kind of, kept us all in pretty good shape, .
sv	and, I guess the job that I'm in it's stuff to stay on any kind of a regular schedule. / * listen; possible typo stuff = tough?
sd	Because I work some weird hours and do some traveling.
b	Yeah.
sd	and we had about, when I was there, maybe thirteen hundred people.
sv	So, it's pretty small.
sd	But I usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant.
sd	that's, fairly regular .
aa	Yeah.
qr^d	just, because you don't like to or because you won't be able to.
sv	if you do, if you do aerobics you shouldn't have any problem running.
sd	we ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough .
sv	you can't forget how to ride a bike.
b	Yeah.
sd	and the next semester they were required to do weight lifting.
sd	I mean, we had it for course credit,
sd	but still, I mean, it was pretty high impact stuff, .
b	Uh huh.
sd	so she'd kind of lay it on occasionally, you know, .
sd	eight o'clock in the morning, was our class.
ad	Wake up.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
sd^e	I think my wife has some.
sv	so I guess it wouldn't be sand.
b	Yeah.
qw	Well, what are you studying?
qy^d	, not in the, aerobic instructor type field.
sv	I mean, they, they really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups, with those things
sv	to me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared up and take the time to drive over there, and workout and then drive back .
bf	A little negative reinforcement there while you're going.
b	Yeah.
sd	that's where I'm really starting to get noticeable,
sd	I'm just getting real soft in the middle.
sd	I guess I probably put on about nine or ten pounds, since I stopped playing, which was about four years ago.
sd	But I intend, I keep saying I intend to get back into it.
sv	I, I guess at that point it would turn into a task, ,
sd	I don't consider it fun doing that,
b^m	Next weekend?
bk	All right.
b	Yeah,
sd	when I was playing ball we could like run all day and not be tired, you know .
b	Uh huh.
sv	but . That's a problem.
fc	you too.
sv	I think that gets us off to discussing the topic for tonight.
na^m	That is correct.
qy	Are you a movie buff?
qw	What have you seen recently that you enjoyed?
sd^e	I haven't.
sd	Consequently, I don't like these psycho things.
qy	do you have a V C R?
qy	Have you seen the movie CLASS ACTION with Gene Hackman?
sd	You know, it's one of those things.
sv	well, it's something that anyone can watch and enjoy.
br	Beg your pardon?
sv	he is.
sd	Saw it just again the other night, for,
bh	did you?
qy	Have you seen the movie, CROSSING DELANCY?
sd	I always feel so good when I get through with that movie.
qw	So, well what business are you in?
bk	All right.
qy	So is everything going all right up there?
sd	Half an hour, we do that just going to downtown Dallas.
qy	are you a native of that part of the country?
b	Oh.
qy	Did you have damage this year with hurricanes?
qw	Well, what movies are you looking forward to seeing now?
qy	Have you seen GREEN CARD?
sd	So I would recommend that if you have a chance.
ad	Well if you can get GREEN CARD, go for it.
qy	Have you seen that one?
sd	But I hope you have a very Merry Christmas.
sd	I'm looking forward to it.
qy	So, do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have?
qy	Do you watch a lot of T V to get the news then?
sv	they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened
sd	but it's recent material.
sd	It is the big events, not the little events.
sd	Not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of Broad and Main, you know.
sv	or they're making time because they to fill in an hour's worth of news.
sd	I get kind of bored watching T V actually, when I watch the news on T V because it goes so slow
sv	and, then there's nothing that, you know, really is like so exciting.
sv	Listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something .
qw	I mean what, what do you find interesting versus what do you find boring?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I mean, it's only been, three months or something like that since that happened
sv	But they like to tell us that it's going to be important .
sv	we might also be helped, though, because it will be easier to do business over there, too.
sd	and, I know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety two so that they would have it when it came time.
sv	But getting in after nineteen ninety two is more difficult.
aa	Yes.
sv	even amongst themselves, they're being somewhat protectionist, you know.
sv	and they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet.
sd	I'm sure within those people's minds, it's quite justified.
^2	Before they open up their borders to everyone.
qy	do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that?
bf	Against your will.
sv	being a former drug user . I, I guess I have to say at this point, that I do approve of it.
sd	because I know that, in using drugs I was not a good employee.
sd	b , you are also under their liability, under the Workmen's Comp.
o@	and, I work for a tire company Modern Tire.
sd	and that's where most of our, injuries occur.
sd	Then he's automatically, given a drug test.
sd^e	when he goes to the doctor the first time.
sd	I don't know if it's been a deterrent or not, because we have, just started using it for the past year or so.
sd	They haven't pursued it, you know.
sd	and he went to a separate drug testing firm,
sv	So I think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried, you know.
sd	And then I also had a friend who was just around some people that were smoking cocaine.
sd(^q)	Now then you always wonder, well is he just saying that .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	because you're endangering everybody's lives if you if it's something like that.
b	Uh huh.
ba	You're kidding .
qy^g	The executives, right?
qy^d	The executives?
qy	Wouldn't that be awful if you were if you were using, and lose your job and everything.
sd	like I say, I'm a former drug user,
sd	and so I don't use drugs any more.
sd	marijuana, cocaine and amphetamines.
sd	And all on the job, too.
sd	You know, it had gotten that bad.
b	Really,
sd	And I was losing jobs just from doing a poor job, you know.
sv	I mean, you know, there's all kinds of drawbacks, much less the drug testing.
aa	that's right.
b	Yeah.
b^r	uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
ba	goodness.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
ba	my gosh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I would think there would be.
qy^d	But they weren't?
sv	Isn't that awful.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd(^q)	And she said, he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill, you know where they go and dump all this toxic stuff.
sd(^q)	And I just, you know, went, where? .
sd	Let me move as far away as possible.
b	Yeah,
sd	and back then it was popular you know,
sv	but people have really you know, become wise about drugs
sv	and they really have a good campaign for the young people, you know.
sv	so. So, I guess it was just a generational thing.
sv	and that's good.
sv	That's the best way to stop it.
sv^t	well, I think we did it.
fc	So it's good talking to you.
qw	So, who's your favorite team?
br^m	Pittsburgh?
sd	I used to be a big Pittsburgh fan when I was little.
bh	really?
sd	I used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big iron curtain, or steel curtain.
sd	They just score just enough points,
sd	and I've been keeping up with the Saints a lot.
sd^e	the Saints are starting to impress me this year, you know, a lot.
qy	Did you see the game Sunday night or, Sunday afternoon?
sd	they ha , a fireworks display at halftime.
sd^e	and some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the roof caught on fire.
sd	So, they had to stop the game in lieu of the third quarter and put out this fire.
sd	and they were dumping the Gatorade bucket and everything.
sv	I mean, you just really can't tell what's going to happen.
sd	It's like about two weeks ago I was watching the Saints.
sd	And Morton Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal.
sd	And it was beautiful, right down the middle.
aa	Yes.
sd	Right now I've got it narrowed down to the top four teams.
sd	It's pretty much going between Washington. They are undefeated. And, Buffalo, New Orleans, and Chicago because Chicago has only lost twice
sd	Their only time they lost.
^h	I saw Houston play this summer in Memphis.
sd	and from what I saw the game Houston impressed me a lot.
sv	and if that was an off night I'd hate to see when he's on a good night.
sd	Haywood Jeffreys and Drew Hill and Allen ,
sd	they really impress me.
qw	who did they play?
aa	that's right,
sd	I remember that now.
qy	Do you have a favorite between those two?
bh	Really? .
sd	but I hate Dallas .
b	Yeah.
sd	and they've actually started doing something.
qy	Well, do you know anything about the expansion teams they're thinking about bringing in?
bh	Really?
sd	right now I think this Memphis, they're trying to get the teams.
sd	And that's where I was when I saw, Houston play.
h	but I'm not sure.
bh	Think so?
sv	but I think it might be them.
sv	And right now I think it's Memphis and I think Baltimore have a really good shot at it.
sd	and when I went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did.
qy	So, do you happen to be working for a large firm?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It's got eight thousand people.
sd	and then the rest is whatever you want to put in. If you put more than that or something like that.
aa	It's not bad.
sd	I'm sure it's not till like twenty five years, thirty years.
sd	Otherwise guess you can also put money, hold money back and then either use or lose it and that doesn't get taxed or can just have that money, you know, put in your paycheck.
sd	and ends up the best is to take a high deductible and take a loss, whatever it happens to be, if you happen to be a healthy individual .
bf	You mean, not even your, your car insurance?
by	that's too bad.
sd	I only get two weeks.
sd	We don't get them till your seventh year of service till you get an extra week.
b	Yeah,
sd	but now they don't.
sd^e	it's the Bell Corps, which is,
b	Yeah.
sv	I think it's still based on the old model of,
aa	Yeah.
sd	I don't think so.
sd	they're always laying people off, which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security.
sd	And, I don't know what they do for those people.
qo	what do you think was different ten years ago from now?
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, actually ten years from today seems rather short.
sv	but I do agree that, generally society has sort of, let's see, rushed everything ahead.
sv	But I think that has a lot to do with economic situation.
sv	it's hard to say because I think people were busy ten twenty years ago too.
sd	I'm twenty eight.
b	Yeah.
sv	It's just a matter where priorities are, placed. And that, usually as far as families are concerned, there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home.
sv	And now, it's pretty much an economic necessity for most, in most places for both parents to work.
sv	But I do think,
sv	But then there are a lot of people that don't have that. But, that really do need to work.
sv	And then } there, is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that, they think is surviving which is really more luxuries.
sv	but I tend to think that it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive.
sv	I'm saying that the group that is just trying to survive from day to day, where both parents are working is more of the majority than the people that have the higher standard of living.
sv	Because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing, middle class in this country I think that that's, in my opinion, the case.
sd	I mean I have met people both that, that just want to maintain the standard of living and those that really need the job.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right .
b	Yes.
ba	how awful .
sd	I wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction.
aa	yes .
sd	the RAIN MAN was one.
sd	and, and DRIVING MISS DAISY.
aa	you need to see that.
sv	That is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people. Two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was Jewish and one was black
sd	and this all took place in the South.
sv	And, normally never the twain shall meet.
sv	The acting was phenomenal.
sd^e	Jessica Tandy won best actress
sd	it did.
sd	Just as RAIN MAN, with Dustin Hoffman, that was tremendous and Tom Cruise.
sd	that was, what much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman.
sd	and a good bit of that was filmed right in Cincinnati. Which is just forty five miles from where I actually live in a suburb of Dayton.
qy	Isn't there a Kmart everywhere?
ny	Yes.
aa	yeah.
b	yes.
b^r	yes.
sd	Well, you know there are people, referred to as savants also, who can do most phenomenal things
sd	and everyone feels they are totally retarded.
aa	That's right.
sv	It's amazing .
aa	Yes.
sv	and again it, I think was a picture of relationships.
sv	Again the relationship, between the two, that, never would have occurred, by accident.
bh	Did you.
b	Yes.
sv	it's good because it does make you think, about your own family.
sd	And see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother.
b	Uh huh .
sd	Well he at least saw it one time .
^2	Just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is.
sd	He will do that, to research it and to be able to mimic a person, with the kinds of problems that he had.
aa	Yes.
sv	Well, I'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them.
fc	Well it's just, been delightful talking with you.
fc	but they're predicting some more snow for our direction.
fc	Bye, bye.
sd	we have a Sheltie Collie, a miniature Sheltie.
sd	and we're having a difficult time trying to train it.
sd	It's about six months.
sv	but I guess one one, one of them, or every once in a while, you get one that's not so intelligent because this one, it.
b	Uh huh.
qw	what's the best method?
b	Right.
^2	Stand outside with them until they.
sv	so it's kind of difficult,
sv	and, you know, you don't want to spank it or scare it, or anything like that,
sd	and, you know and then it runs right inside
sd@	and it does it. / * should be 2 utts; it appears that the "huh" is a br
sd	and you know, it won't it's little job outside
sd	and it comes inside.
sd	and, you know, there's certain spots in the house where he likes to go,
sv	but, you know, that's natural for a little puppy.
bh	really.
ba	that's sad.
qw	How old is it?
ba	Man that's sad.
aa	of course not.
sd	I couldn't.
sd	we try to, we're trying to take it on walks now, you know
sd	and we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash
sd	and you know, I mean, it's not even close to even being trained on a leash.
sv	they sometimes misuse their license or whatever you know,
sv	they treat them bad.
bh	really?
bh^r	really?
b	Uh huh.
qw	How long did it take?
br	Every, what?
bh	really?
sv	unless they get used to something, they're really nervous
sv^e	and, if they're not accustomed to something, they're really scared.
sd^t	so I guess it starts recording now.
sd	We live in the Saginaw area.
sd	fact as far as I know, the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here. or the grocery store or anything in this area,
ny	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and they took it, you know.
sd	and so I'm not really familiar.
qy	or, do you get money for it?
b	Oh.
b	Really .
b	Right.
sv	And now most of them are throwaway.
sd	I bought some Cokes the other day in the little bottles you know,
sd(^q)	I was like, God, how much were those bottles you know?
sd	And, they come in like, and eight and ten packs, you know instead of six packs
^q	it costs more for the bottles than it did for the Cokes.
b^m	In the bot , .
b	Right.
^2	Of green glass.
sd	Now, I know that like Minyard's and places like that around like Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of those grocery stores, they have like four different bins out front. different colors for different things and things like that,
sd	and they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them.
b	Yeah.
sv	more than it's worth.
qh	Well, who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away .
aa	yeah.
qy	Is that it?
sd	and I guess I was doing this for, actually, I was going to do it for my son he, he's in high school, so that he could make some money.
^q	I'll sit down here and call it .
qy^d	are you?
ba	That's nice.
fc	Bye.
qo	and how do you feel about them?
qw	What kind of a degree have you got?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	How long have you been with them?
ba	That's good.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
bf	But, for all practical purpose, you are almost a hundred percent covered.
sv	So that you've got small things to gripe about.
bf	Well, that sounds like you must feel really good about it.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
sd	and I get no benefits from them, at the part time work although, they pay better per hour than my sort of, quote, real job does.
sd	I'm, a computer scientist
sd	and before I got my degree, I had, done paralegal work for law firms here in Washington
sd	for a long time were just rolling in the dough in the early eighties
sv	and, benefits were just amazing
sv	but, you know there are other things that you get when you work for the government in, in terms of, more relaxed atmosphere.
sd	and, so I'm really kind of happy about that end of things.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	that's fabulous.
sd	because I have a cousin whose husband works for Hewlett Packard up in the Massachusetts area.
sd	he lives in Andover
sd	he's, specifically an engineer and does work with, the Hewlett Packard machines that do, sonographic imagining
sv	and it's amazing.
sd	and, he seems really, really happy with the set up.
b	Uh huh.
qw	So, what kind of music you into?
sd	I'm into, some industrial music that's, a bit even harder than that.
sd	But it's got to have a point to it.
qw	What kind of progressive stuff?
sv	it's, a lot of people like, saying that, you know, bands in that position, you know, sold out.
sv	and it's good music
sv	That's good.
sv	I'm impressed.
b	yeah.
sv	and and , that's about all he had going for him. Or still has, for that matter.
sv	You hear the same tune over and over again in a thousand guises
b	Uh huh.
qo	What's the standard?
aa	yes.
b	Uh huh.
^2	It's safe.
fp	Hello, Lynn.
qy	Do you have any pets?
qw	what are their names?
qw	Which is the dog and which is the cat?
sd	wife and I, we have two cats.
qy	are they, just house pets?
sd	that's what ours are too.
sv	well, that's a nice story.
na^r	sure.
b	Yeah.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
qy	the skunk, was it kind of like a cat to have around the house?
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b^m	and the skunk.
b	yeah.
sd	and, he chased after a skunk and got sprayed
sd	so we had to give him a tomato juice bath, and, get him cleaned up,
sv	but I suppose it was still in the instinct of them to to back up and get ready.
sv	something giving you some affection as well.
b^r	Yeah.
qr	do you like big dogs or or little dogs?
b	Uh huh.
b	Really.
b	Yeah.
^2	almost cruel for him to walk.
ba	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	we've got a calico cat too.
sd	and it was an experience that they didn't enjoy at all.
b	Yeah.
bh	Really.
bh^r	Really.
b	Oh.
ad	Tell me about your home.
b	Huh uh.
qw	What area do you live in?
qy	Is that pretty typical for your area?
b^m	Yeah.
qy	Do you have a big lot, or anything like that?
bk	I see.
sv	In a big city like that most houses, I would think, would be sort of like what we live in. Just a you know, basic tract house.
b	Yeah.
qy	is that true?
b	Yeah.
sv	So that's maybe not so typical,
sd	and then you get those Visa bills in.
qy	you know, can you compare yourself to any thing around there.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	you have to, the yard to deal with
sd	I almost wish I was in an apartment or something. You know,
qy	Do you know?
qy	I mean, do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation?
sd	the typical homes there are like, you know, early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds,
sv	and, you know, there's not a whole lot you can do with it.
aa	That's true.
sv	Its like a rat race sometimes.
b	Yeah .
b^r	Yeah.
bf	It sounds like you enjoy working outside as well.
sd	So, you know, I'm just kind of trying to stick in with that,
qy	Do you do a lot of gardening?
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
qw	what do you do?
b^r	Yeah.
qo	Let's see what else do you do to your house?
b	Yeah.
sv	you could probably do that.
qy	Do you not, like, have a half bath.
sv	That was a pain.
sv	You get to know each other very well if you have to share a bathroom .
qy	Well, do you have any children?
qy^d	And they enjoy where they're living?
^g	Right.
qh	why not.
qy^g	So you think that you want to move away from the big city,
qy^d	You want to go back to that,
qy	So are you from Texas?
sv	and I, embarrassed to say, it's pretty trivial.
sd	but I doubt I do it more than three times a year.
sd	yet I I do everything on paper .
sd	I don't even use a calculator for the stuff I'm doing because it's all pretty round numbers.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
sd	I can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making you know, fancy budgets.
sv	It seems like if you're getting to that level, you're not in real good control.
b	Uh huh .
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	Actually, I mean, I like using credit cards for everything, but just paying off the bills because that way it's a record of everything
sd	and I don't have to worry about keeping records of anything else because they come in at the end of the month.
sv	Yeah, I guess if that's if that's a weakness, that's a good thing to do.
b	Sure.
qy	Do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that
ba	Well, that's good to know.
b	Yeah.
sv	It seems like it's absurd the number of people who end up having to pay somebody to do it.
b	Yeah.
sv	and a lot of them.
b	Yeah.
sd	I, I don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer, too much stuff like that because I want to make sure that I, I keep on top of the numbers and understand what's going on.
sd	if they make a mistake, they find out two months later because they weren't paying attention.
b	Yeah.
sd	We have the same thing.
ny	Yeah.
b	Sure.
qo	so, what are your views on capital punishment?
aa	Yes.
qy	So are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state?
sd	that's similar to Georgia.
sv	I guess in a way that, it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if,
sv	that would be the intent of it.
sv	Well, I think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner, if there weren't so many appeals.
sv	if the person who's going to commit the crime knew that they were going to be punished severely, possibly capital punishment,
sd	I work, with Georgia Tech.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but I guess there's other factors that,
sv	But, p , pumping more money into the school system is a good thing,
b	I see.
b	Uh huh.
ba	So that's a difficult situation.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
aa	Well, that's probably true.
sv	there's no easy solution for that.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah.
sv	certainly capital punishment isn't going to solve a lot of problems
sd	I guess I am for certain cri ,
sd	in certain crimes.
sv	premeditated murder. Crimes of that nature, I think should definitely,
sd	any mass murderer type individual.
sd	Well, you always have castration .
sd	I read about that .
ad	you're first.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
sv	but not being in say the commercial sector, the motivation isn't there for a lot of people like really,
sv	but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have, a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances.
sv	it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance
sv	But I agree, you know, the, medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the, security aspect for long term employment,
ny	yes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Like in some of the large oil companies. There has been massive lay offs.
sv	so I think it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in, institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses, we need to cut back, that's what we do.
sv	it's where it's most expedient which, Well, in one sense for us, it's where it makes the least noise which means it's often the lowest support type roles.
sv	It's very easy.
b	Yeah.
sd	Because it's support people that are providing the speed for it.
sv	there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe
sv	although you know, the more complex your structure the, less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through
sv	and so you can see the reward of the efforts.
b	Right.
sv	You end up being your own person
sv	and, if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up, well then that's their problem
sv	It becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves.
qy	Do you have children?
sd	Because I didn't know if that would make a difference in how you felt.
qo	what do you think about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two,
b	Yeah.
sd	and, I had opportunities in high school, to work in some programs,
sd	and I agree with what you said that it's, it benefits the person doing it so much I don't think they realize
sv	and and it would certainly help the country, too,
b	Yeah.
sd	but I do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church they, do still have opportunities.
sv	But, I think that's a small, number could,
sv	And that was something, I think in the fifties and sixties, seemed more common in the last two decades.
qw	What part of the country?
sd	so we're not far apart.
sd	so I know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area.
b	Oh.
sv	if young people had to do it maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things I always thought was a wonderful part of our country. is helping others .
b	Yeah.
sv	they're, things even just starting around the home. You know
sv	little ones can do a little bit to help the family.
sv	and I think that's a good place to start again.
sv	I mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is.
sv	gosh I'm sure, not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas
sd	but they have a high school group that works in the Appalachia area every year.
sd	They've done this for fourteen years now.
sd	Some of the things, that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there
sd	and that's just the two weeks during the summer.
sv	So, if two weeks, could have that kind of effect I would think,
b	Okay.
fc	Well, I enjoyed talking with you.
fc	And I hope you have a good evening.
ft	Thanks.
fc^r	bye.
sd	and they weren't worth anything anymore.
sv	it just really wasn't worth it.
aa	Yeah.
qy	Have you all got the individual containers yet?
sv	They were fine on the big green containers
sd	and then that they would sort it as as needed.
sd	so they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than having a household try it.
sv	that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week's worth of trash for a house.
b^r	yeah,
aa	That's true.
b	Right.
sv	and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there, by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to crash, you know break them,
sd	and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted for the day
sv	just a little bit of begging will ,
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
qw	Where do you take your cans?
qy^d	Buying a car is, something you're contemplating, I take it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	it's a nineteen eighty seven
sd	so I think the four door is probably a major requirement
sd	you know, I'm not looking for one with a great big engine,
sv	and I think that's probably a little over kill for this day and age.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and it's it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one.
sv	and I figure if it's so bad that I need a four wheel drive, I probably ought to be home anyway .
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
qw	what make is the mini van?
bk	I see.
b	Right.
sd	One of my sons has a Plymouth, van or, you know, that same type of thing, the Voyager, I guess
sd	So, I know if we had kids still at home, we're in our fifties now, but, if we had kids still at home, we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value.
qy	Is that something that you'd be interested in
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	I guess we collect milk cartons and whatever other plastics are acceptable.
sv^e	I didn't think that anybody had those at all yet.
sd	and, I'm kind of anxious to see them.
b	right.
b^r	Right.
sd	You know actually, we had milk delivered to our house in glass bottles
sd	and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house.
sd	You could just leave the milkman a note on what you needed
sd	and he took them away and you know, put another gallon of glass bottle in there.
b	So, yeah,
sv	Just, To see stacks and stacks of newspapers just to the trash is just amazing.
sv	seems like there's a p , pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics
sd	I didn't know what to expect.
b	Right.
sv	Well, I guess they will shortly.
b	right.
sd	Do you know, in Tom Thumb yesterday, I saw the return to the small Coke bottles.
sd	And I don't know if there's a deposit on those or not.
sd	they'd be, I don't know, maybe ten ounce or six ounce or ten ounce. sort of a small size and anyway we just, we didn't stop and look at them a long time
sd	and they were packed in the old sort of six pack stick them down, you know, sort of a basket type thing.
sd	so, I hadn't seen that in a long time.
b^r	yeah,
sd	He doesn't, Doesn't,
aa^r	right.
qy^d	I wonder where they dump that.
sv	well they must keep it separate if they have this date in.
sd	They have this day now, that it's, you know, separate from the other trash pick up.
sv	but, It's out of control.
bh	Really?
sv	okay, I would not have guessed that in Seattle.
ny	Yeah.
sv	I mean, it seems like our, the prison systems, we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system.
sv	and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes
sv	I'm not convinced that I have.
sd	and she was dealing mostly with people that were in on drug crimes
ny	Yes.
sd^e	In a in a maximum security prison down in central Virginia.
sd	the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison.
sd	but I just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and really annoy a lot of people.
sd	and, she got a couple of inmates that she didn't feel quite as comfortable around.
sd	so next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison.
sv	and I'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people that run the system have given up on it.
sd	I always have problems because I can never decide whether or not I'm supposed to be a conservative or a liberal
sv	But I keep, I keep thinking that there's got to be some way, that a lot of this is circumstances.
sv	I mean, I can't help but wonder if I grew up without a father, on the streets, and with like little or no money, wouldn't wouldn't I be in prison at this point?
h	I mean, I don't know.
sv	We've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs can't get onto the program.
sd	and what he,
sd	Well, what he wants to do is take all the money that, he gets for drug enforcement and use it for, drug education.
sd	And basically, just attack the problem at the demand side.
sd	it's been, well seventy nine since I was at school. At high school.
qy	You know what I mean?
sd	and I certainly see how much I pay in real estate taxes every year.
sv	I mean, somebody's getting a good education because we, continue to employ people.
sd	But, I don't understand the, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities.
sv	I think I blame it on the school system.
sv	well, they do quite well for themselves .
sd	and they both have, like second jobs that they work in the afternoons.
sd	And from their teaching job alone, they pull in forty grand each.
sd	I agree that teaching our kids is important.
sd	And I don't even have kids .
fp	Hi .
sd	I should say something.
sd	and I, I never watch T V news nor listen to the news on the radio unless I'm just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before I can turn it off.
sd	I do learn about things. Largely from friends
sd	and then I'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier.
sd	But, I mean, I don't think it's just that I'm lazy .
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	So, I mean, I'm not being elitist in that sense, I hope.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think it's like ninety nine point ninety nine think it is, percent.
qy^d	you don't?
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I did, on the Supreme Court hearings, for, the whole business of,
sd	the Thomas and Anita Hill business.
sd	I deeply cared about that.
sd	But even then, I didn't end up doing it on my own.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think if we wait, which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it is going to be to late.
sd	I have heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand.
sd	I can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store
sv	and that is very inconvenient cause I have to wait until I have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile.
b	Uh huh.
sd	bottles
sd	but there is no place to,
sd	We have a pilot program in Arlington going on I think in the north part of the city where they have people separate the trash as they put it out.
sv	And I think that is what it is going to have to come to. Where we are just forced to.
sv	just because they have to. You know,
sd	It's trouble for me to do what I do
sd	I mean, I am willing to do it
b	Yeah.
sd	In Iowa, the state I am from I believe it has gone up to a dollar now.
sd	Every time you buy a container, no matter what it is, whether it is glass, whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever, you pay ten cents for it
sd	and you get it back.
sd	And, you also don't see the litter there.
qy^d	I don't know if you've tried it
sd	and they have on the ba , it's five cents, that they pay five cents
sd	and it even shows the states that,
sd	I am looking at it right now.
sd	So, I have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do they save like the paper they use at the office paper.
qy^g	Because there is a lot of waste there isn't there.
b^r	Right.
b^r	Right.
sd	like, I have decided Downy Fabric Softener now has where you can buy a little carton
sd	but I am going to stick with Downey because they were first.
sv	There is so much plastic.
sv	and they don't want to think about it.
sd	You know, I want to feel like I at least tried.
sv	It may be too late.
ng	Very little.
sd	Well, that doesn't do me any good because I don't have any place to burn it.
sd	And then just like the glass bottles, that it says on the bottle I can get ten cents, but not in Texas.
sd	So, I still throw away a lot of glass.
sd	and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley.
sd	and it's like seventy percent of it is from cars.
sd	and we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the Wasatch front which match that of L A a few years ago.
sd	and now it's not in the mountain valleys.
sd	emissions.
sd	population is a lot lighter up here.
sd^m	They're eliminating that out here.
sd	Kind of like a radar gun.
sd	and you can look at the emissions actually.
sd	They'll set up like a trap or something like that in some sense.
sd	It was like four hundred times as much of certain pollutants, and it was like unburned hydrocarbons, then a properly tuned car.
sd	and the idea being that well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the pollution then, you know, it'd be one way to cut the pollution in half.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	it, you know, it, it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal.
sd	because you, you've got all the prison expenses, plus all the legal expenses.
sv	and, you know, it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent. for one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because I honestly don't think the people that are committing the crimes that would be eligible, you know, really care.
^q	You know, I, I'm never going to get caught.
sd	one way or another.
sv	but the other side to that is, if you put him in prison for life, there's a chance that he might do things in prison, you know, and somehow redeem himself.
^q	guess we killed the wrong guy.
sv	I've heard quotes, you know, it's better that a thousand people go free, than one person be unjustly imprisoned. I think is really the philosophy of the way our legal system works.
sd	Tsongas is also saying, you know, make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer.
sv	They risk their lives every day.
sv	w , we're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something.
sv	but you look at our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to like Texas or someplace that does, you know, it, it's impossible to make a case that it's affecting it in any way.
sv	I think it's mainly, people, like, they get the vengeance of it.
sv	You know, a, a sixty two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what I've seen.
sv	but you know, you know, what, the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society.
b	Right,
sd	and, the other thing is that, you know, I was reading through a book on, human geneo research
sd	and why, does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin.
^q	and, you know, if you take this regularly, you'll be a sane and productive member of society you know,
sv	you really get back to the question of, you know, is someone responsible for their actions.
qr	Do you work for a big or a little place?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	I work for, Lincoln Laboratory.
sd	We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech.
sv	So it's very much the same kind of place the technical institution.
sv	while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to, trying to think of what things were important, besides salary and a job. I guess, list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the challenge of the work and, the working conditions, things like that.
qw	what sorts of things would you consider important?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
qo	Now how do you mean that?
b	Uh huh.
qy	Well, you think it's better than to try to spread the effort equally among all the employees of the company
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	They went to a, a four and a half day work week rather than yeah, just cut everybody back ten percent. And, have to, give everybody a half day a week off.
sv	And I think you can do that for a little while
sd	Well, I used to work in a day care center.
sd	and this is supposed to be a very well known center here in Tyler who had two or three, centers, all over, you know, the, city
sd	and they would, be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left.
sv	So, I think you know, if you do, do day care centers, you know you should make frequent checks to check in on them when they're not expecting it.
sv	Because they do things differently when you're not around,
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I mean they had two teachers to every room. sometimes three.
sd	And they had a good system like so when you walked in, everything looks cool.
sv	They did not show them care to these small children who are being left.
^q	this child was crying and needed some comfort, you know,
^q	what is your problem.
ny	Yes.
sd	they had like, the crawlers, the babies that didn't walk in one room. The ones that were starting to walk in one room.
sd	Then they had like the, three year olds, upper fours, lower fours, upper fives, lower fives. You know, just like that.
sd	You know, they really did separate them well.
sd	It was just the teachers themselves.
sd	that they're not,
sv	but, you know, the caring just wasn't there.
sv	and she was fabulous.
sd	But, every one of the others that I saw was just screaming and yelling and, you know, would make me a nervous wreck,
sd	these kids are just in a day care center all day and, with any type of emotional, you know, getting care,
sv	they're just there. You know. Going through this routine, which is lousy.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sv	you don't see that much.
ba	That's cute.
sv	that has to be with a day care center.
sd	that's a new one, on me.
b	Uh huh.
qy	So do you have P C s?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	but neither one do we really own.
sd^e	both of them are sort of work related,
sd^e	that's the nicer way, right.
sd	and these computers actually are from France.
sd	One of them's a Compaq
sd	it's a three eighty six
sd	we decided not to get the which is actually another loaner one too that we picked up for a consulting job that my husband was doing ,
sd	well, I actually do some work, working at M I T and at NIST, National Institute of Standards and Technology in Washington,
sd	and then I worked for Dragon Systems for a while.
sd	it's very different in the different places,
sd	and I do a lot metacoustic phonetics and looking at the acoustic characteristics of speech,
sd	Mostly I use it for writing papers and things like that.
qy	do you know Latek? Wo , Word text processing,
sd	but I don't usually use a word processor to do it
sd	and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that.
sd	but we have a modem.
na	Right.
sd^e	we have .
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
bf	So that was it.
qy	Do you hear, the beep in the background.
sv	that's an ambulance or something going on here, I think.
sd	In Manhattan.
sd^e	I'm at home.
sd	I can't do this much later than now, between sort of like six, five thirty and six thirty or something like that, because the traffic outside, they honk the horn so loud I can't even hear the phone call.
sd	about twenty after four.
qy	And, did you ever try using like Prodigy or any of those systems?
b	Uh huh.
qy	did you use commercially available software
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	but I've heard both good things and bad things about it.
b	Uh huh.
sd	people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use.
b	Uh huh.
qrr	Or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days?
sd	My brain is going to mush.
qw	And what do you work on at T I?
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	So, with the issue of trial by jury, I actually found the whole question about whether you need a unan , a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting.
no	I don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because I thought there were cases I don't know if it's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors, but where it was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve.
b	Yeah.
sd	But I don't know whether you need a unanimous, vote of not guilty to acquit.
sd	But I've never had the opportunity to serve on a jury, although I've been out here and registered for, I guess, about five years.
b	Oh.
sd	Well, the people I know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that, you know, after initially finding out where people stand, that the whole deliberation usually results, if there is you know, something like a nine, three or more severe and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they're right
sv	and in fact, I'm not sure that that's any more, liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than anything else.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'd read one book, I think it was calls TRIAL BY JURY of all things, that, went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases, and in many cases looking at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right, went back to the jurors, based on the deliberations.
sd	Some of them did say that, you know, when they were the only one left opposing the verdict, you know, everyone was getting on them so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict.
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	once.
qw	So, What kind of experience do you have, then with child care?
qy	Does it say something?
qy	Well, Does it usually make a recording or s ,
aa	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
na	I have three.
sd	but I used to work when I had two children.
sd	but I don't envy anybody who's in that situation to find day care.
qy	But, does your sister live in a big community?
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know a lot of people around here sometimes have, like, mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids
sd	you either know them or know somebody who knows them , to get to,
sd	I don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center, simply because there's so many kids and so many ,
sd^e	and, you know, colds and things like that get spread real easy and things,
sd	and, course, there's a lot of different types of day care available, too, you know, where they teach them academic things.
sv	take a long time to find the right place
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	when he starts toddling around and stuff.
b^m	Yeah.
sv	It would be nice to have him around
"	or the phone rang you know, at the wrong time .
qy	Do you work now?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	so I'm here all the time.
b^r	yeah.
sd	you know, but my kids are only elementary levels right now
qw	What is your name by the way?
sv	lot of interesting procedural things I think would be a good change if we're going to be talking about the subject tonight which in some I guess criminal courts the ,
sd	and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race.
sd	the jury that's trying, the officers in that case, is an all white panel.
sd	And there's been a lot made in the local papers of that, fact.
sd	They moved it up to the county north of here.
sv	and it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that,
sv	It was everywhere.
sv	and I think it would be very difficult to find a panel that would not have seen it and known of what was going on.
sv	But on the other hand, it's also saying that white jurors are not going to convict.
sv	the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or, or, let go based on whether, or not the person, whether or not the evidence says, that there's enough ,
sv	but I rather imagine there's some snickering about it. And a lot of the usually fatalistic, here we go again folks, kind of stuff.
sv	on, on one hand you know, on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing, these people beating the heck out of this guy.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah. ,
sd	and, she had a dispute, black girl.
sd	The owner of the store popped her.
sd	and the judge gave the woman who shot the girl practically a suspended sentence.
sd	and then, we have these, we have people wondering around with petitions trying to get the judge,
aa^r	Yeah.
sv	it would make life easier.
b	Yeah.
sd	Angie.
bd	Okay.
sd	spicy lobster with linguini.
b	Yeah.
ny	Uh huh.
na	Right.
sd	and that way, you can have a variety.
sv	fresh vegetables would be good
nn	No.
ny^r	yeah.
qy	what, white wine?
b	Yeah.
sd	so I don't know a lot about that.
sd	chocolate, something chocolate.
ny	Yes.
qy^d	you do?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That sounds good, too.
^g	right?
b	Yeah.
qy^d	I don't know if you've heard of her.
sd	and she talks about catering and, you know, goes into all that and the different types of parties, you know, different types of foods.
sd	my father owns a restaurant.
sd	it's in Lewisville.
sd	Trinity.
sd	That's public.
sd^e	it's not.
qw	what about Hawaiian luau.
^h	let's see,
sv	so it's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time, I guess.
sv	Star Wars is not too far I don't think.
qh	have you.
qw	So what do you know about it.
ba	my gosh.
qy	you think you'd, go up in space if you had a chance?
bh	Do you,
sv	That'd be pretty hairy.
ba	imagine.
sv	So, well, I guess they're talking about people going to the moon and stuff, now, wherever. And opening up those stations, whatever, filling them.
sv	I don't know if we'll ever see that up there.
bh	really.
sd	That's all beyond my imagination really.
sv	so you never know.
sv	Any of that stuff from the Jetsons, from that cartoon, that you would never imagine would become possible, and now we have a lot of those,
sd	but as far as me seeing it, you know, I don't know .
sv	but I think it's real vital important for the future, you know generations to come,
sv	but when they start showing the drawings and all that, I'm sure, you know, when they,
b	Uh huh.
qy	So did they scratch that Star Wars deal, you know, they one we was all worried about Russia and all that?
sv	but the economy the way it is all over, they probably cut back on on that, because it's not,
sd	I know,
sd	and we don't know who's handling them now
sd	so that's a whole different story now.
bh	really.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and one of them crazy crazy guys get a hold of it,
sv	Pretty much.
sv	I think we went through him though to get to Gorbachev on a lot of subjects
sv	But that way, you can't never tell that.
qw^d	Type of music is hot down in Texas?
sd	mostly folk music.
sd^e	I find myself, listening to a lot of, either old timer or New England, dance bands as well as, just more popular folk music and new artists coming up.
b	Okay.
qw	what about, classic rock type stations.
sv	So, some some of the older Eagles stuff was good.
sd	and I don't like listening at high volumes.
sd	But, some of their older stuff was, you know, quite enjoyable to me.
sd	You know, Hotel California and that era.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, down in Texas, you know, listen to a little country every now and then.
sv	I'm sure there's a lot of that down there.
sd	then there's the, Dolly Parton, Hollywood sound.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think some of them, the artists are even, hitting the pop charts.
sv	I, I think most artists are in to make a few bucks.
sv	But they're not in it to say anything or give a message which is what they were do ,
sv	late sixties, early seventies, they were they were definitely pushing a message.
sv	at least to my mind, Guns and Roses doesn't have too much to say.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
bf	i , it's the artist, not the merit.
sd	or I don't like it
sd	and then if I really like the song, eventually I'll figure out who it was.
qy	or do you just buy along the same artist?
b	Yeah.
qy	so you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an album, then you stop?
b	Yeah.
sd	there's a couple of nice, small coffee houses up in New Jersey.
sd	and, so if you like the artist, you buy the album.
sd	So you definitely get to try before you buy.
b	Okay.
bf	You were helping your parents.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	So you're remodeling?
bk	Okay.
sd	two summers ago I went to Massachusetts
sd	and we undertook a building house.
sd	and it's preconstructed you might say.
sd	We had to call in the excavators and have them dig the basement. Pour the basement and, went from the ground up.
sd	Our one of our main problems was,
sv	but I thought, gosh, summer time, you know.
sd	And one thing is that we had, we were going to pour the basement foundation.
sd	it was sort of sandy and and not, a very good finish.
sd	so it was okay.
sd	and then we just had like two helpers and sort of a family type,
sd	It was sort of just, you know, get his, you know, my bro , my brother and well, maybe, you know, my cousin's coming over today to help us do that kind of thing. So that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes.
sd	and then materials coming in
sv	and it's pretty neat.
b	Yeah.
sd	And they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something.
sd	And his mom just wanted a new house. You know,
sv	So it came really great
qy^d	Where you live it gets very hot?
sd	Because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in, you know, the solar game?
qr	what, are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or,
bk^r	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	so you have the sash windows in?
qy	did it go up and down?
bk	I see.
sv	they usually most of the time don't open very well .
b	Uh huh.
sd	and it's a never ending problem.
qy	is that true for Atlanta?
sv	that's probably not true only for Atlanta, but for just about anywhere.
sv	But mostly petty things and, no, nothing, nothing really too big.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	a strange case that happened, oh, it's about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine.
sd	and they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it.
sv	Now, there's a crime for you.
sd	and I saw an episode of the T V show, COPS one time that was in Pittsburgh,
sv	but I don't really think those things happen too often because, like I said, from what's reported in the news, at least, it's not all that common.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	and, the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in .
sd	But, even so, I mean, it's, it's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to like lock the doors when they go out , you know, and things like that.
sv	it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just, you know, sit out back, take a look at when people are here and when they're not just come in, you know,
sd	and, they could get in pretty easy and especially, since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open, you know, while they're upstairs playing music,
sv	it could still happen then.
sd	and those three guys take the evidence, go off, figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
sv	any jury's not going to disregard the evidence, you know .
sd	That may very well be.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's true.
qo	Well, How would you go about changing it?
^2	Leave the details up to somebody else,
b	Yeah.
sd	and that's it.
ny	yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's true.
sv	well, you, you know, you're talking to part of them that's paying for that .
sv	and when you stop and look at it, I mean, the judges, they're all former lawyers.
na	Certainly.
sd	Well, I tend to, take two kinds of vacations, the vacations to visit family and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sight seeing and things like that.
sd	but, my favorite is the indulgent ones, where we go off and, see places that have interested me since I was a kid, for the most part.
sd	and they're moving to Florida.
sv	you just have to go once a year.
sd	and then about once every three or four years I try to get over to England, because I lived there for a while, some years back.
b	Oh.
sv	beautiful people.
sd	and I'd real, really like to go because, I'm fairly recently married
qo	How about yourself?
sd	I've never, been on a cruise.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I've never been on a cruise.
b	Uh huh.
qw	And where have you been on these cruises?
b	I see.
bf	the Mexican coast.
bf	That's all Mexico, I think.
qw	Where are you from originally?
bk	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	yes.
sd	so I mean, it's not like I'm going home.
sd	My, my parents retired first to San Diego,
fe	thank God,
sd	They've been there eight years.
sd	And, you know, I just grab the car and drive everywhere.
sv	It's so funny.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	What's the best part, from your point of view?
b	Uh huh.
ba	that will be nice.
ad	Well, don't go in the winter.
b	Oh.
sd	Well, there are exceptions made for special occasions like that.
sv	But the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer
sv	I guess I would contemplate going on a cruise, all circumstances permitting it.
b	Uh huh.
qw	How long are the cruises?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I, go for a long time.
ba	that's interesting.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's really nice.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, maybe now things are calming down again. That will happen.
sv	Well, that's really great.
sd	I mean, as I said, basically all I've done is go back and forth to parents
sd	so we spent a week in L A
o	Okay.
sd	I have one seven and one five
sd	and, I'm happy with it.
sv	I don't really think that's fair. You know.
ad	so, go ahead .
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Right .
sd	All these kids have these really supportive parents, always up there for something.
sd	and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is. You know,
sv	as far as their learning, I mean, if the parents aren't, you know, willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning you know, they really don't have much of a chance at all.
br	Huh?
sd	and the kids are not motivated.
sv(^q)	and, there's nobody to sit them down and say, you're going to do this.
sv	and they can't just have it at school and then come home
sv	and there's nothing, you know.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
fp	Hello Ann.
sd	the other day, I attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling
sd	and, I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places
sd	and, they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste.
aa	Well, it's not too new.
sv	Actually, the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the E P A
sd	He was talking about, the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print
sd	and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling, they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away.
sd	We're doing some here in Cash Valley, the community here.
sd	We've got a couple of plants here that actually take, recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation
sd	and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them. Because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside.
sv	So one of the real keys, it sounds like, to getting recycling for, paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but the basic idea, it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill
sd(^q)	he says, well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them.
sd	He came to the conclusion, plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's low weight, but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space
sd	So his solution was to burn plastic. Collect it and burn it.
sd	Well he didn't deal with that.
sd	He just said burn it.
sv	So it's not very practical .
sv	well, real interesting.
sd	You are legal in your circumvention of that law.
qh	why should an individual just because the state can't really find out about it, be able to avoid paying sales tax?
b	Yes.
qy	with something like that, do your arguments still apply?
sd	Which is exactly what businesses do at the present.
sd	And there are some substantial, nasty penalties, if businesses try to avoid that.
sd	And I know they work that way say here in D C.
b	Yeah.
qr	Do you know anyone that, is in a nursing home or has ever been in one?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I mean she sort of went, you know, bananas
sd	So, I guess you need to, know whether it's you know, a no deposit, no return kind of thing whether ,
aa	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	so for, the first few years she had her own apartment and, you know, made her own meals sometimes. But could also go and eat someplace else.
sv	But I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sv	Then you only go there as a last resort.
sd	Or people send you there as a last resort.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
h	I guess.
sv	When you need it, you need it I guess.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Sure.
sv	And if it were you, you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price.
sv	Well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing.
b	Yeah.
qy	are you married, or ...
bk	You are.
b	Oh.
qw	what kind of things do you do?
b	Oh.
sd	but, I'm staying home.
sd	I'm just working a couple days a month,
sd	and we go
aa^r	yeah.
sd	I'm a nurse.
sd^e	so it's, it's real easy to work out my schedule, you know, to, to still stay in with that, and to have enough time to spend with Matthew.
sd	he's, just now really starting to get interested in a lot of things,
b	Yeah .
b	yeah.
sv	and, I think it's really hurting, the kids, you know,
sv	I think it's, it gives me a break.
b	yeah.
sv	and, I think that was really ideal,
sv	it's difficult,
sd^e	I've, I've lived here forever,
qw	where are you from?
b	oh.
b	yea ,.
sd	so that explains.
sd	we, we do a lot of things on the weekends together, the family,
sd	but, as far as during the week, it's usually, you know, just my son and I,
sd	he works for Coca Cola.
sd	So he manages a plant out here,
sd	and it takes a lot of time.
sd	we take walks, and go to the library, and try to fill our day with things like that,
b	Oh.
b	Yeah .
b	Right.
sd	and he works about an hour and a half away from our home,
sd	so it takes him a little bit of time.
sd	I was working in the evening,
sd	but, their relationship, when I was able to work in the evenings, really grew.
sd	just the time that they were spending together,
sv	I think it really, it really helped to have that time together.
sd^e	he has seven other brothers and sisters,
sd	well his parents have thirteen grandchildren.
sd	and he really enjoys it.
sd	But, right now it's kind of a difficult time,
sv	and the cost of living here is just so tremendously, you know, outrageous .
sv	it's difficult, to do it any other way.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
sv	at least, I just consider myself blessed that I can stay home .
ba	I know .
ba^r	I know.
b^r	Yeah.
sv	it has.
sv	and I think, the kids are where they need to, you know,
sv	they need to really focus on the children in this country.
sd^e	I didn't even really think about it that much, I mean, you know,
sd	but, it wasn't really that important to me,
bf	seeing how you really are, are forming this, you know, the mind .
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
^2	or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide.
sd(^q)	I've seen a lot of people just say well, you know, he'll learn everything when he gets into, you know,
sd	I can just see how much, of a difference it makes staying home with him, instead of, ,
sv	that's true.
fc	Well it's nice talking to you, too.
fc	Okay.
qo	so, what do you think, about putting the elderly in a nursing home?
b	Uh huh .
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I never thought of that.
bf	until they get over that hump of whatever it is they're dealing with.
sv	They don't like to keep them longer than a week.
b	Yeah.
br	What do you mean?
sv	that's true.
sv	and it depends on how sick the person is too. What you're capable of, like if you have a family to take care of, you know, of your own .
sv	That's not always possible.
sd	But, to the best of my ability, I'd like to do it until it gets impossible .
b	Yeah.
sv	You know, you need to check them out ahead of time.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
bf	Who know what they're doing with that.
sd	She's not ill yet
sd	and, she really enjoys it right now because she doesn't have to wash dishes or cook .
aa	Uh huh.
sd	and then, so if she ever does become ill, it will be like family around her.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and, I hope that I have something like that when I get older .
aa	definitely it's,
qy	Do you ever think that there's a crime that's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just doesn't deserve to live anymore?
b	Uh huh.
sd	but, even in that, situation he would hope that there would be people around him who would, keep him from doing the things.
aa	exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	if you put someone to death you obviously, can't reform them.
sd	they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while.
sv	I would think you'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than, you know, telling them that there's protestors out here at the, you know.
qw	but if you had, parents say or, or grandparents, whatever it is, who were ready, who you thought might benefit from a nursing home, what do you think you would look for?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well my wife's grandmother is in a nursing home in, Minnesota
sd	When we visit Minnesota though we go to see her.
sd	So it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to retain, clarity, say, you know .
sv	It's, must be depressing to walk the halls an , and see all these other people who really don't know where they are.
sd	I think sometimes, you know, I've noticed, some of the patients asking for things, just repetitively but things that are not reasonable,
sv	and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person you know, is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need, you know.
sd	but these two were.
sd	And when you walked into their room, they had brought all their furniture from their house
sv	and it must also give them a sense of, security and, and, and, you know, s ,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	that's, that's new to me.
qr	Do you, mostly get things from T V or .
sd	I am fairly knowledgeable of .
sv	That's interesting.
qrr	or is it something that is, a little bit different from that?
qy	do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader, like more long term analytical sort of approach?
b	Yeah .
qr	in sort of like, quality or sort of an orientation in terms of like, view point or the way the news is presented or whatever?
bf	Like a liberal type of bias.
b	Yeah.
sv	they generally make mistake on anything technical at least .
qrr	or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things?
b^r	Yeah.
ba	That's disturbing.
sd	you know, but I don't usually.
sv	if you just watched it during the Gulf War, that probably wouldn't tell you much.
b	Yeah.
fp	Hello?
sd	my name is Leslie.
qw	And where are you from?
sd	I'm from Dallas, Texas.
ny	Yeah,
qy	Well, did you understand you know, what it was for, what we,
ny	Yeah .
sd	but we can try it.
qy	Are you ready to start?
ad	just a minute .
b	okay.
sd	Well, I don't really watch too many T V shows other than, occasionally I'll turn on DONAHUE because it comes on in the morning when I seem to be getting ready around here.
sd	and then I think I enjoy when I catch it, I don't even know what night it's on, but DESIGNING WOMEN sometimes,
qy	do you? .
sd	And then there's a new one that started out that I've caught a couple of times called GOOD AND EVIL, I think.
bh	really?
sv	I guess I watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that I have to see it.
sd^e	I haven't watched that.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
ba	Sounds neat.
qw	Is that on, what station?
qw	What other shows do you like?
sd	and I usually have kids around so I don't end up watching that one is the only problem I have with it, I guess.
b	Yeah .
aa	That's right .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qo	So do you know of any other shows in the even, or something that you enjoy?
sv	that's always fun.
b	Yeah.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I also, course, like to catch the news during the evening hours
sd	So, usually I don't get a whole lot of news watching in.
b	Uh huh.
qw	So what have you seen interesting on OPRAH WINFREY lately?
b	Uh huh.
aa	that's right.
b	yeah.
aa	It is interesting.
sd^e	just, doing this as a fund raiser for our church.
sd	so it kind of makes it easy, you know, to do a little something for it.
qo	, how do you feel about it?
qo	What's your synopsis? .
sd	I think that it went up a thousand percent on most,
sd	but I don't know how convinced the people are of him yet, myself.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I understand.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should.
sv	That's probably more true than, a lot of people realize.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It seems to be headed in that direction too.
o@	Uh huh. Well, their knowledge , with, better communication processes in this world now that's reached them is more educated to the, ways of the western world,
sv	but I'm sure I lot of it's filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind , of what they're missing out on.
sv	I'm sure a lot of them are missing those household items .
sv	what we consider just, , normal everyday things to them is real luxury. Which is unfortunate for them,
sv	and of course, most of us, we don't really appreciate what we've got because we've been so used to it.
aa	I agree .
ny	Yeah.
sv	but I don't even see that occurring. because their internal strifes are more important right now than concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be adapted to I guess.
b	Uh huh.
o	Okay, well,
sd	and, I like, a lot of of course the classics, everything back from Bach and Beethoven and Chopin and, just in general everything.
sd	I enjoy, a lot of the modern forms,
sv	and, has a lot to say, or some of it has a lot to say, the lyrics do,
sv	well, it's, it's, it really expresses some of the opinions of the people who enjoy the music
sv	but as far as a musical art form, I just don't see a whole lot of art to it .
sd	and they usually do a lot of satire
b	Right.
^2	the monotonous the monotonous,
sd(^q)	I don't enjoy that at all when they're just talking about, well, I'm better than you, and blah, blah, blah.
sd	I don't like that.
sv	and then some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our, in urban society.
sd	It talks about, race relations and police relations
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	that's about my opinion of that .
sv	it's okay,
sv	The thing about country western that I don't enjoy is, doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it
sv	one country and western song sounds like every other, country and western
sv	They just play a certain number of chords
sv	and you have a country and western song
b	 Right.
sd	And I can't say that I like a lot of the very, very modern, rock and roll,
sd	but I definitely, I really enjoy the fifties, the sixties and some of the seventies rock and roll
o	Okay.
bf	A a good, a good southern solution.
sd	the things they asked to talk about were whether the judge should be the one that does the, sentencing.
h	at least, my understanding of the law which isn't very good.
sv	and I think that's probably all right in that they, you know, maybe know what the norm is for a particular thing.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
qy	doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than the judge?
b	Yeah.
sd^e	In fact, they're going to execute somebody at the end of this month.
sd	And, there's a big uproar going on right now.
sd	the, Governor, you know, has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not.
sd	You know, it's someone who had, killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Something inexpensive.
sd	I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years.
sv	and you'd hate to be one of those.
sd	The other thing they asked about was whether the verdict should be required to be unanimous. Which, again, I think is the way it is now. That all verdicts,
sv	At least in capital cases I'd think they'd have to be unanimous.
b	Uh huh.
sd	The paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial. And that there's one juror that is, different than the other eleven.
sd	and they say they're hopelessly deadlocked.
sd	And the judge told them , they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet .
sd	Six months so far they said.
sd	Maybe they could go with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their, vote.
b	Right.
bh	really?
sv	That's interesting.
qy	Well have you ever served on a jury?
sd	but I, never, got selected for a jury ,
sd	I sat for ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process,
sd	and they had some guy that was, defending himself.
nd	Well.
qy^d	I mean suppose they found out some other way?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
qy	But, have you ever been in a situation where you were drug tested
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	and I just thought it was dumb of the company, at a point where they were trying to convince me to want to work for them to do this,
sd(^q)	and I'm just like, well, I'm not even going to think much about it if you're going to treat me with this much respect even before you've gotten to know me.
b	Uh huh.
sv	well like you say, I mean, if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt, then really I mean, the, the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors.
sv	And, I mean, if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem, then they'll notice it for other reasons.
b	Yeah.
qy	Well, do you think it's, should be illegal for an employer to do this
b	Yeah.
sv	but an employer, really, I think, has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to
sv	and if they say they don't want smokers, I sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that.
sd	So, the topic is hobbies .
sd	I used to do, like salt ornaments and things.
sd	But that was, good many years ago
sd	and that's, about it .
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, well, that's what I meant by salt that we did that like as a family, little ornaments and, things like that, and just kind of really got into it. Like during the Christmas season, making them up for other people and things like that.
sd	I've just never been very skilled at, far, you know, needle, work cloths.
sd	And the things I've tried to do just don't look very good ,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bf	It's not, like you sit and knit every night .
sd	and my mother used to knit, you know, all the time
sd	I'm like, that's a lost art from this family .
h	it feels like, if, you know,
sd	I have seen things I really like, you know, that were done, especially like needlepoint.
sd	Needlepoint, cushions and things.
sv	But, it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it, you know, and that the petty point and things like that.
sv	God, it, it seems like it's easier just to go out and buy it already made .
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
bf	And see, they do that as their job. Whereas, you know, for us it,
sd	and they make it cheaper for us to buy .
sv	you felt very creative.
sd	But, it just was time, involved, you know, so much time involved and the different steps and things.
b	Yeah.
sd	I hope you have a good rest of your weekend.
br	Well, what were you saying?
b	okay.
sd	and I haven't really gone out, and bought any or listened to much on the radio except for classical
ny	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
sd	Well, I like most of them except for country music.
sd	but I don't like listening to it.
b	Oh.
qw	what's the old country music like?
bk	okay.
qy^g	That's the kind you like you mean?
sv	and I guess you could say it's similar as far as the way they do it.
sd	and, most rap I don't like.
b	okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I really haven't listened to that .
sd	I've been pretty busy.
sd	but I don't do that anymore either .
nn	No .
sd	I've just been real busy with lots of other things.
sd	Twenty eight.
sd	Changed directions.
qw	How old are you?
h	Put it that way.
ny	Yes.
sd	But I know what I like when I like a sound. A certain kind of sound,
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah.
b	really.
b	well.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I do play the piano, you know .
sd	But, I like the, early seventies, late sixties rock. Kind of stuff, the old stuff.
qw	does what songs does he play?
sd	I think I've heard SUMMER OF SIXTY NINE.
b	Yeah.
sd	I'm not very good at remembering the, titles,
b	Yeah.
sd^e	I don't watch T V much at all.
nn	No.
nn^r	No.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but she's from Ireland.
sd	And, she's been on like the top ten, I guess, or whatever.
qy	Kathy?
qo	what do you usually do as far as budgeting?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	So we're, budgeting, each month, an allowance for his education starting now.
sd	So you know, an, exact amount that we spend on that each year.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	I see.
qy	Like you have a separate account for that then?
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
qy	does he invest in that and for long term?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	It's vacations, Christmas.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
bh	Really.
qy	do you, run the family budget as far as, groceries and that sort of thing?
br	And what's that?
qo	or or how do you work that?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	I stay home also.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
qy	do you have like a household?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
qw	and so what do you think, next to salary do you rank, is the most important job benefits?
qy	Well, does your company have good benefits in that regard?
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
sd	my medical coverage is with an H M O
sv	but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	three years ago is when I first got into full time employment
sd	and, you know, for me it's worked out real good.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	I work for, Georgia Tech in the research branch,
sv	and I guess another one that I rank up there high is the, kind of job flexibility and time off, I enjoy as a benefit.
na	Right
bf	getting a lot of breaks between quarters and that, and having a lot of vacation.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	and that's who I work with.
sd	We can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study.
aa	Right.
aa^r	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've never had random drug testing.
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	they do with alcohol.
qy^r	They do it with alcohol?
sv	I thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine.
ba	That's interesting.
qw	What type of field of work are you in?
b^m	in the oil business.
qy^d	and you work in the office around.
sd	see, I work in the automotive air bag industry, where we make the safety bags for the cars,
sd	and we work around a lot of explosives.
sv	but still, it can be dangerous.
b	Yeah.
qr	Now do they fire them, or do they?
b^r	Uh huh.
ba	wow.
h	I'm not really sure what the ,
sd	but I'm not sure if if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in.
b	Uh huh.
qy	do you think it limits,
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sv	You could time it just right.
sv	That'd be just as dangerous.
aa	That's true.
qrr	or is it?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	We don't have any grandchildren yet.
sd	and the other is, twenty one.
sd	So they're, They're, they're getting there.
sd	You know, there's no no, no prospects right away for anything to happen.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's hard.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Huh.
qw	What did you do when your kids were growing up?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b^m	Right.
b	yeah.
b	Right.
bf	You can come and go.
qy	Well, does the company you work for test for drugs?
sd	our policies and procedures manual, the furthest it goes about drugs is in kind of the miscellaneous section, or it's reasons for immediate dismissal,
sd	but, I work for an environmental management firm
sd	but I don't operate any machinery.
sd	Now, people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a medical monitoring program,
sd	it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for.
qw	What is the nature of your company's business?
bh	really?
sd	but, you know, they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg. You know,
sv	in your case, I don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing.
sv	I think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	and she's real interested in geriatrics.
sv	and, you wouldn't know anything about a Texas governor .
sd	And, my sister's real interested in that and getting into to that side of nursing.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
b^r	Right.
sv	And some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive. Because cause they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older.
sd	It was in a very small town nursing home.
sd	They didn't care about what went on.
sd	They would let a patient get a lot of bed sores.
sd	And then, the nurses and doctors really didn't put forth any loving care for them.
b^r	Right.
sv	And nurses get so worn down.
sv	And they feel they feel pretty helpless.
qy	Is it, like a retirement center?
bk	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
qw	How's he handling that?
b	Uh huh.
qy	There wasn't anything like that, that you could do in Florida?
qw	What kind of crime do you think, is the most prevalent in our society?
qy^d	Such as New York City ?
sd	I mean it is a crime,
aa	Well, that's true.
sd	But I, I was staying in the realm of felonies versus misdemeanors and, drug use,
qy	have you been the subject of such a crime, such as stealing, or anything?
sv	I mean you know, those aren't,
sv	in some ways, it's almost worse than murder.
sv	you know, I mean, it is a rather final solution, though .
qw	what do you think is an appropriate, punishment for you know, things such as rape or, murder or something like that.
aa	I agree with that.
sv	I think Virginia does, too, up here.
sv	I think the appeal process takes too long.
sv	I, I think it from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year.
b	Uh huh.
sv	you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect.
sv	I think that murder itself would decrease significantly if there was a credible punishment, for murderers.
^2	And society probably, too.
sv	I mean, just general society to,
sv	and it decreases the prison population. which is significant
b	I mean, Yeah.
sv	generally the crimes of passion and things like that, are not premeditated.
sv	but usually they aren't.
sv	They're spur of the moment
sv	and, the premeditated murders, the ones where the person plots and plans, when you catch those individuals, I think that you how do I want to, you end up with a s , you end up with someone who's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time.
sv	they would have no problems doing it again.
sv	And I think locking them up for, you know, fifty years doesn't do any good because as a taxpayer, I'm going to pay, you know, one and a,
sd	I'm a senior in, college now.
sd	And, I can't really talk too much about the problems with, public education in detail because the school system I went to was, really superb even though it was a public school system.
^g	okay.
qy^d	a, it's a more or less a suburban school system?
sv	You know, I think that, I mean I know that in my town, you know, most of the parents, they're valued education.
sv	And, you know, and so the students were, you know, to some extent, motivated to learn.
sv	, but, I think, I mean even more than that, even, I mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read , you know? Which , I mean it sounds like,
sv	now I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because, they have these, sort of , tory tests you have to take before you get a diploma.
sd	I, I mean I just can't even picture how that could happen. You know, except maybe to someone whose, you know, really badly learning, disabled or something.
sd	But these people obviously weren't.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sv	I mean, I think you know, people just,
sv	I think it'd be interesting you know, to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school. you know, sort of maybe from elementary through, high school. You know, just sort of to get a feel for what it's like.
sd	But, I haven't done that .
sv	And I think it's a good thing.
b	Yeah.
b	Yes.
sv	I mean, I honestly don't really think I could have, you know, done much better than I did in the school system I was in. I mean .
b	Yeah.
sd	Then in high school it changed into four levels of instruction in the major subjects. which,
sd^e	we don't have the, national public radio in my area.
sd	but the F M signal doesn't reach this far.
sv	It gives you a whole different perspective on the news, when you hear it from, say, a European point of view, or from the country of origin.
sd	I'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper which is why I rely on shortwave and then the cable, cable, C N N.
sv	or it's not happening in your backyard
sv	they almost take all emotions out of it when they report it
sv	they seem to give more of just the facts than opinions.
sv	but a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to do the interpreting.
sv	it's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it
sd	And a lot of time I don't hear exactly what they write into it.
sd	So overall, I think I would rather hear just straight reporting.
qy	So. Have you heard about Saturns?
sd	Saturns, you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a Saturn dealer. this offshoot of G M .
sv	And, supposedly, they've got great customer satisfaction from what things I've heard.
qy^d	Well, like what?
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I, and I do most of the work on that myself.
sv	You can't do anything.
sd	I'd have to almost go take a class or something like that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
sd	Actually, one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety one Ford Taurus cause they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual side air bags.
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh .
b	Yeah.
sd^r	The ninety twos had dual air bags.
sd	You could get them with duals .
sd	So we're actually been looking around and thinking about things.
sd	A dealer return type thing on a ninety two and ninety three or something like that you know.
sd	Year old ninety two or something like that.
sd	And the other thing we're looking at is the Saturns too.
sv	Because they looked really nice.
sd	I don't think you can get dual side air bags.
sv	the I'd say the most important thing is a car that's not going to fall apart. That doesn't have problems.
sv	and you just get so depressed for the U S auto makers when you do that.
sd	and the two cars that apparently are close to that. That actually have high reliability, the Taurus is one of the highest U S cars.
sd	And the other one are the Saturns.
sd	And then, you know, we kind of want a four door.
sv^t	so I guess the recording has started now.
qy	Have you ever served on one?
b	Uh huh.
qr	Was it civil or criminal?
b	Uh huh.
b	I see.
b	Uh huh.
qrr	or did you folks do that?
b	Uh huh.
aa	No.
sv	That that's a science in itself.
bf	Because you'd probably be, too puritanical
qy	if you were deciding, do you think that they would have been different.
sv	I bet that made him happy.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
qr	Was it a six or twelve member jury?
b	Uh huh.
sd	It's a simple majority, you know, rules.
sd	the two that I were on had to do with drugs
sd	and we had to acquit him in both cases.
sd	I'd like to have a short work week you know,
sv	and we need, you know, better health insurance and you know, cau ,
aa	Okay.
^g	right?
qy	ready?
bk	Okay .
sd	but I've work in the job force before
sd	And have a if we could have a thirty two hour work week, with that happen is that, for every four people we could give another job.
sv	we'd have to build less prisons, you know, less police force.
sv	it, that's, that's a possibility.
sv	one of the problems they're facing now, a lot of people now, is that the small business can't offer health insurance
sd	what happened and where they really have to spend out a lot of money for one particular,
sd	They have to cancel everything.
sd	and then all the people don't have any insurance coverage.
sd	I'm an engineering student.
sd	I'm in my thirties, okay.
sd	and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose
sd	and and one of the things that I really hate about jobs. I don't like bosses that you know want to yell at you and you know are down on your back and all this and that.
sd	I just really can't deal with that
qw	what kind of jobs have you done?
b	Uh huh.
sd	You have what you might call knowledge power
sv	But if you're a person that's doing computer type things and you have the knowledge, you know what the system you've revised and revamped the system, well then you're vital to the company
sv	be one of the last ones to let go anyway.
qw	Where do you get most of your news?
qw	where are you?
bk	yeah.
sd^e	I'm in San Antonio.
sd	I take the paper every day
sd	and I read it on the way in to work in a carpool.
sd	And then, you know, usually over lunch, there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	one of the women that I work with, her husband is Iranian.
sd	So here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well I, I like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize.
sv	I understand that the MacNeil Lehrer probably doesn't.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
bf	They don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in every little town.
b	Yeah.
sd	I've been getting a kick out of those lately.
sd	so I've never actually been through a period of war
sd	Now when they started to speculate, I saw that for what is was, and thought all of these guys don't know what's going on.
sd	and they shed some light on what was going on for me.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and it was for children
sd	They had them all on hold
sd	and, I was real impressed at how A B C handled, translating, the war for children.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but they were free rental, videos, that had something to do with the war.
sd	It was something for children, that they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and, getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it and that kind of thing.
sd	Well back during the Viet Nam conflict that no one will have the guts enough to call a real war
sd	that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal.
sv	So I don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly covered by the news.
sd	the first three days, I was glued to the television.
b	Yeah.
sd	and Friday night I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning, sitting, right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open.
sd	I was amazed.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny^r	Uh huh.
sd	I grew up near Houston
sd	and the one I picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as I was growing up. I mean, the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff.
sd	and the other one has some weird ones that I've never heard of.
bh	Do you?
b	Yeah.
sd	And my, My fiancee takes probably six Sunday papers.
sd	so he's getting all the sports sections.
qo	What do you think about the benefits in jobs?
b	Uh huh.
sd	so that leaves you paying for all of it.
sd	the health insurance I have is Met Life,
sd	Or if you go outside you get, seventy thirty.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and they're probably doing it to their benefit, anyway.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, that's about the only real benefit you have, is health insurance.
sv	and, you know, I think they even have a swimming pool
sd	and I don't know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	Some places aren't very safe to work.
sv	and some places don't compensate you for the hazards that you have to work under.
b	uh huh.
sv	I think so.
b	Uh huh
sd	workmen's comp is a big thing now in Texas because, how much it costs the employers
sd	But I noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing.
sd	but they buy their own instead of going through the state.
sd	So apparently it costs less that way.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and then have everybody be unhappy and have a constant turnover of people.
sv	if they have to train a new employee every six months, then I don't see how they can save money.
sv	You know, and once they once they get somebody good, they ought to hang onto them.
fc	it was nice talking to you.
fc	Bye bye
qy	are there many lakes up there?
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	They have mostly small mouth in them
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but, they have a tail race over in Lake Lavon
sd	Every once in a while there'll be striped bass.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	what do you catch perch on?
b	Huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but, some fish steal it off the hook sometimes.
sd	there's a college across the street
sd	its mouth was full of hooks.
sd	he was fast.
sd	Well, it's, it was sixteen inches long.
sd	how your line goes, you know
sd	But, you know, I got it that far,
sd(^q)	and I said, that's a quick release, right there.
ny	yeah.
sv	when you have to look in their eyes and, you know, hit them in the head or whatever, that's what you do with a catfish you know, because you have to sever their spinal cord.
b^r	yeah.
h	I don't know,
sd	sometimes they've had you know, one on every hook.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	Wow.
sd	down here it's like two hundred dollars a day.
bf	A group party.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd^t	Well, I don't know if it's been five minutes yet or not.
fc	It's nice talking to you.
fc	Good luck.
sd	but, that's basically what I do.
b	Oh.
b	Right.
ba	Well, that sounds nice.
qr	or,
b	Uh huh.
am	Maybe.
b	No.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and in the wintertime I change to the sweaters.
sd	but it just wouldn't be, smart for me to do that in my home with my children.
sd	but it doesn't really change my clothing style.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
ba	dear.
ba	That's not helpful.
fc	Well, it's been great talking to you.
fc	Have a great day.
fc	Bye.
qy	Nancy, do you have any children?
b	Oh.
ba	Well, that's nice.
qw^d	Well, how old, does a child have to be before you get to stop making arrangements for him, I wonder.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, and, it's nice for them not to be alone.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Not after wor ,
ba	no.
b	Yeah.
ba	Well, I'm glad you have that, opportunity to have your mom.
sd	Well, I have two kids five and six, a girl and a boy,
sd	and, so far I haven't had to make a lot of child care arrangements for them because, I'm at home now full time.
sd	But, when I was going to school, I would go to school a time that my husband you know, when he was at home
sd	and I would really hate to be in a position to have to find child care .
b	Uh huh.
aa	No.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's nice.
sv	and it made me realize that, no one will love your child as much as you and your mother, and, the family
sd	what is that like, Kinder Care and things like that,
sd	I would prefer to have in home care, either my own home or a neighbor or something.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
bf	It is hard.
b	No.
sd	And I and I would hate for them to have, be picked up by a day care and be taken to another large group situation.
sd	So I think, my preference small, if I had to find day care would be a small, someone that I knew .
b	Uh huh.
aa	No.
sv@	Well, that's true, because even now, when they're gone to school, it seems like there's just not enough time left over * two utts in the day.
qw	What part of the country are you in?
qr^d*	East or west, I'm from Pittsburgh. / * listen
ny	Yeah.
sd	the South Hills area, Beaver County, well originally Beaver County .
qw	And, where are you from?
sd	I know where that is.
ba	that's pretty out there.
sd	I'm talking to you from Dallas right now.
ny	Uh huh
sd^e	my husband does.
qy	And how about you?
qr	do you have a rural house or what do you have?
ba	Those are beautiful.
b	Uh huh.
qrr	or is it?
sd	that's probably what I would,
b	Yeah
sd	I hear the , I hear the Western Pennsylvania,
sd	we lived in Minneapolis for about five years.
sd	and we met and got married
sd^t	and that's not what they want to hear on this call,
sd	my husband was transferred around, up to Minnesota and now back to Texas with T I
sd	and we're leasing a, two story town home in a section of Dallas they call North Dallas.
sv	well, it's not little any more.
sd	That's about forty five miles from us.
sd	Minneapolis Saint Paul is very clean
sv	but it's just everything's overpriced for the economy.
sd	and you're probably, your teeth will probably fall out figuratively speaking, it's nine hundred a month.
sd	if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living you know, the big apartment complexes
sd	and I just have no tolerance for that.
o@	I pre , * slash error That's right. / * slash error
sd	like a two by two they call it like in Pittsburgh.
sd	and now she can't sell it.
sd	I mean, our neighbors, the attached on the other side, they're very nice, thank God,
sd	they paid fifty eight for it.
sd	I know.
sd	and it's really, really bad.
sd	because we're considering moving to Pennsylvania .
br^m	That's north.
h	Bradford, no that's too far north.
bk	okay.
sv	Well, you're really not too bad.
qr	or that you've,
qr	or,
ba	well, then.
qy	do you feel like you live in an isolated area
sd	but I can remember when Upper Saint Clair was out in the, you know, the rural end of Washington,
sd^c	and now it's a terrible connection.
bd	well that's okay,
qy	do you like living in an older home and restoring it like that?
qw	How many square feet do you have?
qw	Well how many rooms do you think,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	that's large if your children aren't at home any more.
bf^r	That's large if your kids aren't at home any more.
b	Uh huh.
bf	It's enough space for two people .
bk	okay.
sd	It's got three bedrooms, two and a half baths
sd	it's really nice.
sd	but leasing it is fine.
sd	and my husband was raised, on a working farm near Dayt ,
sd	he's slowly getting me to, not feel isolated if we move to where there's more land.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	his parents have, land that they retired to, about a hundred miles out of Atlanta in Georgia,
sd	and it is too far south for me,
sd	I mean, it's just beautiful.
sd	You know, I mean, it's modern
sd	it's country
sv	Pittsburgh's housing economy, i , I think it's holding it's own.
ba	that's nice.
ba	Great.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and they've been in their house, probably about twelve years now
sd	they're going to start to see their return on their investment very soon.
sd	and, I mean, my brother lives,
qr	is it called Baldwin or Bebble?
sv	it's real pretty up there.
sv	And the neighborhoods are stable you know.
sv	when you come to this part of the country, we've been away from Dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing.
ba	my goodness.
sv	and what happens is, you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get we'll be staying in .
sd	that's kind of like where we're,
sd	and we're just kind of, you know, toying with what exactly, where we want to be, you know.
ar	and, but I disagree with that,
b	Uh huh.
sv	but it's still not going up.
sd	And I just refuse to buy it, if I know I'm not going to be there for at least five years, you know.
sd	and here, he told you this, every other house, you know, if it's been foreclosed on or, you know, even big executives
sd	People from J C Penney's from New York, came here about a couple of years ago.
sd	And they thought they were getting a great deal, because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with, they call it, zero lot lines, no property,
sv	I mean it would probably be like your house on, you know, a half a city block in Pittsburgh or something.
sd	I can look outside right now and look into the next unit.
sd	and it's landscaped and all that with azaleas,
sv	but it's still not that private.
arp	but you have a rider.
o	All right.
sd	We always lived away from our family and relatives while the kids were growing up.
ad^t	So, well, I guess we're going to talk about children today.
sd	My children are all gone already.
qy	yo , do you work?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	of course, maybe that's what we hear about is from organized and approved day care centers.
sv	But maybe we don't hear about the other ones though that could be.
sv	You know, the individual incidence or something.
qw	how old, is your oldest?
sv	well, he's plenty big enough then .
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but my last two children were, both entering high school age.
sd	and I stayed home the rest of the time.
sd	and they've been in day care,
sd	she works full time.
sd	but yet she's the type of person that, I don't know, if she'd be happy staying at home.
b	Uh huh.
sd	She's done a lot of things that I never thought she would do, you know, with the family because she was the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children.
sd	So, she spends a lot of quality time I think when she is with the children.
sd	They had a lady come in.
sd	And it did not work out. at all .
sd	She was real excited because it was so much easier than taking the children out, in the morning,
sd	and so she called and said things were okay, settled down and was all right.
sd	and things weren't okay .
sd	which she doesn't allow them to watch the soapies.
sd	And the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out,
sd	and the baby sitter was in the kitchen with her baby.
sd	And so that ended that, episode,
sd	and she was most upset, over finding this.
sd	There's, more people involved,
sd	and the age groups are separated .
^2	story time,
sd	it kept track of what they did,
sd	So it kind of i , kept them,
sv	I always thought that if you were checking into a day care, that you would be good to get references, on people that had been in that day care but was no longer there.
sv	if there was a problem they would I think be more ready to tell you what it was.
sv	They may not say anything.
sv	And, how do you judge other than from what others have, what you see, the cleanliness and that type of thing.
b	Uh huh.
sv	But it would be real difficult you, you know, to find one and decide.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I've decided I'm going to baby sit my two granddaughters.
sd	And so, I'm going to give it a try.
sd	I, I sell Avon and Stanley products,
sd	so I'll do my orders and that by phone.
sd	So, I'll be able to keep that up a little bit.
sv	But I th , I think I'll enjoy doing ,
sv	I think I'll enjoy.
sd	I guess I kind of miss having a baby around . A kid around or something .
aa	Yeah.
sd	somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun, they would have had them first .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	My daughter, always said she would not let me baby sit because you do hear grandparents complaining you know because they're stuck with their grandchildren so much.
ad	Doug, you want to start? .
qy^d	You don't use any credit cards, I don't imagine.
qy	do you use them a lot?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and he uses them quite a bit.
sd	He likes using them and then just pay at the end of the month .
b	Uh huh.
sv	And that's when you get into expenses.
aa	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and it's really useful.
sd	And some places won't take, you know, like personal checks or cash, even
sd	but they would take a credit card.
b	Right.
sd	like the gas stations more,
sd	we just don't, go there because there's enough other ones around that don't charge you anything
sd	extra because actually, to me, credit cards are the same as cash,
sd	to me they are, anyway,
na	right.
sd	Now we have, you know, at times, made payments on our things,
sd	We try hard,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	because sometimes, there's times when you maybe couldn't take advantage of something
sv	but with a credit card you can.
sd	but when you get down to the nitty gritty, there's probably three that we use most of the time.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
ny	yes.
sd	They make it very readily available.
sd	what they charge per year to use our money, you know
sd	so we try to look at that also.
qo	What do you think?
na	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	They should, have drug screening before they hire an employee
sd	like if they're coming to late work all the time and, if they're, especially if they're on the line or any kind of sensitive job where, you know, if they made a mistake, it would cost a lot of money or or people's lives. * slash Then they need to be watched carefully / * slash
o@	so, * slash Right. / * slash, should be aa
sv	That's all there is to it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's probably like forty, fifty percent.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Because, all the jobs that I've applied for have, mentioned some type of drug screening.
o@	You know. * slash error I work at Sears.
sd	And I just do warehouse work.
o@	so, * slash error Yeah. / * slash error should be 'b'
sd	But now they, they issued a statement about that, about three months ago.
sd	Like they've been laying off a lot of people.
sd	and, they sent out the employee assistance cards for anyone that had any sort of drug problem or work related problem.
sd	Family problems, you know. They kind of covered everything.
sd	But I know they have a lot of drug problems
sd^e	I do.
sd	they talk against drugs
sd	and then they get caught, you know.
sd*	In stings in Washington. / * one utt with a.61
sv	like the money laundering scams. All that was drug related.
sv	and that cost us, the country, you know, billions of dollars.
sd	so I don't really have a lot of experience with air pollution.
sd	But, I know when I lived down in Houston, on the outskirts of Houston, there were some towns like Pasadena that had oil refineries,
sd	And, if you would drive by there, like on your way to the beach or something, there would just be dumping this huge amounts of smoke, into the air
qo	What have you got up there?
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
ba	no.
ba	Sure.
sv	and, and the little bit you say that there putting in here and there, and everywhere, it all adds up. / * there > they're
sd	With all that smoke and,
qh	So it's just, why are we doing this to ourselves .
sd	but, you know, what really amazes me about, like that Pasadena area and the oil refineries, is that there would be houses and people living just really close to it.
sd	I mean, between the freeway and the oil refinery, you would see a neighborhood.
sv	and what comes up, must come down .
sv	and here you are living ...
sv	That just doesn't make too much sense.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
sv	Well, individual companies and things are so selfish,
sv	they don't care about the environmental impact, that they make.
aa	Yes.
qy	Well, have you ever visited, like Los Angeles or any place it's kind of known, that it has, pollution in it's air?
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
qy^d	I guess you've gone that way, maybe.
ba	Pretty funny.
sd	I have relatives that direction.
qy	is it close to Phoenixville, Pennsylvania?
sd	Because I have family there
ba	It's pretty neat.
sd	it's, very lush and pretty, back in the east.
sd	It's really,
no	Well, I'm thirty one.
sv	Seems kind of old to me.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
aa	Yes.
sd	I've heard some people, grumble about their, cars passing their emission tests, and things,
sd	and how it's more expensive and things.
sv	And I thought, well, it's so much better.
b	Huh uh.
qy^d	you don't.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
qh	I mean, well, think about how many automobiles there are.
sd	one of our cars is an older car,
sd	and every time you start it, from the tail pipe, it makes a black spot, on the cement,
sd	And you know that is a sign.
sv	And all cars are doing that.
sv	And it's really polluting the air.
sv	And it's causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer, and things,
sv	We sure wouldn't want, so much more people suffering from that.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
ba	Pretty sad.
ba	no.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
sv	It's scary .
sv	It's scary.
fc	It's helped me to think more about some issues that I need to be thinking more about .
fc	Huh uh.
fc	Thank you.
fc	Bye bye.
sd^t	Miss Nancy, we should be in business now.
qy^t	Did you hear the questions that the lady, brought up?
qw	and how many do you have?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I have two girls and a son,
sd	And my oldest daughter lives in Amsterdam, Holland.
sd	so it's kind of hard for us to visit with them, as much as I'd like to. Because we, one thing we do have together is we're both musicians.
sd	and, she is a, a concert, harpsichordist. And travels around a good bit in Europe.
sd	which are harpsichord size pianos.
sd	And then I have a son who lives in, Warrington, Pennsylvania.
sd	and so they, I don't hardly get to see any of them.
sd	They work, they're really both, people who play on stage
sd	and, they're running lights right now and audio and that thing for, plays and things that go on.
qw	what activities do you do with your children when you are together?
b	Oh.
qy	The Soviet space exhibit?
ba	My goodness.
sv	I am surprised they would bring anything over here.
ba	I'll bet.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that sounds like you have really, wonderful activities that keep you together.
b	Yeah.
o@	Well, that's wonderful. * slash error: should be ba Uh huh. / * slash error, should be 'b'
^g	doesn't it?
ba	Beautiful.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and you seem to be making out all right.
qo	what do you think of the current trends of how other people spend time with their children and so forth?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	of course, I find now that I spend more time with my grandchildren in detail.
qw	Kate, where do you like to eat out?
b	Yes.
qy	Have you tried Mother Mesquites?
sd	That's at Skillman and L B J
sd	it's where Skillman, curves into Forest Lane
sd	Another real good one is, Rafael's down on McKinney Avenue.
sd	They're both very good.
ny	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
^2	El Chico's or El Fenix one,
b	uh huh
sd	Well, I like Tia's better than I do El Chico's or El Fenix.
sd	I like it better than just about anything
sv	and they make very good fajitas there in their own, homemade flour tortillas that are just absolutely wonderful.
sv	Especially with butter and honey on them .
sd	so do I.
qo	Well, what else do you like?
b	Uh huh.
qy	Have you eaten there?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	we like, for the spicy, we like Atchafalaya's out on Belt Line, in Addison
sd	and it's a good restaurant.
sd	for one of the best fish restaurants in town is either Vincent's there in Plano or, I believe it's a Rusty Scupper over on, Dallas Parkway in Addison, which is absolutely wonderful.
sd	They have every kind of fish that you could imagine you'd want
sv	If you want a really special night out and fish food that's a good place to go.
sd	I can remember when our children were small.
sd	and we had a lot of McDonalds when they were first coming out.
sd	I can't look a McDonalds in the face now.
sv	Well, Taco Bueno's good .
b^m^r	and cheap.
ba	Sounds like my grandchildren.
aa	yes.
sd	and it's either T V dinners at home or we go out to eat.
sd	And I would much rather go out to eat than T V dinners .
aa^r	no.
sd	I like breakfast out.
sd	I like the IHOP there in Plano.
b	Oh.
sv	now that's surprising because normally they're real good.
sd	I like because they're, even if they're crowded, they're fast service, you know
sd	don't have to wait forever for a table.
sd	And we also like Owens, country sausa ,
aa	yeah
sd	We think it's good.
sd	It's good.
ny^r	yes.
sd	And we like Applebee's.
sd	I like up there in Plano, that, Country Steak House.
qy	Have you tried it?
sd	and we go for the salad bar.
sd	I know they have a waiting list and a quota on immigration now.
qo	What, What? What all do you know about it?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I don't think there's much of one, because I'm sure all the people from Cuba have been released from that camp that they were in.
sv	And, it's just like Australia, most of them were criminals from Cuba
sv	and I think that was just an attempt that Fidel Castro to undermine, you know the United States to some extent.
sv	And it's almost the same thing in, from Asia, because a lot of them was put out of business in Vietnam after the war,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and a lot of the Mexican people just cross the border during the daytime to come over here and work
sd	I run into people every day that can't speak English.
h	so, So, I don't know,
bf	like you said, I don't know how much they're taking from the work force, you know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and that's, you know, one reason that I did it is because whenever you travel anywhere near the border, you know, there more and more people speak Spanish.
sd	and they're always finding drugs you know, on the most, innocent looking kind of
sd	but a dog found it the other day, you know on the border.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
sd	and one of the things that really gets to me, about the Mexicans is that, once they have children over here, their children are American citizens then.
sd	So, And they, you know, and, and they just follow the rule no matter, you know.
sv	So that doesn't seem fair to the children.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and then they granted them amnesty if they could prove, when was that, it was in the eighties some time if they could prove they'd been here five years.
sd	And, a lot of them had been, you know.
sd	but most of them don't ever want to go back to Mexico,
sd	especially the way it was then.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I think most, you know, like especially the celebrities and everything, well, they have to get a green card if they going to do any kind of work, you know, in movies and such.
sd	But most of them have temporary visas.
sd	but when Rafael Septien took the job with the Cowboys they had to offer his job to any other applicant that could do it.
sd	and that's the thing with the jobs.
sd	And of course no one beat him out.
sd	So, you know. He just ruined his own career,
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
aa	I think so.
sd	Because there are other j , job opportunities, in Europe that there aren't here you know, even,
sd	like orchestra players can find a job sometimes in Europe when they can't find one here.
sd	And I'm a trumpet player.
sd	and I was a music major for a while.
sd	So, so he had to have a work visa there.
sd	And of course they had a lot of musicians from other countries in the Mexico City Symphony.
sd	But I think, like three out of the four other people in the trumpet section are from Mexico now.
sd	But I think I don't know, or one of the conductors is from another country.
sd	It's like any other symphony.
sv	Well, I think we pay too much in taxes.
qo	How about you?
br	Excuse me?
sd	and that particular state had an occupational income tax, but no sales tax.
sd	but it's a heavy sales tax.
sv	So they get you coming and going.
ny	Yeah,
sd(^q)	I said, eight percent. What ?
sv	but it just seems like, if you're strictly middle income, it seems like you get hit the worst.
qy	Is that what you think?
qy^g	Doesn't seem quite fair, does it?
sd	Because they have the money to shelter things
qy^d	I thought you were going to say something.
sd	don't make that kind of money.
h	I don't know.
b	Uh huh.
sd	mean you look at like, that country singer, what's his name, Willie Nelson.
^q*	Why didn't he pay his taxes? You know. / * listen
sv	In a way, it's almost like he had so much debt that, filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it you know.
qrr@	* slash error And do you feel like you get hit by, you know, too much?
sd	so we're in the same kind of,
qy^d	doesn't that sound stupid.
sd*	But, I mean, there's actually less tax implication if I don't work full time compared to what my husband does, you know. / * are the final "you knows" tags?
sd	So it's kind of hard.
br	Excuse me.
aa	Yeah
sd	and if you have kids, you get like seven hundred fifty dollars or something .
bh	it is.
ba	my.
sv	Well that's not too bad.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my goodness.
fc	I guess I better go .
fc	well it was nice talking to you.
qy	Do you have any children?
sv	so I'm going to have difficulty with this topic.
qo	But, what kinds of things do you and your family do?
o@	* slash error should be 'b' Uh huh. / * slash error should be 'b'
ba	That's great.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's great.
sv	I think a lot of families now, they probably don't spend enough time together.
sv	And the communication helps just, just build your family.
ba	to me that's pretty rare.
sd	maybe just even, if we just rent a movie and watch it together just to make sure that everybody's not going out and doing and their her own thing all the time.
sv	But, I don't think you should spend too much time outside at the detriment of losing the family unit.
b	Uh huh.
o@	but, * slash error you know, kids these days are growing up so much faster. / * slash error, should be sv
sv	And once they hit like ten or eleven or twelve, you know, you've pretty much lost them .
qy	So, do you think that your family is pretty rare in that you do a lot of things or just the relationship between you and your daughter?
b	Uh huh.
qo	What kinds of things do you think can?
b@	* slash error I think that's the first thing a lot of people do
sd	first thing I did was turn the TV on. Because I taped the stories from earlier today.
sv	and I think that's another reason why people are, so health conscious now is because America's becoming really a couch potato society.
sv	That's also something, you know, family oriented that everyone can do.
qw	how old is she?
b	yeah.
sv	You've still have a lot of time before she gets up in years .
ba^r	That's good.
fc	Well it was very nice talking to you.
fc	Okay.
qy@	Okay. do you have young children? / * two utts
qy	well, then you are familiar with it?
sd	and I know, well, two of them have gone to preschool.
qo	Why don't you tell me what you have found.
qy^d	You took them to someone's home?
qy	Well, both times?
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
sd	we didn't necessarily have a lot of things ,
o@	and, to have three in day care, you know, even though one of them's in school full time, one of them's, you know, in kindergarten. * need a slash, should be sd ?? That is a lot of money. / * slash err should be sv
sv	I mean it's so expensive.
sv	You have to really make a lot of money.
sd	And I'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate with what's going on in their life.
sv	bosses don't always seem to understand getting off to go to Christmas programs in the middle of the day or something.
sd	and the middle grandson went there as like a preschool thing.
sd	so like, I think he went, well, five mornings a week, if I remember correctly.
sd	you know, starting to learn the colors and learning to associate with children so that when he went to, you know, school and stuff,
sd	it was like a little kindergarten.
sd	They even familiarized the children with computers.
sd	it was really a very excellent one.
sd	He's in kindergarten.
sd	This was last year.
sd	so, you know, it helped him and the first one, he went to a, church preschool that was very good.
sd	The Methodist Church in Richardson.
sd	very good.
bh	does he?
sd	the church ones, church ones seem to be very well run.
bh	really?
sd	I just assumed that most churches, going by, you know experience there, you know, that they were good.
sd	I I didn't know that, you know,
sd	I just know that, you know, First United Methodist of Richardson was just a great program.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	it's a pretty good size church, too, isn't it?
b	Uh huh.
qy	So, Well, are you enjoying staying home?
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Well, isn't it very hard to teach young children and then come home and deal with young children. And have enthusiasm.
sv	if I owned a company and I wanted to make sure that it was run smoothly and that the people that I had, coming in, were trust worthy, et cetera, and so on, I think I would, probably do the random testing just to insure that my company, runs safely and smoothly.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	like for instance, if someone's working on heavy machinery, or say driving trucks or city buses or something like that.
sv	You know, if you're drinking or on drugs or whatever, you're driving a city bus you taking several lives in your hands.
sv	If more and more people are using drugs then I think that some people have to guard against people that are using drugs.
sv	and I think the drug testing is something that the drug users have to cope with.
aap	I think that may be.
qy	You know, what I'm saying?
sd	I don't know what the, you know, limits are.
b	Yeah.
aa	yeah.
b	 Yeah.
sd	just the fact that since I don't use drugs, I have no problem with taking a test.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sv	If you don't have anything to hide, you're not going to mind it.
sv	And then there are some things that just aren't peoples business, that come out at that point
sv	so I think that a lot of people have trouble with that.
b^r	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
aa	Right.
sd(^q)	And I was going, you know, What in the world.
qy	Is that what it was?
bk	okay.
b	Huh uh.
sd^2	Kind of get, Kind of get something to measure my responses by.
b	Yeah.
qy^d@	You know. * slash error But I guess, I don't know, some people have probably killed their mothers.
h	I don't know .
b	Yeah
b	Yeah.
sd	Of course, that was years and years ago.
o@	And * slash error I don't think I mean, there are some people, I mean,
sv	You know, when they might be actually trying to, improve their lives.
b	Huh uh.
b@	Huh uh. * slash error Huh uh.
sd	And I would probably bring something in showing that I had been to such and such hospital for help or, you know, Whatever the twelve month program.
sd	Or whatever it is that they do.
b	Huh uh.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd^t	The other day we had talked about, capital punishment.
sd	I'm kind of, you know, in the middle on that one.
aa	really.
fc	It was very nice talking to you.
fc	Take care.
bh	Do you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I don't think I've ever met a type of music I don't like except for, maybe, you know, heavy metal and that.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	that doesn't appeal to, my ears.
b	Uh huh.
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh .
b	Uh huh.
ba	gosh.
b	Uh huh
ba	sure.
sd	I play guitar for the jazz combo.
sv@	you just can't listen to it for enjoyment * slash error Yeah, unless you're playing it, /* sv
sv	it just doesn't do anything.
sd	My dad is a big blue grass fan,
sd	but, I really do like it a lot.
sd^r	it doesn't.
sv	, they've all got, you know, the real screechy electric guitars now.
b	Yeah.
sd@	I grew up on him. * slash error Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Yeah.
bh	do you?
sv	you sure do.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	they're great aren't they.
b	Yeah.
aa	yeah.
sv	he has a nice smooth voice.
b	sure.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	it was last, last year wasn't it.
sd	Well, ironically enough I'm sitting here with a cast on my leg because I resumed an aerobics class the night before last.
sd	I ripped the ligaments in my right ankle.
b	Yeah
qo	Do you do anything on a regular basis?
sd	I, My husband's a T I er in the unit here.
qy	when you go over there does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged, either at the Dallas location or the Spring Creek, in terms of, it's so much of a weight orientation, weight lifting, et cetera.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Even the Spring Creek one has a lot of weights in it.
qy	Or is that what your into
b	Yeah.
sd	I like the tread mill and the stair master myself over there.
sd	And the pool when it gets warmer.
sd	and then like they had about three feet of linoleum around the perimeter in the back where I usually stand in any class like that I go to.
sd	Instead of having that level, you know they had a chrome strip that wasn't level,
sd	and it was about four inches deep and then about, oh a seventy degree angle.
sd	The orthopedist called it a, basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you, and it snapped.
sd	and he just put a big old cast on it.
sd	for about four weeks.
sd	Well, I like aerobics,
sd	like this orthopedist said, he said you'd be surprised how many people come in here with things like that because they are active.
sd	I guess you could say.
sd	Because I got up and started jumping on it again.
sd	I mean, I like the music and that kind of stuff.
qy	In aerobics?
b	Uh huh.
qy	Did they have to cast it?
bf	so the impact, would not be good.
b	Uh huh.
qy	So, I mean, are you, in terms of other things, like, not running, but playing a little bit of tennis, can you not do stuff like that at all?
b	Yeah.
sd	because I notice in aerobics a lot of the women that don't look like they shouldn't be doing certain things
sv	I'm always afraid they're going to fall over and have a coronary.
sd	and half the time though I don't jump half as much as,
sd	but when you go easy a hundred seventy at my height, I'm five eleven you need just take it easy.
sv	all that pounding all the time.
sd	this was just, I guess, something freak that happened to me,
^q	that's just the way it's constructed.
sd(^q)	I said, who has engineered that? .
qy	one thing that I like, like swimming, you like that a lot?
qr	do you like to exercise because you want to or because you have to?
aa	Yeah.
sd	If I don't do it I just feel like I don't have as much energy.
sv	It curbs the appetite and helps with the calories and all that stuff.
b	Yeah
aa	I know .
sd(^q)	he says, even if you weren't doing anything that would start to happen to you.
sv	maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being.
sv	and they're all like twenty one years of age .
sd	But luckily at there's a little more diverse clientele.
sv	They do intimidate.
sd	but, you know, sometime when I ask, I just feel like, boy, am I stupid or what.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've been there like, maybe a dozen times.
sd	But I actually like that site better than the other one just because of the type people that go to.
sv	sometimes I feel like I'm in a singles bar .
sv	It's not at all anything worth talking about.
sv	but if you don't live near there that's not worth,
sd	Richardson, over on Campbell and Park Hill there's a new recreation center.
sd	great, I have purple tights on, you know.
sd(^q)	but he just said to me, maybe you ought to try bicycling
sd	He told me eight to twelve weeks.
sd	I couldn't, you know adjust that.
sv	You know more about this stuff than I do, obviously then,
qy^d	Well, you're walking okay now obviously,
qo^d	Well, anything else about exercise we can talk about.
sd	I need to go actually get something to eat here.
fc	thank you, Sandy.
qo	Do you have any particular thoughts about the school system?
aa	I agree with you a hundred percent there .
b	Yeah.
sv	and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home.
sd	and other teachers find the same things in this child.
sd(^q)	And, you know, how do you tell the parent, hey, wake up, and smell the coffee .
sv	and I'm not sure just, how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it.
sv	Whether maybe through a commitment of the P T A, and the parents being informed better, that in fact that the problems that are nationwide are problems, of society, and that the school can only do so much on it.
b^r	yeah.
sv	You know what scares me too, is that we have yet to see the biggest effect of the crack children in the school system.
sv	These are children that are born with low attention deficit
sv	That's really scary .
sv	They're behavior problems.
sv	And so, they get put in, in our school system, in a class that's limited for skills children that really have to master skills.
sv	There's no bridge area for students coming out of the E S O L, which is English for Speakers of Other Languages program.
sv	they got thrown right into the total mainstream
sv	and, there really needs to be a bridge, some sort of transition for that.
sv	So the school systems can improve, both in standing up for splitting classes, you know, having learning, slow children in slow classes, but not mixing them with behavior problems.
sv	you get these kids that are average students but highly motivated.
sv	the average classes really are problems because you've got such a mixed bag there.
sd	You know, the gifted and talented are fast classes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I remember I had a college professor who once said that genius is one percent inspiration, and ninety nine percent perspiration.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I guess kids do mature at different ages too.
sd	or is he a problem child.
sv	But teachers are asked to diagnose so much.
sv	but you can't operate in a vacuum.
no	we're in a rather wealthy suburb of Washington.
sd	And a student with a beeper immediately gets sent down to the, principal.
sd	They can't imagine for anything else.
sd	and you refer them to the nurse.
sd	And, so, I mean, you have to find out whether there's a legitimate reason, or whether this is a warning signal.
qh@	And parents frequently resent when you ask them. Is there a problem that we should be aware of? / * 2 utts
b	Uh huh.
sv	and so many parents are facilitators.
sv	I mean, they're manipulated by their children.
sd	I have, a son who's a sophomore in college up in Massachusetts at, Amherst,
sd	They're both national level swimmers,
sd	but, you know, they had to be held accountable too.
sv	but you have to say at what point isn't the help becoming negative.
sv	And I think this is where the school system is suffering, and not through any fault of the effort of the school system.
fc	But gee it was good talking with you.
fc	so there are people throughout the country that feel the same ways that you do, and are connected with the schools.
fc	Uh huh.
fc	Well, we are, though .
fc	Take care,
sd	but my mother's always been administrator of a nursing home
sd	so I've always been involved, you know, in one.
sd	I would personally be the last resort you know, you know if I had to put someone in there.
aa	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd@	Well, I kind of think that's true, too. I guess, because it's so under staffed, you know / * slash error; two utts
sv	that's like everything else, though.
b	Uh huh.
nd	Yeah,
sv	But still there's those little things that happens, you know
sv	I think, it's a wonderful place, you know, if it comes to that, you know, if you just can't take care of them any more.
aa	that's it.
sd	but I think when the time comes, I hope to have the time to really look around, you know and pick one that I really think my mother would be happy at.
sv	Outside's awful deceiving sometimes you know.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sd	and everything you worked so hard for all your life
b	Uh huh.
sd	There's also, you know, some private ones, you know
sd	but of course, I would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that, you know,
sd	that's way out of my reach.
b	yeah.
aa	yeah.
sv	like, they could put it in one of their children's names or something you know.
sv	You know, it's their money.
sd	You know, that's how I feel about it, anyway.
b	Yes.
sd	but she's still on her own, I mean.
sd	and then on the other hand, I've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy you know.
sv	they're not lonely.
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	No.
sd	But I really don't know what the other solution would be you know,
sd	when the time comes hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents
sd	so there's lot of things I know to look for.
sd	And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either you know .
sd	I really don't.
fc	And I guess we'd better get back to work,
fc	Bye bye.
qy^g	up there, maybe you guys don't have as, big a problem with air pollution as many, do you?
bh	Do you really?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	right.
sd	due to the, the emissions, control on the vehicles, seems that all of our, smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd(^q)	I notice people in Dallas seem to say, Well, sure, there's air pollution, but, you know, really, how bad could this problem really be.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qr	or does it come mostly from industry up there?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd^t	So the general topic is hobbies.
ad	Let's hear about your hobbies.
qy	Any handicrafts?
qy^r	Any handicrafts?
sd	So, I think I'm in handicraft.
sd	I think it will become resume writing.
sd	and I'm getting rather good at reading want ads.
b	Yeah,
qh	who knows.
sd	all means about fifteen to twenty percent, of,
sd	so, it's approximately six fifty,
sd	and twenty percent would be one thirty.
aap	that's possible.
ny	yes, .
no	I saw Seven Eleven that was hiring.
ny	Yes.
sd	and, and that has some opportunities
ny	yes.
sd	and, M C I s coming if, telemarketing is your bag.
sd	Personally I'd rather die a slow painful death
sd	I'm, government tool control specialist.
qy	Are you still employed?
b	Oh.
qr	Exempt or ?
bk	yes.
qy^d	so, you didn't even get the severance package.
qy	So, are you happy with what you are doing now?
b	Yeah.
sd	or I, I'm significantly shaken by the situation, but not devastated.
sd	To tell you the truth, I'm, I'm not really worried.
sd	and I seem rather happy about it most of the time, just to know, what's, possibilities are, you know, what might happen.
sd	But still in all, it feels funny.
sd	So, despite the fact that I should be tying flies or fly fishing or going for walks in the mountains, I can't seem to get into it right now.
sd	I doubt I'll be here in six months.
na	all things being equal, yes.
sd^e	or, or even somewhere better,
sv	but, God this is much better than west Texas.
sd	But then they tell me Hell is much better than west Texas.
sd	my little brother lives in Austin right now.
sd	Goes to U T.
sd	For the last many years I've more or less let them direct what I want to do, and where I want to go. And just kind of go with the punches.
sd	And now I feel lost.
no	I had job offers.
sd	But, I never found the one that was worth it for me to leave.
qy	so, had you been with T I long when you changed?
sv@	Well, there's a noticeable difference there. / * two utts?
sd	I've been with them sixteen.
sv	momentum is, driving force in our lives.
sd	I'm looking as a opportunity.
sd	and I'm looking at it as a change.
sd	And I'm looking at it as an adventure.
qy	how about we end this?
fc	Nice talking to you.
fc	Bye.
sd	guess we got our first, credit card, back in the early seventies when, I first got married
sd	was a Visa card. issued out of a Liberty Bank in Oklahoma City,
sd	because my sister worked at the some Bank Americard center there. / * one utt with a.3 utt2?
sd	They've come in handy over the years.
sd	and they have become, also a real bother sometimes.
sv	Especially, you know, if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation, it's just easier to put everything on a card.
sv	and it adds up.
sd	So, sometimes, especially traveling with T I, you know, everything goes on American Express,
sd	and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping.
sd	I kind of like having them for, gasoline purchases.
sd	But other than that, I guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome, of just putting everything on there day after day after day
sv	and then, then you really get socked to it, if you don't watch it.
qo	how do you look at counting credit cards?
b	Right.
sd	Well, that's kind of the way we were doing
sd	well, if you got a bunch of cards, you get a bunch of bills every month
sv	and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid.
sd	Sometimes, it's twenty two percent interest.
sd	I guess that's one of the motivations behind the, the, the, American Express card with T I,
sd	with the American Express card from T I, there's no, late fee,
sd	there's no, interest rate,
sv	So, they've got quite a bit more motivation I think to get paid then, some of the others do.
sd	But that's the one that your call center manager sees every month,
ny	yeah.
sd^e	You can use it like any other card,
sd	and, but, you know, you kind of, you know that somebody every month,
sd	and who knows how many people, are looking at those, bills that come in, and those statements,
sd	you're not the only one.
sd	is that okay, that those people see what it is that you are buying,
sd	I've got three card offers now, from gas companies and, Visa Gold and, some, , other bank,
sd	And I usually just throw them away because I, I don't want another one,
sd	You know you carry around a wallet full of credit cards,
sd	and, one of these days it's going to all be full.
ba	that's not bad.
sd	if they don't say, no annual membership on them, I'll throw them away.
sd	and I said, adios, you know, I'm not paying you,
sv	It's just another way to make money, as far as I can tell.
sv	they're going to get cards at twenty bucks a pop.
sv	There's going to be that much more.
sd	so, then a couple years ago I found, a bank here in Plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was, you can get a Visa card through them and no annual membership.
sd	so, as long as they have no annual membership fee, it would be okay,
sv	but I can't see paying someone to use their card.
sv	Be charged their eighteen percent interest,
sv	The best philosophy is have them if you need them, but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere.
b	Yeah.
fc	Thanks for talking.
fc	Bye.
sd^t	but, I've been trying all different times,
sd(^q)^t	so thought, I'll try ,
b	Oh .
sd	so I'm home certain days,
sd^t	and, I really haven't been making any phone calls, have you?
qy	have you received many?
b	Yeah.
sd^t	well, the first time we were on this it came just about every day.
sd^t	They just always came .
qo	what do you think? .
sv	I think it might be good for them.
sv	But as a mother of two daughters I might be afraid of where they were sent.
sd	I'm just concerned about their safety
sv	because if they do good work in America they'll probably be sent to a ghetto .
sd	And if they were sent to a third world country I couldn't help but wait worried, you know.
sd	That, that would be my main objection.
sv	it will probably never happen
sv	well it probably won't.
sv	We can't, seem to pay for all the little things we have going now .
sv	That's another consideration .
sv	it might be a real eye opener, you know .
sd	they're just kind of shocked at that side of town, you know .
sd	I probably lived in one of those when I was a little girl .
qy^g	Well that would be an eye opener, wouldn't it?
sd	I mean right next to us is such a pitiful country.
sd	Sometimes I wish we'd help them out instead of going all across the world, and helping some countries I never even heard of.
sv	it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country. Right on our borders.
qy	you're in Lewisville.
sd	It looked really nice.
sd	It looked like a sight.
aa	Sure.
sd	Well, my husband works at T I over on Central.
sd^t	we did it last time.
sd^t	they didn't even ask him back .
sd^t	But like I said I hardly ever get any calls this time.
sd^t	And I can never find anybody.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd^t	I've had the same experiences,
sd^t	all right around here.
sv	there's so many with this one town you know.
sv	even in some families some people talk a little bit different.
sv	Of course, I think everybody in New Jersey sounds a little bit funny
o	You know, how that goes .
sd	Sometimes she says at night. or switc , or overloads
^q	so please end your conversation.
qy	Well, do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject? .
qy	You don't have any kids you want to send over here? .
sd	she might .
sd	but, for all practical purposes, I guess we hold the mortgage .
b	right.
sd	No one else has offered to pay for it.
sd	really they could move right into the spare room .
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah,
bf	five years ago.
b	Yeah,
sv	I mean just recently, I would say, I would give it two years back, when it was, I think, bottomed out.
sd	see, it was just different areas,
sv	That's a really nice area.
qy^d	It's still considered Garland.
b	yeah.
ad	Write that one down.
sd	It sounded good to me .
b	Right.
b	okay.
ba	no.
ba	gee.
sd	I, kept thinking of Omar Sharif every time I saw that name somewhere,
ba	wow.
b	Right.
ba	great.
sv	Probably eighty.
b^m	Sixty, eighty.
sv	so, I think the high end is definitely, you know somewhere there .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
br	the ones that look like brick houses ?
sd	I just see him as trying to squish you know, as much house into the space as possible.
b	Yeah.
sd	And we thought that was important instead of getting swallowed up in something that you know.
aa	that's true.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sd	They are putting in a deck, a redwood deck,
sd	and it's just, they are doing such a fine, fine job.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Great.
b	Yeah.
bf^2	Looks like the George Town brownstone .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	I can't ,
sv	He has no insulation, probably.
ba	my.
bh	What a trap.
b	Yeah.
sd	I do too.
"	and you have to stop everything to run to the phone.
sd	and invariably just about the time, I'm going to sleep, the phone tears off the wall.
sd	as soon as you say hello, you hear the click of the recording coming on,
sd	or you hear somebody all ready starting, reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already.
sd	and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything.
sd	What I would love to see done to stop all of this,
sd	you can have your phone number unlisted,
sv	but if they're going to offer these services, or these recorded message, everything, they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them.
sd	or I would have called for their salesman to come out.
sd	otherwise, I don't want to know they exist.
sv	I guess I should make another one that says religious or otherwise, cause I still get,
sd	it would be harassment.
sv	But, I consider an invasion of my privacy, a harassment in itself.
sv	I believe we've pretty much summed everything up.
^h	I'm drawing a blank.
na^t	pretty close to it.
fc	Well I've enjoyed talking with you.
fc	And take it easy now.
sd	but the humidity has hung around all of June.
sd^e	I grew up in Michigan,
sd	but, you know, I know the summers get hot
sd	this humidity has just really hung on there.
aa	Yes.
sd	You get those great big cracks in the ground where it's been so dry
sd	I can remember the first year I moved here
sd	it was just wonderful.
b	yeah.
aa^r	that's right.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
sd	I grew up in Dearborn which is a suburb of Detroit.
sv	You probably know where that is because I know where Pontiac is,
sd	a teaching job.
sd	So, I'm home with two children,
sd	New career. New career
sd	and, that's how it worked out.
b	yeah.
sv	I mean it's a nice, that's a nice place, though.
h	sort of.
b	Yeah.
sd	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
sd	but that's the only one I probably could name after all these years
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
qy	and isn't that where they have a summer music festival there, too?
sd	we didn't do a lot of it,
sd	And Alpine, was it Alpine was another ski slope that we went to,
sd	my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on, you know, make a pond in the backyard for us.
sd	and, you know, it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
sv	If only it would make nice snow here in Texas, we'd be okay at Christmas time.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	I know.
sd	I mean they just go down the ice.
sd	I think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there.
sv	and especially in this election year, I think that, there ought to be at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this.
sv	 especially what, for instance, George Bush is offering.
sv	that's really not going to do a lot of good, it doesn't seem to me, to your average middle income person, you know.
sd	hell you can buy a coke or something for that.
b	Yeah.
sd	That ninety seven cents really isn't going to do it for me either.
sv	especially the Democratic candidates don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah, maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point.
sv	I believe it was Dukakis
^q	I will not
^q@	read my lips, or whatever * slash error and then, you know, ten months later he said, well, sorry, you know, I, I can't follow through on this. / * sd(^q
sv	and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of, you know of X number of billion, trillion dollars a year.
sv	because, in my opinion, I don't think I'm ever going to see any of this so called peace dividend.
sv	I'm not really in favor of large government social programs, either, because I feel that they waste money, also,
sv	but with this peace dividend, it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works projects like they had in the thirties, or whatever.
aa	ex , Exactly
sv	and in that way we could really focus on building the infra structure of the country.
sd	and I surely don't hear anybody saying that right now.
sd	So am I.
sd	I U.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sv	you just have to wonder what they're thinking in Washington.
sd	I mean they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year,
sv	and they, in my opinion, don't do a very responsible job of spending that money.
ba@	no. * slash error Uh huh. / * b
sd(^q)	and that's what really is getting me about what George Bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying, I am going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come November, and you'll elect me again
^q	and then I'm going to go on and just forget everything that I said
sv	or you know, it doesn't seem that it's going to make much of a difference.
aa	not at all.
fp	and I'm calling from Plano, Texas.
sd	so they keep me pretty busy.
t3	And yourself.
sd	Well, my husband swims every day at lunch, which he loves doing
sd	but then maybe he'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run.
sv	so we need to keep exercising just to be able to,
aa	I know.
sd	And it's kind of another day out for her to, have little friends,
sd	getting to see the same women every morning,
sd(^q)	but there are some parts during that exercise that I think, I cannot do another second of this.
aa	It is.
o	Okay, well.
fc	thank you for participating.
fc	Bye.
qo	What have you seen?
sd	I want to go see that.
ba	Gosh.
sd	I was hoping he was going to get Best Actor.
sv	but he, he did pretty good on that one.
b	Yeah.
sd	 DANCES. SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
ar	Nay.
sd	That's what people said,
b	Yeah.
sd	we laughed about it .
sd	well I, I guess it was because I'd read the book before I saw the movie.
sd	And the book, to me, was far more frightening than the movie was.
sv	and he had a way of putting you in that scene, you know.
sd	You start hearing noises you know.
sd	And there's rats in the attic, you know.
sd	and I can't remember,
sd	I didn't, I didn't even like the previews on that.
sd	I don't much care for Michael J Fox anyway.
sd	I hardly ever go see a sequel.
sd	I mean, I think the only I've ever seen a sequel was TWO THOUSAND AND ONE.
sv	TWO THOUSAND AND TEN was far better.
sv	TWO THOUSAND AND ONE was a good movie if you had read the book.
sv	I mean the book was so much,
sv	You can't put it in pictures.
qh	You know, what's the significance of the apes, you know .
sd	and that's one of them.
sv	it's so well written.
sd	I haven't .
qy	a real dog and cat?
sd	sounds sort of like the incredible journey.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Sounds a lot a like a Walt Disney film.
sd	I mean, I, I was raised on Walt Disney films. You know.
sd	OLD YELLER. BIG RED.
sd	and it was so good that I had forgotten that it was Christmas Eve.
sv	I mean that's something for a kid.
sd	And that was something for greedy old me at Christmas time, I'll tell you.
nn	No .
bh	Is it?
sd	I didn't much care for the first one.
co	Well, I'll have to go get that one I guess.
sd	Number nine, number ten, number fourteen.
aa^r	Yeah, you know.
sd	I I haven't seen a one.
sd	I can't stand Stallone.
sd	And I was afraid that RAMBO was going to do the same thing that ROCKY was going to do, you know. Go into fourteen hundred episodes.
sd	If I ever get the hankering to see something, I've got, I don't know, maybe about thirty or forty movies
sd	I don't even rent them. You know.
sd	Cause I just watch them over and over again.
b	Yeah.
sd	my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is, EXCALIBUR.
sv	it's just so well done.
sd	And I lived over in England for four years,
sd	That was the first place I ever saw it.
sv	it was so good.
sd	And they got pretty scenery in Ireland.
sd	it's nice.
sd	And I've been down to the south of England where supposedly King Arthur's castle was.
sd	I mean, the whole thing was about the size of a medium house .
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	There's some nice stuff over there to see.
sd	I spent four years traveling around and didn't see, you know, hardly anything.
sd	I need, to go over there and stay about twenty years so I can just travel. Go around all the places.
sv	everybody makes the obligatory trip to Stonehenge.
sv	It's boring.
sd	come to think of it, I don't think I went to the movies one time.
sd	where I lived. it was a little town called Newmarket. About seventy miles north of London.
sd	And there was another town called Barry Saint Edmunds about twenty miles away from us.
sd	and we use to go out to that about once a week.
sd	You know, amateurs but really quite good.
sd	Course go to London quite a lot and see shows down there.
sd	but other than that I just didn't have time to go to the movies, you know.
sd	I rented a lot of videos .
sv	and who wants who wants to drive twenty miles to go to the movies .
sd	a lot of people did.
sd	But it would have to be a good show.
b	Yeah.
sv	they, they have all these neat phrases. You know, you know, you know. Like critically acclaimed.
sv	That's what they when the thing hasn't won any award. / * listen
sv	from Love Canal .
sv	Waterfront property here at Love Canal, you know.
sd	I mean, there's a lot of reasons why I don't go to movies.
sv	I mean, you know, you can't live in Dallas without, you know,
sd	see I have a tendency to, adopt teams when I go to a tea , go to a town.
sd	so I mean, you know, I've got quite a few.
sd	but I don't get into, you know, how many errors somebody has or things like that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I've heard of that one.
ba	that's supposed to be a real good statistic,
sv	they don't have the offense to get out, or to have the more runs,
b	Uh huh.
aap	Which I was kind of leaning toward anyway, to tell you the truth.
sd	plus supposedly what I heard, he was not much of a team player anyway,
b	Uh huh.
aa	well that's true.
b	Right.
sd	Now having somebody get up and hit a solo home run you know, gives you run, obviously.
sv	you've got to be able to get the two and three run home runs, you know, to be able to, score enough runs to be able to win in this day and age,
sv	you know, so he's very much due for a good year.
sd	They could very easily, take that as a challenge. Which is the way most teams you know, naturally do. and, just go out and not give anybody a chance to beat them,
sv	baseball is there life up there like football is down here I think.
ny	yeah.
sv	I think that's all that they have.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and they're like one of the best teams in spring training so far.
sd	so, you know, it's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just, you know, come out and just won all kinds of games in Spring training and then gone on a, you know, fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season
aa	yeah.
sv	You can't.
sv	I think the best thing that you can do is go with, the players that have the talent to do the best years. And, that they hadn't had these, gigantic, career years yet and, and just kind of assume that, you know, one of them is going to break through eventually,
sv	this last year, I'm not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years.
sv	You know, and so they may be even better this year.
sv	They're letting their farm system, build up and stuff like that
b	Uh huh.
nn	No.
aap	that's probably true.
sv	Don't let him go away.
sv	And I think that's really what's been hurting, the, Rangers.
sv	so it's like I said spending money doesn't guarantee you, winning a pennant.
sv	It really doesn't,
sv	and once you do that, you lose everything,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	There are so many games in a year that they've got to have repeat customers.
sd	and yet they attract as many if not more than most, other cities,
qy	Well, do you exercise regularly?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Oh. That is good.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I use to also take an aerobics class about three days a week before work.
sd	But, I guess my job change, my husband's job change and it is just not easy to get up early in the morning any more.
sd	I just want to go home and not do anything.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	That is a .
sd	but, you know by the time I get over the gym and go for my class and shower and get back to work, it is probably two hours or more
sv	and that is just too long.
b	Yeah .
qh	That doesn't really do it, does it?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa^r	That is right.
ba	Well, that is not much.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That is not bad.
ba	That is for sure.
sv	They are real expensive.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd@	and its probably about a hundred and fifty dollars a year. Which is bad. / * 2 utts
sd	if its only walk the dog or something.
sd	I need to start doing that.
aa	That is right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think it's, refreshing to see the support that the President got from the American people.
aa	Right.
aa	Yes.
aa	That's right .
b	Really.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	if you remember, the vote in the Congress to authorize war, if necessary, was actually pretty close.
sv	And if my memory serves me right, I believe a majority of Democrats may even have opposed it,
aa	That's right.
sv(^q)	Especially the ones that came out and said, oh come on guys, let's talk about this little while longer.
qh	and what do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time.
aa	No doubt.
aa	I think so too.
sv	Well they were, and in fact they were so well dug in that, when we sent our tanks around behind them they couldn't get turned around in time.
sv	Well, had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor.
ba	interesting.
sv	Well, Baker is really not very much pro Israel.
qy	And did you know John Sununu is, half Arab?
b	Yeah.
sv	in fact, when he was Governor of New Hampshire, I believe.
sv	I believe he was the only one of fifty governors that voted against some kind of resolution of support for Israel a few years back.
sd	and that concerns me greatly.
sv	they could either fight or die.
sv(^q)	however, every time an organization such as the P L O says well we'll see if we can work with Israel, then, they get embarrassed every few months by documents that reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them.
sv	and I'm just not sure that there's going to be any easy permanent solution.
aa	Exactly.
aa	It is.
sd	I commend Israel for their restraint in not responding to the Scud attacks.
aa	exactly.
aa	No.
fc	Well it's been fun, I enjoyed talking with you.
fc	You never know.
fc	Bye, bye.
sd	we're energized.
sd	painting is not hard to do, as long as it's not to the point of where it needs to be scraped and peeling,
sd	so I'm looking for the easy way out.
sd	but you have to be aware of how messy they can get and are they going to put on a good two coats, and are they, going to caulk,
sd	Exterior.
sv	interior's not so bad because it's more fun,
sd	outside you have high peeks, and those kind of things,
sv	it can be a real issue.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And, I've had thirteen hundred dollar bid and as low as five hundred and forty dollars
sd	and I'm so much worried about that as what, I don't want it all over the brick and windows
ba	sure.
qy^d	So y'all, you haven't had any jobs painted in your house recently .
ba	That's fun.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's not very,
bf	they just painted over varnished wood.
ba	my,
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
ba	no.
fc	I wish you good luck.
fc	Thank you very much.
fc	Bye bye.
qy	Cindy, have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES?
na	that is a wonderful movie.
nn	No.
bh	Really.
sd	I thought it was great.
ny	Yeah.
sd	and I heard a story about there's a certain scene in the movie where they're, they're on a buffalo hunt.
sd	And they have a particular child actor, who's being supposedly run down by a buffalo.
sd	And when they were trying to film that, the buffalo that they used for that scene was Neil Young's buffalo.
sd	But he has a fetish for Oreo cookies.
sd	And he got him to run like he was running down the kid by luring him with oreo cookies .
sd	I thought that was really funny.
bk	yeah.
bk	yeah.
sd	the wagon driver.
sv	And, the costuming * slash error yeah, was, / * slash error
sd	the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that, that, the Indians all appeared to be wearing new things.
sv	And they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably to age the material
sd	so, they did very authentic reproductions of the, of the actual stuff,
sv	but they didn't age it quite enough it seemed.
sv	But it was a very good movie.
qw	What have you seen lately?
sd	I didn't see that.
sd	I don't like Stephen King.
bh	Really.
sv	because, just generally, you know, that kind of scary stuff I just don't want to have anything to do with it.
sv	I think I heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something, you know.
ba	Ugh.
b	Yeah.
sv	It still just seems a little twisted to me .
sv	I'm not sure I would have enjoyed that at all.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	yeah.
sd	we don't see movies at the movies a lot.
sd	and then we rent them .
sv	that looks really good too.
sd	but I'm not sure I want to go see it yet .
sd	and they said it was okay.
sd	I think they may be playing up some aspects of the movie that aren't the main aspects.
sd	Now, we went to see the JAGGED EDGE.
bh	Yeah.
sv	So, it seems like, you know, that kind of thriller suspense and not real, strange in other ways.
fc	Maybe we'll talk to you again.
fc	Alright.
sd	Well, I am basically retired now.
sd	I was in education and in administration,
sd@	so basically I wore dresses. * slash... And, heels,
sd	and I because my work often took me into court, never was one that got, accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work.
sd	I guess I was just old enough not to, be very comfortable in it.
qo	How about you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	because when you do have to be in front of people, I think the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and, more classical style of clothing.
qw	What about the mini skirt?
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well there are mini skirts and there are mini skirts.
sv	and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee.
sv	and again it depends upon the size, the shape of the person, as well as the shape of the person's legs.
sd	and I teach at a modeling agency here.
sd	so, when we are doing wardrobing and we have, two hour classes in wardrobe, we do discuss a great deal, the mini skirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job.
sd	even though I may have them from sixth grade on up through, grandmothers, in my class.
sd	And, I always try to emphasize the, clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad,
sv	because maybe those are not the clothes that are the most, appealing to you, or the most, complimentary to you.
sv	But, the mini skirt many times will evoke comments you don't really want.
sv	and then you're in the situation where you're very unhappy.
aa	That's right.
sd	Well, I, I have to, agree with that, even when they was very, very popular in the early sixties,
sd	again maybe because I was at the school, there were still many teachers who wore mini skirts,
sd	and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers.
sd	Because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts.
sv	And so, I think, of course, now I go the other extreme, I do not like to see, in the corporate areas, all the women dressed like men, with the suits and, white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same.
sv	I think there should be individuality in dressing.
aa	Yes.
aa	Right.
sv	and I don't think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to look professional.
sv	and you can go the opposite direction and, over do all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you, which don't belong in, at least in my opinion, in the work place,
sv	you can have a classical look without a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine.
sd	I started out as a physical education teacher.
sd	So I was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or manish,
sd	and that pleased me,
sd	but when I go out somewhere, then, unless I have a pair of dress slacks, I don't usually wear a lot of blue jeans.
sd	I have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how.
sv	And, so, I just feel that, you know each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort.
sv	But, there are certain norms that companies should be able to, put out as guidelines for their employees.
b	Yes.
ba	That's good.
b	uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Right.
b^r	right.
b	Yeah.
sd	Fortunately I don't have to work in those companies .
sd@	I mean you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants. * need slash And one was a skirt and one was a pant. / * sd
sv	and I think that's sad because that doesn't allow for any individuality.
sv	That can stifle creativity.
fc	well it's been nice talking with you.
fc	bye, bye.
qy^t	is that it?
sd^t	well, I guess we have to talk about magazines
sd	And now I, subscribe to, LADIES HOME JOURNAL.
qy	are you interested in computers?
sd	You know, if I want something intellectual, I usually read a book.
aa	they did.
b	Yeah.
sd	I don't know if they're around anymore.
sd	it was Publisher's Clearinghouse ,
sd	They told me, you know, if I didn't subscribe they were going to take me off their winning, you know, their list .
sd	so I figured, hey, look . For twelve dollars, you know,
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	You know, well, you don't have to concentrate, you know you know.
qy	or isn't it similar to the TV GUIDE?
bk	I see.
b	uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd	if I read three articles in, you know, one of the JOURNALs, I figure, you know, I did really well.
sd	you know, I don't, I'm not into, you know, recipes
sd	so, you know, that eliminates, like three quarters of the magazine . You know.
qy^g	what does it have, it has a death penalty doesn't it?
sv	But now it's coming back into favor.
h	I don't know maybe if I went back and took a sociology class now they'd say it is a deterrent.
sd	because that was back in the seventies.
sd	I think they have they're working on, something in Austin now,
sd	I just remember seeing a, kind of a synopsis of it.
sd	Well, I'm personally very in favor of it.
qh	why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after they've mowed down a class yard full of kids or tried to, or you know, given their best effort at doing that.
sd	I don't care to support them.
aa	Sure.
b^r	uh huh .
sd	And she was set free, too, just in two examples in Texas recently.
qh	what if we make a mistake.
sv	And that's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything.
sd	Well, Well, I guess, though, where I would have a problem with it if I were on the jury that, put, that handed down the death sentence because it was my judgement the person's guilty.
sv	But to be the actual one of the ones that decide, that would be tougher for me.
h	but I don't know .
sv	but, you know, that's what they did.
sv	Or rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted.
sv	And they wanted something more than they respect the human life.
sv	I think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance.
sd	it is.
sd	and maybe, now, I don't remember if this is Texas or not, that has something about all drug dealers can be sentenced to the death sentence.
sd	Convicted drug dealers.
sd	they're on the distribution end.
sd	It's for the large dealers is what, it's reserved for.
sd	And they are in effect killing people.
bk	okay.
qr	or is it passed?
sd	I believe it is,
aa	And I have to agree with that.
sd	but to the best of my knowledge we haven't had a major problem yet.
sv@	But it just touches so many young people. * slash error * slash error Well, my children are about in the same age bracket.
sd	So, it's the same age bracket.
sd	And I think one of each experimented very slightly with pot,
sd	and I think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge.
ba	that's tough.
sd	and he's concerned about it but, hasn't quite made it yet .
sd	I've seen all of this,
sd	so, when we're invited to people's house, he will not smoke in their house. Which I think is good because there's a lot of people that are very,
sd	particularly if they have children.
sd	but still , he's done everything the Smokers Anonymous tell you to do except quit smoking .
sv	It's a, long process.
ba	how neat.
sd	and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening.
sv	and I, I feel like it went on and on.
sd	And I guess I see such a contrast like as opposed to the Middle East War we just had, where President Bush went out and got worldwide support for what was happening.
sv	and I'm not sure that's our role,
b	Uh huh.
sv	but I feel like maybe the American people and the government are aware of the things that we did wrong that we didn't support that , that those,
sd	and those guys were there doing their duty.
sv	It was a tragic mistake,
sv	and I'm not sure you can undo the damage that was done emotionally, on so many of the people.
aa	they're not.
b	Yeah.
sd	He went over there to get them out of Kuwait, which he did.
sv	And you see, I think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another Vietnam situation.
sv	I don't think he would do that,
sv	I think we learned too much of the effects.
sv	I feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing to try and help maintain the democracy over there and, and beat the communism,
sv	but I think somewhere that got lost. You know, in the long term effects of the war
b	Yeah.
bf	That we don't get fixed.
aa	I know.
sv	and I believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us.
sv	But I also believe that we need to turn so much of that inward.
sv	I think that maybe a lot of the Arab countries that were so hateful towards the United States have come away with, kind of a different attitude.
sv	I think that maybe we're not their big bad enemy any more.
sv	and I think that's good, you know,
sv	I think that's a good,
aa	I think so too.
sv	And perhaps the reason that good came out of the Mid East war is because we had the experience of Vietnam.
sv	So, I, I do think that, we've learned from it,
sd	you know, I, I wish there weren't war .
sv	But, I do think we learned.
aa	Yes.
aa	no,
qh	Who knows.
sd	like right now, I feel like this country has been behind this war.
sd	I'm not for war,
sd	I don't remember that feeling back in Vietnam.
sd(^q)	but there was no, let's support them, you know.
b	Yeah.
aa@	That's right. * slash error That's right.
aa	That's right.
sv	They don't see it as supporting the folks, the people.
aa	I would agree with you there .
sd	And I remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that.
aa	That's true.
sd	Giving a soapbox to stand on .
sd	I'm sorry we had the experience of Vietnam.
sv	because, you know until the past four or five years, nobody ever really worried about that, for them.
sv	and I think that's where we as American people really you know, failed them.
qy	Well, do you have anything else you want to say on this?
sd	but this is something to me that's sad .
fc	and I appreciate the conversation.
fc	Bye bye.
o	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	the, the way, you know, the, the, the lifestyle pictured in the catalogs isn't always the whole story.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I go to Georgia Tech which is, you know, primarily an engineering school
sv	and there doesn't seem to be the diversity of views that a lot of, you know, universities will have.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	actually I'm, I'm more interested in, in choosing the right job when you graduate type information .
b	Uh huh.
^2	Program.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh uh.
^2	like a fine arts education,
sv	and, it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way, you know, in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other, just like everyone who did vote, it's not clear to me that it is really a problem,
sd	In fact I've heard of studies that suggest that that isn't.
sd	and, wish I could vote on more things frankly.
sd	I mean, we have these state initiatives now.
sd	The first really you know wide spread one was, Proposition Thirteen which was a, tax revolt, against property taxes.
sv	you know, that's, that's why we hire people you know, to make these decisions for us.
b	Yeah.
aa	I do t ,
sd	I wouldn't mind having, more votes than I get to have, frankly .
sd	it is in Australia, for example.
aa^r	yeah.
sd	I don't know how I feel about that.
sd	Well Australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the United States.
h	And it's not for me to say that they're not.
sd	we have the duty to pay taxes.
h	 I don't know,
sd	but part of me rebels against that,
sd	but you're eligible for some sort of fine if you don't vote.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sv	but if you don't vote, part of me, and it's kind of a nasty part of me feels like, well if you didn't vote, you get what's coming to you, you know.
sv	And, you know, I say well, you know, voting for the lesser of two evils is still important.
sv	But of course that's not really a vote.
sd	I mean, not because of the vo , I mean I'm not thinking of moving there because of the voting, but just because of a job opportunity.
sd^e	I'm not.
sd	and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty,
b^r	uh huh.
h	I don't know.
sv	that's considered a privilege, not a right.
sv	But actually it's a privilege, which is allowed to be revoked.
sv	And, fortunately voting isn't that.
sd	if you're a felon it is taken away from you.
sd	I mean, they will take away your right to vote, under certain circumstances.
sv^t	so we don't have a great solution yet do we ,
qy^d	But I also, I also, I don't know if you've, read any of what do they call those. The, the early republic documents, when they were arguing through constitutional law written by Hamilton and all those people.
sd	I think it was Hamilton who wrote number ten or something, where he was arguing for a republican, not in the sense of the Republican party now, versus a democratic, government and, arguing successfully, why, the United States should be a republic, not a democracy. Which indeed it really is, a republic, not a democracy.
sd	In other words, you vote for representatives.
sd	if there's some minority that people don't like because of, you know, racial hatred or something like that, the majority can just simply vote against them.
sd	and actually I agree, except that I don't trust the people who are appointed to vote .
sd	well, I mean, I feel that wa ,
sv	that kind of thing.
o	All right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I wish I had.
sd	and it started falling.
sd	and finally, boom .
ny	Yep.
sd	And, so, there I was in old bankruptcy court.
ny	yeah.
sd	and, you know, they take payment any way they can get it.
sd	but it was things like, you know, rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	That's the way they suck you in.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, just today in the mail I got, got my guaranteed acceptance by, American Express.
b	Yeah.
sv	as soon as you're a graduate student they get your name.
sd	back when I had my business I got one.
sd	because I was using the American Express strictly for the travel expenses.
sd(^q)	So I made a copy of the check that they had cashed attached it to their letter, and sent them a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces, saying Thanks, but no thanks .
sd	They don't talk about they're charging that enormous fee every year.
ar	no
sd^e	for the green card.
sd	Well, now, that's the card, see.
sd	it's about sixteen and a half percent, which is pretty good, as far as credit cards go.
sv	Well, they're dangerous.
sd	and that's it.
aa	Yeah.
sd	now I do use gas cards.
b	Yeah,
sv	I mean that's the whole problem with it.
b	Yeah.
sd	I got into all kinds of trouble doing that .
sd	but, I, I'm kind of, grateful for the experience because it's taught me a lot of restraint.
sd	I, I just went out and got a new V C R yesterday with cash.
sd^e	I wish I did.
sd	I have to wait for things to go on sale .
sv	especially on electronic goods
sv	especially now.
bc	Circuit City.
sd	but they've got to pay for all that national advertising now.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	We call it Service Merchandise.
qy^d	You got Service Merchandise.
sv	So much for Circuit City.
sd	I'm a professional student.
aa	It is.
sv	It's great.
sd	I love it.
sd	N C State.
sd	North Carolina State.
sd^e	ours doesn't start until, next week.
br	Where am I?
sd	in Raleigh.
sd	What a dead place .
sd	and I sit around and tinker with that most of the time.
sd	human factors.
sd	Not a thing .
sd	it's really looking at systems and design systems and seeing how people interact with them.
sd	my master's is in industrial engineering.
ny	Yeah.
sd	P H D in human factors.
nd	Well,
sd	but I B M is what I'm looking at right now.
sd	but not at the human factors level .
o@	me. * slash error I'm, I'm or going into the, dissertation this summer. / * sd
sd^e	I probably won't finish it until the end of the year
sd	but, I'm trying to get a, intern position with I B M right now so that I can find an area to do my dissertation in.
sd	It's hard finding an area to do a dissertation in this field.
qy	so do you have a personal computer?
b	Oh .
sd	and that was six years ago,
sd	my sister bought it
sd	and he never did,
sd	He only had three employees,
sv	so, you know, it wasn't really worth it to him to do it.
sv	like pay, the payroll
b	Yeah.
sd	It's an, I B M P C Junior, I think.
sd@	and my father wasn't using it, * slash error She took it with her, * sd because she needed it to do,
sd	she just finished up her Bachelor's degree
sd	so I don't know if she's going to even use it anymore.
b	Yeah.
ba	that's, a very good use.
sv	but it's just you have, to have a need.
sd	I really have no need for it at all,
sd	I work for Digital Equipment
sd	and we have a powerful computer down at work.
sd	and I, I still really don't do that much, as you say, play games on it ,
sv	they're great for playing games.
b	Yeah.
sd	they just went through a course, and took the electronic grafting course, drafting, not grafting, but drafting course,
sd	the C A D.
sd	you can do graphs on it too,
sd	but it's actual, drafting,
sv	and the computer does it all for you.
sd	but my boss wouldn't pay for it,
^q	I'll be needed.
sd	because I didn't think I was really going to use it.
sd	I've got a cold because it was eighty degrees up here and I went outside with no coat on.
sd	it was bad.
sd^e	was a big change.
sd	and then, again, I picked up a cold.
sd	But I'm doing all right, getting over it.
sd	So I don't even know how much, personal computers cost nowadays.
bf	they can't do your, your drafting and your graphs, and all of that.
bh	Yeah?
qy	You do run in , you do run into limitations on yours?
ba	wow.
b	Yeah.
sd	I haven't even begun to reach the limits,
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	They, say that Commodore has made a good, P C for the price, though.
sd	she's not going to do it, not going to use it.
sv(^q)	but like I say, she could have bought a much cheaper model and done what she wanted.
sv	a typewriter with memory would have been fine,
sd	it's all she uses it for.
sd	I'm not sure.
b	Yeah,
sv	that's the one great thing about it .
sd	it was six years ago.
sd	and all you have to do is just put it in the spelling check mode,
sd	And I don't even have to look my words up anymore.
fc	Oh,
fc	Okay.
fc	well, bye.
qy	Okay?
qw	What kind of books do you like to read?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	so do I.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I like biographies of people's lives, like, especially like athletes,
sd	for some reason it seems to interest me, like people that make a big comeback or, you know, Orel Hershiser, things like that.
sd	but they usually have some good articles in it.
sd	I'm more true, you know, nonfiction.
sd	but, not to say I wouldn't,
qw	What was the last book you read?
qy	Really?
b	Yeah.
bh	Really?
aa	I know.
sd	and so I'm not doing very well
b	Yeah.
sd	I let newspapers stack up and magazines stack up, if I don't really set aside a time to look or read them.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I would too.
qy	Have you ever read, or heard of the book THIS PRESENT DARKNESS?
sd	just hurry up and go through without putting down, you know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I'm sure it's fast or something.
sd	I just sleep better or something.
b	But,
b	Uh huh.
qw	Well, how about who,
qy	Do you know who it was about?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
bf	And then do it.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's all right.
qy^g	You're not ridged right? / * spelling: rigid
ba	That's good.
sd	There may be some schools you could read about and learn.
sd	about twenty.
aa	No.
aa	No.
sd	I do.
sd	I've been there about three years.
sd	and, most of my family's in Indiana.
sd	So, I've only been in Texas three years.
sd	I love the weather down here.
aa	I know.
sd	Boy they have storms here
b	Yeah.
qy	Were you here during the hailstorm two years ago?
sd	a lot of people had their cars totaled just from hail.
sv	I think State Farm went bankrupt. Just about .
bh	Really?
sd	and Colorado Springs.
sd	and he was telling me about it.
sd	They just sold it.
sd	Closed up and moved down to McKinney.
b	Yeah.
aa	I know .
br	How do I feel what?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	That's good.
b	yeah.
b	yeah.
sd	it's really surprising how many people graduate from high school, that I work with
sv	and, it's really, It's pretty sad.
sd	A lot of people that work for me that can't even spell or read, you know.
b	Yeah.
fa	I'm sorry,
sd	hobbies.
cc^t	I'll do it again.
qy^g	I hear you have kids, right?
qy^g	That's your full time, hobby, right?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I try to do some painting, although I'm not very good at it .
bd	not really.
sd	I have, you know, I inherited the genes that make me think I'm creative, but not the ones that give me the ability to be.
sd	I'm making drapes for my house, just because I'm,
sv	it's just being able to lay out the material and measure it because you need so much room.
sd	I've been doing that
sd	So that, at least I can do, you know, watching T V or whatever
sd	and I've gone and, you know, put the needle through my thumb a few times , trying to get it through
sd	so that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything, but I need to do it.
sd	Keeping fish, I guess is my biggest hobby.
sd	It depends on how frequently they die, and how much that bothers you.
sd	and they always died immediately,
sv	and, what I think now is the reason is I kept the tank too clean
sv	and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance.
sd	And I would just take everything out and just like, you know, wash it with scalding hot water
sd	and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again
sd	So now I only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing
sd	and I don't try and sterilize things .
aa	That's right.
sd	But that never worked well.
sd	It's a lot easier.
sd^e	not yet.
sd	I really do.
sd^e	I just have, you know, what they call community fish guppies, and platies and basic things.
sd	I don't get into the
sd	The expensive ones.
sv	and, you know, when they die it's more like an investment.
sv	You lost an investment
sd	Only if there's baby fish.
sd	You always have to isolate those.
sd	You get a
sd^e	they have breeders.
sd	It's a little plastic things that sort of floats
sd	and then it's got like a trough underneath her
sd	and there's a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber so the mother can't get to them either.
sd	but it's also got slots in it so the water can circulate
sd	it'll fit out the slots.
sd	But, you know, it works, I guess.
sd	they'll eat them.
ny	Yeah.
ny	Yes.
sd	and it's funny because the one I have, every single month without fail she has babies.
sd	and I've seen her do it.
sd	well, it makes you understand that, you know, things are different .
sv	but you know, that's the way it is for them.
aa	That's it.
sd	because if the baby is strong enough, it can swim away fast enough and go hide.
b^r	yeah.
ad	tell me what you think about the Vietnam war.
sd	France was there first.
b	Sure.
qw	Jerry, what did you think of people like, Jane Fonda, another anti war activist.
qy	Right or wrong?
sd	I thought we came in as first advisors to the French, and then they decided to pull out
aa	Sure.
t1	Well that's not,
bd	That's okay.
qy^d	had thought that they had, colonies there, or something.
bk	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Seventy four is when they quit sending troops.
qy	did you get to watch it?
qy	Are you a Cowboy fan?
aa	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	so everybody's really going crazy, you know, down here.
sd	but, you know, now it's like, you know, they're doing good so everybody's forgotten about that.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
aa	exactly. You know.
sd	so everybody is really excited.
sv	so everything's, looking real good.
b	Right.
sd	so he transferred to U C L A.
b	Right.
sd	They're playing tonight in fact.
sd	But they're doing some stomping on Virginia.
sd	Well, they're doing good tonight.
ny	Yeah
sd	they're winning. They're winning forty one to seven.
b	Right.
sd	I forgot about that.
sd^e	U C L A.
qo	What do you think? .
ad	but go ahead .
b	Right.
sd	We fax everything.
sd	We don't even wait for the mail anymore.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	but the more conveniences we have, the more that's expected of us
sv	Like we don't stop and wait for things to happen because we don't have to.
sv	So we have no relaxation time in between
sd	so they say that's really a bad thing. That you need to learn a lot of ways to deal with that and get your time in between things.
sd	You know, I'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years.
sd	I never really thought about it that way.
aa	That's true.
sv	We don't know that yet .
aa	That's true.
aa^m	right.
sv	and I guess every ten years it's just been very different.
sd	I know what I'm seeing here at my job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they're establishing careers
qy	do you vote regular? .
b^m	Every one.
sd	I've never paid any attention to voting.
nn	Huh uh.
^2	Unless you have something to do with it.
aa	Right.
qw	what do you mean by liberal,
sd	Well see, I don't know anything about politics.
qw	what's the main difference between Republicans and Democrats?
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	and you vote for the Democrats
qy^d	Usually.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bk	okay.
sd^e	I never have.
nn	Huh uh.
sd	I'm twenty six.
sd	well, I don't know that much about it.
sd	and I don't feel like I have enough knowledge on it to even, you know, to pick the right person.
sv	So that's what they need, well, they said something to improve voting.
qy	Do you know what I mean?
qy	wasn't it a woman.
sd	There was a woman that was running for vice president for a while.
sd	Ferraro.
bk	Okay .
sd	like I didn't know what the difference between Dukakis and Bush was.
sd	You know, I didn't know anything about Bush or Dukakis.
sd	I don't remember anything about Dukakis,
sd	but, well they're all saying that they're going to do, you know, whatever is best for their campaign anyway.
sv	if they had some kind of public programs where you can just go out and,
sd	like you know, in school they didn't teach you about the government, not really.
nn	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I know how they do it.
sd	like with the abortion issues and stuff.
b	Right.
sv	also the politicians put out what makes them look good anyway.
sv	And everybody's got, you know, stuff they don't want known.
sd	I didn't have much knowledge.
sd	I don't even remember this being on there.
^2	Incentive?
sd	now I'm sure they've got it at the library, you know.
sd	I've got two babies, so, I don't,
h	But I don't know.
sd	I know if enough people think like that it, you know, would make a difference, if people stopped thinking like that.
sd	well a lot of people, they'll vote the way their family votes, you know,
qy@	since you're what, Democrat? * slash error Then like your kids or whatever will follow you and just vote Democrat,
aa	right.
aa	No.
bf	All split.
b	Right.
sd	if I did understand politics I probably would vote more,
sd	or like when, Gary Hart was running, a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking,
sd	but, he was young.
sv	And then, I didn't think that was right, because he may have been a good president, or whatever.
sd	he had an affair,
sd	and it just threw him out of the whole running.
sd	And a lot of people go by their, personal life when they vote
sv	Which I guess if you got turmoil in your personal life, you're going to let it come into work
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, criminal or something like that's different,
sv	but, if him and his wife weren't getting along,
qy	Do you know what I mean?
sv	see we really don't see the, the true person anyway.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh .
qw	Well what did you think of Reagan as a president?
qy	Do you think he won from Carter because of the hostages that were held at that time?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I thought Carter was good too,
qy^g	that's been about ten years ago, right?
sd	and I liked him.
sd^e	I sure don't.
qy	Well, guess it's logical to ask, do you exercise any?
sd	and I don't really get out a lot because my job, to, to exercise.
b	Right.
aa	It is.
sd	I can tell that I've not really done a whole lot.
sd	stuff like that.
bh	really?
qy	the SWEATING TO THE OLDIES?
bh	really?
b	Right.
b	Right.
bh	really?
sd	Too tired to exercise. * slash error I did.
sd	so I gave it up.
^2	Walk around.
sd	and people will walk around the mall.
aap	it is fairly safe.
sv	certain parts of it.
sd	but I love to swim and water ski and stuff like that.
b	Right.
bf	you can't do it year round.
sd	that's the way ours is.
sv	it's too cold.
sv	Those are nice.
sd	I'm from Laurel.
sd	but we're about two hours from the coast.
sd	It started raining and got real cold.
b	Oh.
b	Right.
qy	so you enjoy camping?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	well . Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you have electricity out there.
sv	You've got a phone obviously .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
am	I guess so,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	well I grew up in California, in southe , in central California right in the valley.
sd	First, we went up with a Toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and you know cooked our, hot dogs by the fire or whatever.
sv	so, we have kind of moved up.
sv	A little bit in the world.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No .
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's, That will be pretty.
sd	We're set.
qw	What changes do you feel have happened?
qy^g	Increases each year, doesn't it?
sv	It increases each year I think.
sv	Well, and I think women have kind of had, in the past the real subservient role.
sv	Well, we do to some degree
sv	but, I think it's not as much as it was.
sv	I, And especially, I think with women increasingly working, they're going to have to demand more from men.
sv	Because there is just, impossible to keep up on everything else.
sv	Have more of an active role in taking care of children, more of an active role in taking care of the home.
b	Right.
sv	Well, you know, there is a lot of companies that won't give women maternity leave for that very reason.
sd	 you simply have to accumulate your sick leave. And take your sick leave.
sd	because they thought was showing prejisim to women and not to men
aa	, it is.
sv	and that's usually how it's, happened,
qw	What do you see, changing in the future?
aa	Right,
sv	Maybe top level.
ba	That would be kind of nice .
aa^r	that's right.
sv	A little more integration.
sv	And, maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners
b	Right.
b	Right.
sv	I don't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal .
sv	We just function differently .
sd	And, I'm not capable of lifting what, a man can lift and you know, that type of thing,
sv	I'm sure, in Dallas since you're big places, a lot more women are, working right out of their home with their P C's or with their lap computers or whatever.
na	Right.
sd	You only have to check in with the office once or twice a week
sd	Course, they're talking about, that we're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and banking and everything like that,
sv	and some ways, it might be kind of scary.
sv	Think anybody could do it,
qh	Would you have to give them the brand
fp	Hi.
qy	You didn't try rewallpapering?
qy	Did you use a textured paint
qy	Well, did you get good results?
b	Yeah.
qy	But it didn't, it didn't cover it?
sd	and I forgotten what it was you put down, and then you can just paint right over the dark.
sd	it was, just a real dark, wood grain type paneling
sd	but because of the dark behind it, it was really hard to cover
sd	the job was considerably tougher than we thought.
sd	and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something.
qy	have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	that's quite reasonable.
qy	have you tried matching paint lately?
sd	But my wife went to the, Home Depot, I think it was, and took a copy, took a piece of brick
sd	and they've got this machine that matches the color of paint.
sd	and it does it, electronically something, magic.
sd	but it's electronic.
sd	and then they wanted some gray to do the trim.
sd	but didn't occur to them that they could have taken a sample from,
sv	and, of course, if it's all white you're all right
qy	have you had problems getting colors to match?
qw	what's the solution then?
qy^g	Well, at least you'll get very good at it, right?
sv	You could go back and paint, the whole thing over
sd	I'll just do a little bit here and a little there .
sd	they don't do that in the newer houses now
sd	In a new house everything is white.
sd	We wound up selling the house.
sd	in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room, it has molding, like picture frames, I don't know what you call that that actually, that are along the walls, you know, up a couple of feet.
sd	And my wife painted the insides of those dark blue.
sd	And, it makes the room look remarkably smaller.
sd	The trim, is still white.
sd	and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive,
sd	but it makes the room look smaller which is, which is,
sv	but I, you wouldn't think that I,
sv	well, maybe, maybe that understands colors would know all of that stuff
sd^e	because the house has so many windows
sd	we have a soccer field that's, about a hundred yards from our house
sd	we didn't know that when we bought the house
sd	so. Anyway, it didn't, it didn't change
sd	it kind of bled under the masking tape which, I guess, is probably the topic we're we're really on to that the masking is,
sd	you have to do that very, very carefully.
fo	Well, I'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend.
sv	It's kind of frustrating.
fc	It's been good talking to you.
fc	Good bye.
qw	what do you think are some current trends in, the way families spend time together, based on what you've seen.
b	Yeah .
qr	or,
sd	I can, I know what you mean.
b	Yeah.
qy	Is he a hunter and a fisher and all that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and, they could spend more time with their kids
sd	and, you know, they're all like, kind of regretful, I think.
b	Uh huh.
sd	same here.
b	Yeah.
qy	At T I, is that where you work?
sd	and then they wouldn't see them at night, because they would be you know, at work and the kids are all ready in bed.
sd	This relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends, or something, you know.
sv	A lot of people choose to, which is fine.
sv	But, you know, then the kids kind of suffer.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	do you think it's more like watching T V and stuff like that, not really, ...
b	Yeah .
sv	it's always that way until it's too late.
sd	we didn't really have one .
sd	I guess I didn't realize what a luxury it was at the time.
sv	that's a good way to put it.
qo	well if you had kids, what kind of things do you hope to do? .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Do volunteer work and, be in clubs and stuff,
sd	I hope that happens, in my case.
b	Yeah. .
sv	and what's sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids. That may not necessarily be consistent with yours.
b	Yeah .
sd	I don't even remember them being around when we were little.
b	Yeah.
sv	we seem to agree.
aa	Yeah,
fc	I wish you the best.
fc	thanks.
qo	What vacations have you been on that you like?
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
bf	most of yours is kind of driving
qw	how far do you usually end up driving
qw	Now you're from where? * slash error Wisconsin.
sd	I have a brother in Minnesota that used to live in Wisconsin.
bf	that's quite a ways.
sd	we went to California this last year and, liked it,
sv	Walt Disney World, and other places, it's just the wrong time of the year to go.
sv	And, course, you get in any of those tourist traps and everything's, outrageously priced,
sv	you wonder if it's really worth it to pay, thirty five dollars or forty dollars just to get in.
sd	But, There's lots of fun places to see.
qy	that's something do to, like to get up in mountains / * two utts
qy	Do you have any mountains nearby?
qy^g	Pretty flat, isn't it?
sv	I think, the biggest limitation is a lot, just time and money, isn't it.
qw	What vacation have you enjoyed the most?
qw	What is it?
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	Probably a city in itself, kind of like, huh?
qw	How far away is it?
ba	sure.
ba	Sure.
sd	our climate's real dry
sv	You don't have as much of the greenery like you have.
ny	Yes.
qy	You ever heard of Boise?
sv	It's kind of fun to have a little bit diversity, and things like that.
sv	and, boy, they're gorgeous
sd	and that's real pretty over there too.
sd	But I think I'm kind of a summer vacationer.
b	Right.
qw	well what movies do you like?
sd	and he loves them.
qw	How old are you all?
bk	okay.
sd	Well I've got two.
sd	I had his birthday party yesterday.
qy	Is it as good as they say it is?
ba	Good.
sd	GHOST.
sv	but, it was good movie,
sd@	though, I can see why it won so many Oscars . / * slash error "though" should go with prev. utt
sd	And I like Demi Moore.
sd	and we don't have cable.
sd	it's just, you know, glued to the T V all the time anyway.
sd	I'm from Kentucky originally,
sd	and we used to get five channels without cable.
qy	do you watch soap operas?
qy	you work then?
sd	well we get the channel with YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS on it.
sd	and that comes on different channel.
sd	But we've got a V C R and a lot of tapes.
sd	And, my husband is a movie fanatic.
qy	have you seen that.
sv	That's good.
qy	have you seen it?
sd	The part where they're shooting mercy .
sv	and their, the language on that's filthy.
aa	I know.
fa	Sorry.
sv	now, you're glad you ain't got a four year old.
sd	I like the, SIXTEEN CANDLES, or sixteenth birthday or,
sd	and I loved it.
sd	well if you like love stories, it's sweet.
sd	I mean it makes you feel really sorry for her.
sd	I don't know, he looks like a little boy next door,
sd	He kind of looks like DOOGIE HOWSER.
sd	he just a little freckly, little boy.
sd	if I could remember the name, I know you'd know his name, because he's played in a few movies.
sd	but I can't remember it.
sv	Julia Roberts is good.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Wasn't it a murder mystery?
sd	yeah, that's the one I wanted to see where she was on a carnival, at a carnival on a Ferris wheel or something.
qr	or did it come out in the,
b	Oh.
sd	but it's just been down here a couple weeks, I think.
b	Yeah.
sd	he shaved the beard off.
b	Yeah.
qy	have you seen that?
qy	You didn't?
sd	well the only reason I know why it ended is on ARSENIO HALL one night, Christopher Reeves told, that, you know,
qr	Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas.
b	Yeah.
qy	Christopher Reeve wasn't in it at all?
sd	We've both been wanting to see it.
sd	well we was, teasing, about, you know, splitting our house down the middle .
qy	and they marked off routes that they could go or something .
sd	so we could do it.
sd	so we can, you know
fa	sorry.
sd^e	that's coming back, on too .
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'd like to see that and, THE NEVER ENDING STORY, came out on Disney this month, I think.
sd	I wanted to see that.
br	THE NEVER ENDING STORY?
sd	I enjoyed it.
aa	I do too
sd	all's I can really remember is him flying this great big dog, this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing,
qy	Did you see that movie with Fred Savage in it, though,
sd	it was THE PRINCESS BRIDE.
sd	I like, I like slapstick comedy.
sd	and she said that was hilarious.
sd	Two and a half . / * is this a title??
sd	and said it was real good
sd	Now, I seen that,
sd	she pretended to be the boss or something.
qy	Did you see HOME ALONE? .
qo^t	well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes? .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	You're a student?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	this is my exercise time
sd	and I have to admit I have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising's sake,
sv	and perhaps, it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun, or something like that.
aa^r	yes.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Is that why you like aerobics classes, because someone else is doing the counting for you, so, it makes it less of a chore?
b	Yeah.
sv	would that we could .
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, you're talking to someone from California where it's often swimming weather .
b	Uh huh.
sv	but, the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere.
sv	So, there must be something to some of them.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	And, the, the University of California at Berkeley puts out THE WELLNESS LETTER. Which turned into a fairly well subscribed to, newsletter, monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that
sd	there's been some progressive medical schools out here, that have taken that approach.
^h	Boy,
sv	you know, each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more, and a little bit more.
aa	Yeah.
sv	and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things,
sv	and, before long, you get this whole kind of Gestalt, this whole package of health, of health care and options
sv	The average person out on the farm, at least traditionally, now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything but } at least traditionally, the laborers,
br	Pardon me.
bf	like everything else.
bf	The rat race to exercise .
sv	well I, I think so.
sd	and they combine it with a, you know, meditation or whatever. Some sort of relaxation
sv	But you know, they live to a hundred and ten some , you know,
aa	That's true.
sd	I mean, they eat a lot of carbohydrates, and not much fat. for economical reasons, not for preference.
o	am I actually.
sd	as am I.
ny	Yes .
ny	yes.
sd	for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now.
sd	Well most, sort of modern looking restaurants will,
sd	and, and, it occurred to me,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b^r	uh huh.
sd^t	I think, that's the way everybody has done it so far.
sv	but I don't think, anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks, because they've been messing it up for many years, now.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
sd	I think it's seven here.
sd	Seven point something.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah .
qw	What state?
bh	really.
sd	we're still one of few that don't have the, state tax .
aa	That's true.
sd	I've lived in the Dallas area here since I was like four.
sd	I don't know.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I've just lived here,
^q*	Render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's. / * listen
sd	So, you know, even in the story where they had to pay the taxes, the disciples, and, Jesus said the money in the fishes mouth or in the fisher, inside the fish.
sd	And, I thought of those two things when I was holding for a long time.
ny	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
ba	sure.
ba	Sure.
b	Right.
b	Yeah
sd	so I've had to really switch around from the E Z form to the,
aa	Right .
sd	All the deductions and all that.
sd	I saw, that, too.
sd	We're looking at buying a house,
sd	And that was one of the main pluses that we have about buying a house.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	I know I get paid twice a month, every two weeks,
sd	that's once a month.
sd	Well, I get twenty six paychecks, which would come out to be in thirteen months.
sv	So if you pay your rent or your house payment every two weeks, Instead of once a month, you'll come out paying one month extra every year.
sv	And if have you a thirty year note, it will take like seven or plus years off of your note.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	it doesn't pay any interest,
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
sd	That's what we're looking at, fifteen or maybe twenty.
sd	We're not going to go longer than twenty.
sd	We're going to try to make our decision by July.
sd	Well, we just started two or three weeks ago.
sd	just two or three houses a week at the most.
aa	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Credit union has nine percent interest.
sd	we couldn't think of a better time to buy than now.
fc	But, anyway. Well, I can't think of a whole lot more to say.
fc	Me, too.
fc	My wife, she went to, the school out there in Lubbock.
b	Okay.
na	She went to school there.
sd	Cathy Walker.
b	Yeah.
qy	y'all work at T I?
bh^m	You do.
bh	really.
sd	I work in the waiver .
bh	really.
b	Yeah.
ba	wow.
sd	I'm, turning in a capital request right now,
sv	That's funny that's where you're from.
sd	A machine that puts back grind tape on and off the waivers .
sd^e	I'm sort of an acting process engineer.
sd	but that's pretty much what I do.
ny	Yeah.
na	Right
sv	but we needed that.
b	Yeah
sd	that's what he said here.
sd	He's gotten us into a linear flow that we've never been in before.
sv	That's been a real big plus.
sd	He's broadened, the devices that we're making, too, which has made us as lot more stable.
fc	Anyway, well, it was nice to talk to you.
fc	I can tell.
fc	me, too.
fc	Bye.
qo	So what, So what gets you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and it's one solicitation call after another
qh	and, why do we let this happen.
qw	I mean if you could legislate something, what would you legislate?
sv	And the people making these calls would be obliged to compare their lists that they're going to call against this list of people who don't want to be called.
sv	and those who don't want it, don't have to have it.
sv	Sort of like an unlisted number where you haven't gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself.
sd	Except even unlisted numbers aren't safe now because they have these things just sort of dial through all the numbers. automatically
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah .
b	Yes.
sv	and these people may in fact be just looking to find an unoccupied house to rob.
b	Uh huh.
sd@	What about these telephone callers. Sometimes they're door to door but usually they're telephone callers who want you to basically help them fill out a questionnaire. / * two utts
sd	basically it's a market survey
sv	but they never say who they're really working for or , you know, what what, what questions are, you know,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
b	Yeah .
sd	well, and sometimes this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too.
sv	Other times it's, you know, wasting your time to collect the data they want for their marketing purpose.
sd	For which, if they would just pay me enough money I would be willing to consider.
sv	but a dollar isn't it,
sv	and then you know, you go down a path
sv	and you don't know where it's going to end.
sv	and, And that seems to be something that should really be outlawed. Because it's subject to abuse
sd	And the only thing that I basically spend my money on is just food
sd	So, what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts.
sd	But the thing, also is that, you know, like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something, then I have to moderate that because it's like I can't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars, you know, three times a week.
sd	but it's not what I want to spend it on, you know.
nn	No.
sd	Because, they don't allow me to work since, I'm a foreign student.
sd	And so the government doesn't allow me to work.
aa	Uh huh.
qy^g	Well, the thing is that, I basically know how much I have, right?
sd	I get all my money out of the teller.
sd	And besides see one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since I have to call, you know, international.
sd	Argentina.
aa	Yeah.
sd	one of the problems is that I spend too much money on phone bills.
sd	they want me to call down there every so often.
^q	so I doesn't matter about the money because we need to hear from you.
sd^e	Because it is more expensive that way.
sd	basically the United States is the cheapest country to call out of.
sd	And, because it's considered a luxury in other countries.
sd	Since it's his money anyway, you know.
sd^e	I got money to pay that, too.
sd	so I won't have to, you know, rush a letter to him or something,
sd	because, he really wants me to concentrate on my studies.
sd	I'm doing masters in computer science and computer engineering.
bf	With those degrees?
sd	Well, I can work here up to a year.
sd	And hopefully get a job after that.
sd	computer communications and data transmissions.
qy^g	and so, well, you have a family, right?
qy	And does your wife work?
bk	okay.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	and you have a monthly budget?
b	Right.
qy^d	So, you don't have any problem in, overcharging on your credit card, and stuff like that.
b^r	yeah.
sd	and you know, I don't wa , I don't like to give any at all
sd	because the thing is that, you know, it's like if I want something I'll ask somebody, you know,
sd(^q)	And I said, I want a backpack.
sd(^q)	I told him if you want to give me a present for Christmas give me a backpack.
sd	and I knew he needed an alarm clock.
sd	So, I bought him an alarm clock.
aa	Right,
sv	it's like,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sd	and I spent around like, maybe, two hundred dollars.
^q	Let's see how much money we have afterwards.
sv	And if I felt like I spent way to much then, I won't go out, you know,
sd	I went skiing over the Carolina Mountains which aren't anything,
sv	but you know, it was, I guess it was worth it,
sv	especially if you live on campus, and you don't have a car, you just go crazy.
fc	Yeah.
fc	Well, nice talking to you.
fc	Bye bye.
qw	what baseball team are you familiar with?
qy	no Texas Rangers?
sv	I don't care if you're President.
qy^g	men know how to do that, right?
sv	that must have been hard on him because he's just a person
sd	because that's all you hear about is, if, you know, about Neal Bush I think is his name.
sd	and I never had to watch the news you know, not like some people hour and a half a day or anything.
sd	I saw that.
^q	I want to see your driver's lic ,
sd	but I didn't see it
sd	I don't know, that much about it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Did they?
b	Uh huh.
sv	That's so stupid that you all have two teams.
sv	That's really stupid.
aa	I know.
b	Yeah.
sd	The Texas Rangers, they lost, I think.
sd	We got free tickets because one of the deacons at church, parks cars at The Mansion at Turtle Creek which is like one of the places and stuff.
sd	is this funny, as they're parking the cars the valet service.
sd	but anyway, someone gave an Iranian a tip of four Rangers tickets last year,
sd	so he decided that some wealthy man tipped this Iranian, with baseball tickets,
sd	And so we were, walking up
sd	and so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor,
sd	and nobody brings two children in these seats, you know because,
sd	if they did hit a ball I would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in, you know.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
sd	I'm glad my husband's not like that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's funny.
^2	You miss the whole thing.
sd	I had a friend in college from Strasbourg,
sd	and she's lived there like, off and on for twenty years.
qy	Saint Claude is that sound familiar?
aa	Yeah.
bh	really?
b	Uh huh.
sd	and they have twelve children.
na^m	She has twelve children.
sd	and, I mean, four or more children are thin,
o	I mean, I'm not kidding you.
sd	and they're all eight and under, and nine and under,
sd	And so I'm real proud of them because they don't do that at all.
sd	And I always give her a hard time who's toothbrush did you really use this morning .
sd	I mean, it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done,
^q	But you've got five kids, you know,
sd	there's a good book called WHAT THE BIBLE HAS TO SAY ABOUT CHILD TRAINING, by Richard Fugate
sd	so they're not going to be a curse to you when they're thirteen.
sv	But a lot women die or shop at Foley's
sd	It's like a Macy's, kind of store,
qy	You know what I mean?
qy^g	but, it's kind of a different situation because you're probably living in an apartment, right?
b	Yeah.
sd	I don't even think they have but two old enough to play yet.
sd	and, that's what they're called to do.
b	uh huh.
aa	no.
sd	They're eight and eleven
sd	and they're into sports
sd	I mean, as a matter of fact, that's what we're doing tonight .
sd	Baseball has started.
sd^e	we start here at, five.
sd	it's coach pitch, until you get nine which my little boy will be nine in May.
sd	So he's going to be with, regular pitching
sd	and my eleven year old, of course, you know, is pitching.
sd	So there's always something.
sd	If we're not doing sports we go somewhere.
ny^r	yeah.
sd^e	usually in the summer time.
sd	Different places every year.
nn	No .
b	Uh huh.
sd	when they go, it's on business
sd	it's not really just to getting to sight see.
ba	I bet it is, too.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close.
ny^r	yes.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
sd	my husband also, we're involved in everything our kids does
sd	because, my dad died, you know, when I was less than a year old
sd	So I always thought, when I have kids, you know, I really want to be involved with them.
b	yes,
b	Uh huh.
b^m	Best friends, now.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
sd	we have to take them, and, you know to do it.
sd(^q)	because you're saying, Well, I work full time too, you know.
aa^r	yeah.
b	uh huh
b	Yeah.
sd	and we knew time wise, and money wise, too
sv	it would not have been a good idea to had them then.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sv	but you can't take this money with us, though
sd	that's how I keep looking at it.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah.
qw	What are you learning to be?
qw	I mean, what are you wanting to do after you get out of college?
sd	my husband's into, computers.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	And you don't want to?
b^m	no.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
b^m	Then you'll never leave.
sv	Well maybe something will open up for you.
fc	well I've enjoyed talking to you.
fc	bye bye.
qy^t	They tell you what our topic was?
qw	How much of a golfer are you?
sd	I think I played better golf when I was fifteen, John, than I play right now.
sd	I come from a family of golfers.
sd	I mean, I was raised by a man, my stepfather who, with a two handicap, I mean, he, he, he could get down on his knees and hit the ball, I mean, further than most people could hit it.
sd	they'd leave work and go to a golf course, or a little country club they belonged to back in Richmond, Virginia and just, play nine holes of golf.
sd	That was their deal,
sd	sort of like the non golfer golfer of the family.
bh	really?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	it's a hunter's type affair
sd	I live in the Dallas area, but I go down to Austin and go with my good customer and friend of mine
sd	and we always buy this weekend at a country club in the hill country. You know, at, Horseshoe Bay.
sd	and, course, believe it or not by the end of the third day and the end of the, third course, my score has gone from, you know, a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five.
sd	so that makes a lot of difference to me.
aa	You bet.
sd	when I do swing it's an easier swing
sd	and I do, actually, hit the ball better.
sd	off the tee.
sd	that's why I need my driving lessons.
ba	That helps.
sd	so I get a pretty good little drive
sv	if you'll take lessons, the first thing they put in your hand is an iron.
sv	but I think the key is you need to play more often than I play.
b	Right.
ba	makes good sense.
b	yeah.
sd	if I get off the tee box and I've, you know, you know, anything from a hundred fifty to two hundred yard drive through a straight, I just want to get down and kiss the ground, you know .
qo	So, how you like New Jersey?
qy	I don't know what part of New Jersey you're in, but I guess it's, fairly industrial?
b	Right, uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that.
b	Yeah.
sv	so you get a lot of people out there without E T R, emission control systems on their cars and things like that.
b	Yeah,
b	Sure.
sd	They're actually coming out with the first prototypes in California.
b	Yeah.
sv	and I know it's not due to, to gasoline or to, you know, carbon monoxide so much as the C F C s
sv	I think that's a contributor definitely.
ad	go ahead.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And that's one of the arguments that the Third World countries have been using is, that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes if that makes any sense.
sd	and it's increasing even as near the Equator as like Florida and Cuba and those places.
sv	It's , not a real good one actually.
qy	have you been in big cities a long time?
sv	those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard, I would think.
sd	Denver's that real good e , that real good, example of sitting in a valley, kind of like Mexico City does, I guess.
sd	Mexico City is historically been one of the worst in the world for that.
sd	I mean, it definitely it's not at a level comparable to Los Angeles or Denver
sd	And there's not that much in terms of public transportation down there.
sd	You say you're from Atlanta.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I live in Atlanta also.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city?
b	Uh huh.
aap	I probably agree with that.
b	Uh huh.
qy	so, well do you think Atlanta's as bad as most other cities?
b	Uh huh.
sv	I don't think it's as bad as L A either.
sv	I don't think we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I came to the conclusion also that, you know, if you are walking in a downtown area, you know, where there's a lot of crime, a lot of that's going to just keeping your senses about you and trying not to look like a victim, you know.
sv	You know, you know, walk with, you know, with just walk in a confidently,
sv	and, you know, don't be looking around like you've never been there before and you have no idea where you are.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	have you ever, have you ever been mugged in Atlanta?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've been pretty lucky about getting mugged.
sd	and that's been about the only, you know, you know, potentially violent crime that I've seen in Atlanta.
sd	And that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed.
bh	really.
qr	or,
ba	Really.
aa	yeah.
sd	and, you know, about half the time the A P D seems to recover them, you know in various states of disrepair . Up on blocks.
sd	and when he got it back his, dashboard was sitting in the front seat .
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, you're probably luckier than.
qr	or was that all there was, body.
b	Uh huh.
qw	So how do you know this much about, stealing cars?
qy	You have any pets?
ny	Yeah.
qw	what kind?
qr	Is it a miniature or a standard Schnauzer?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sv	They say ,
qw	what was the other dog you had?
b^m	a sheltie.
b	Yeah.
sv	They can be nippy.
sv	They're good temperament.
sv	They put up with a lot.
sv	Schnauzers, in particular probably.
b	yeah.
sv	it seems the smaller the are, the worse off they are .
sv	they're bred down so much.
sv	They aren't the best pets.
b	Yeah.
sv	I mean, some people seem fairly well suited for for, miniature poodles and such.
sv	they're actually very friendly dogs.
sd	and they are just really nice, really friendly, kind of like medium intelligence.
sd	Well, because some people, want to train them as,
aa	Yeah.
sd	You really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way.
sd	it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really respond.
aa	Right.
sd	They are very determined critters
sd	and they aren't that big. And, just really friendly.
sd	I was overwhelmed.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd	They picked up a lot of bad press lately.
b	Well, yeah.
sv	But, any, any pet's can, can be bad if you train it to be that way.
sd	in my hometown, they just outlawed ferrets because they had one incident of a ferret, attacking a child in a house.
sd	the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild
sd	now it's like ferrets are outlawed in the town.
sd^e	it bit him.
sv	but I think it was probably an individual ferret thing, because it was a fairly wild ferret.
b	Yeah,
sd	They didn't.
sv	It's too bad it happened, though.
sd	but, that's how I'm staying up.
qy	do you like how it's presented on the news?
bf	So, it makes you feel like they're, wanting you to take their opinion.
qy^g	and it's kind of distressing, isn't it?
sv	And I've noticed that they do it just with subtle little words, usually, just that sway the whole, report you know, by just a couple of words.
qy	Were you looking into becoming a reporter
b	Uh huh.
ba	I bet that's a interesting job.
sd	It's going to cost them seven point five billion after tax charge in ninety three, to account for that.
sd	And it'll drop their earnings by a hundred million a year forever more.
qy	do you read the WALL STREET JOURNAL?
qo	Can you think of anything that could be done to make our news media more accurate and objective?
sv	so they have the big story.
qy	are you into the Cowboys?
qy	yeah?
ba	Well, that that's all right.
b	Yeah.
sd	I guess I'm kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects.
sd	I kind of like them.
b	Yeah.
sd	To be honest with you, I probably watch, college a little bit more than I do pro.
sd	Quite a bit.
bh	Is it?
am	That could be.
b	Yeah.
sv	You probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then.
sd^e	I root for Nebraska quite a bit.
aa	Ye , .
sd	to be honest with you, I find that too much running gets pretty boring as well
b	Right.
sv	A lot of like the big eight teams that used to run so much. I think they're starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore.
qy^g	that's getting ready to start up, right?
qy	Have you followed that very much
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	It can take over a small market share
b	Right.
sd	But, when in reality, it's really Americans playing somewhere else you know .
sd	I've never really played it
sd	I've like to watch, rugby every now and then.
h	whatever you want to call it there.
sv	there's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere .
b	Yeah
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	You've played it then?
sv	Not, at least not in this country anyway.
aa	It is.
aa	Yeah.
sd^e	I don't.
sd	To tell you the truth, I'm not even really from here.
sd	I'm up here for a year on an internship.
sd	But I actually live in Florida.
aa	Yeah.
qy^g	Well, you know, {E I . I mean, } who who the heck is going to root for Tampa Bay, right ?
h	but I don't know.
ad	Go ahead .
sd^m	They can if they choose to.
qy	well have you had any experience with it at all?
qo	So what do you think about that?
sv@	and they may not tell you the reason why. * slash error Uh huh.
sv	Or this person never use any drugs.
sd	I don't know.
sv	and I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time.
sd	and I was taking Entex. And my doctor gave me a prescription for it.
sv	and if they would just say this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them you know. Then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything.
h	So I don't know.
sd	because they say they can spot check.
b	Yeah.
sv	You know, as a health professional, I wouldn't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs.
sv	So you know, I guess you have to have trust some place along the way.
sv	You can't go around testing everybody for everything.
sv	I can see where it could become a problem.
ba@	wow! But * two utts maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. / * sv
sv	and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever.
b	Yeah.
qw	Well, what kind of vacations do you like to take? .
b	Uh huh.
qw	Where have you gone there?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, I've been over there too.
sd	mostly Germany and France.
sd	I lived in France for a year and a half
sd	but, once when I had a chance in France to go on vacation instead of travelling around France I went to Germany
sd	and I just like it there.
sd	but, Austria, I found really pretty and Switzerland,
sd	so I anything in the mountains over there I just love.
sd	I lived in Africa, actually,
ny	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sd	and or unless you fly from Nairobi, you have to fly through, Europe on your way home.
sd	and I really liked it there too.
sv	That's the one thing.
sd	actually now you can get some really good deals flying over,
sd	once you're there you still have to spend money . Unless you know people, you know .
sv	That helps a lot.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	most of my vacationing in the U S has been on the West Coast
sd	or this summer I went to Colorado
sd	and, I'd love to go to the East Coast, during the Fall.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I haven't been anywhere on the East Coast.
sd	I think Tennessee has been the furthest east I've been.
b	Yeah.
am	I guess so.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qr	like, would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place, or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week?
sv	mainly probably because you want to see everything.
aa	I know.
b	Yeah.
sd	I was working in Cameroon, Africa
sd	I mean, they're not used to having tourists there,
sd	I liked it.
sd	The people there are just very friendly
sd	I was working with an organization that does Bible translation.
sd	So I was doing linguistic work actually, travelling around, finding out about languages, and what they call survey work.
sd	Find out where the languages are.
sd	So, I travelled a lot around the country and met a lot of people.
sd	I enjoyed it.
b	Yeah.
sd	and then she went over to Nairobi and took a safari around you know, close to Nairobi in Kenya.
sd	So, she'd always dreamed of doing that too.
sv	It sounds like we've been to some of the same places.
qy	I guess by what you said you don't feel you're, privacy has been invaded anytime recently?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	because, you know, if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say, look, you know, I want my name unlisted or want my, you know,
qy	It doesn't?
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	you know, they're a department store.
sd	and, they had this bill, that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise, over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise.
sd	and the date that she supposedly made this purchase, she was in Denver with me for Thanksgiving.
sd	and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number.
sd	they use Joe Blow's social security number, and can, potentially ruin someone's credit.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
qw	So, how is the weather out there?
bh	really?
sd	The usual, I think.
sd	It's good.
qw	What part?
bk	Okay.
qy	It's more humid in Utah than there?
qrr	Or there?
aa	Right.
bk	Okay.
sd	because when it's cold, it's really cold.
br	What's that?
sv	So the humidity is I think what does it .
sd	when it would snow in Texas I mean we'd be really cold
sd	and you don't you don't feel super cold.
sv	It was weird.
qrr	Or did you,
bh	really?
qy	So you just barely moved away?
qy	Do you like it out there?
b	Yeah.
qy	So you just moved away a year ago?
ba	Wow, really recent.
ba	warm .
sd	like, it's probably fifty, fifty five, maybe.
sd	it's not that cold, really.
b	Yeah.
sd	that's a big deal in Texas, too.
qy	So, did you used to ski when you were out here?
qy	Did you used to ski when you were in Utah?
bh	really?
sd^e	but I like to when I get a chance.
sd	Just saving my money for Christmas things and that.
sd^e	this is actually my third year.
ny	Uh huh.
ny	Yep.
sd^e	at B Y U.
ny	Yeah.
sd	So, but, I'll be here a long time , at this rate.
sd	but I'm in the process of changing it right now.
sd	Because it's really, really competitive at B Y U.
sd	You have to have like a three seven to get in
sd	so I think I better get into something that I can enjoy the process of going to school
qr	or,
qw	In,
qy	Really?
sd	That what my sister did.
sd	I think she graduated around then, too, though, eighty seven probably,
sd	Because they, since, stopped that program. I mean, where you can where you can get it double pretty easily.
qy	are you presently looking, for a used car?
b^m	Just bought one.
qw	what did you get?
bf	Lexus is a Toyota subbrand.
sd	because they're talking like it was an American built car.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	but the particular seems to be the quiet ride.
b	Yeah.
qy^g	that wasn't a standard, feature, was it?
bk	Okay.
b	Yeah,
qy	you mean the antilock brake system?
b	Yeah.
sv	this is probably suspension tied into the brakes.
fe	shoot
sd	snow doesn't happen very often.
sd	We got a pretty fair amount of snow.
sd	and it was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane, manly, adult men into playful little children.
sd	But, while they were there they set back , drank about four or five cups of coffee apiece and made snowmen on the hoods of their vehicles threw snowballs all over the place, had themselves a ball for about an hour .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	Oh,
bf	It's a package deal.
b	Yeah.
ba	Ouch.
sd	I worked for Lincoln,
sd	Little Mercury Tracer
sd	imagine, or not, they make a luxury Mercury Tracer.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^2	Like sitting in your living room.
qy	Adjustable?
b	Yeah .
qy	Have you tried much with it?
b	uh huh.
aa	Yes.
b	Yes.
sv	the secret seeming to me to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and, pounds to kilograms,
sv(^q)	and, I think that's what hung people up the most is they went now wait a minute, an inch is two point fifty four centimeters,
^q	how on earth am I every going to do the math? / * spelling
sd	but I'm perfectly comfortable using either.
sv	it's hard to take it seriously.
^q	the other one must be for someone else.
sd	and we inherited this mess from them
sv	and you sort of have to force people to change since they don't want to .
sd	and America does have a long history of sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting, you know, some other model.
sd	and then in parenthesis it said four hundred fifty four point six grams .
sd(^q)	every time I see something like that I think, well, that's an anti metric argument.
qy	You don't?
^q	at midnight, tonight we all switch over or anything.
sd	That's an example of something you can't do gradually.
sd	A quantum leap from left to right hand drive .
sd	that was something that had to be done quickly, you know, because of external circumstances,
sd	but they decided to do it to make themselves in sync with the rest of Europe, or the rest of continental Europe
sv	and, you know. But that must have been tremendously difficult to orchestrate.
sd	and after all, the whole reason to go over to metric is to have round numbers, so they don't deal with thirty seconds of an inch
sv	Really, I think.
sd	I don't drink soda pop,
sd	and if you start expressing one liters and one kilograms and then the pounds come in the, you know, the odd numbers, you know, two point two pounds or something. I think people will start getting a sense of, gee the metric is the sensible one.
fc	I enjoyed talking with you too.
qo	what kind of hobbies do you have Lori?
b	Uh huh.
qw	Where do you play golf in this area?
b	Uh huh.
qr	do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf?
b	Oh.
sd(^q)	I was going to say, that could be difficult .
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think that might be true.
sd	I don't like pulling a cart on Firewell golf course because they want you to pull the cart on the path.
sd	That is the reason, I don't play over there.
sd	I like the course, but I don't play over there because, they don't, you know don't allow you to pull a cart.
sv	And, I don't think a cart damages the turf.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I live, very close to the Firewheel Golf Course.
sd	Right up there near the golf course.
sd	Well, in the last two years, I have not played very much golf because I am involved in Boy Scouts.
sd	So, I have, I have children Boy Scout age.
sd	and, so I am very active in Boy Scouts
sd	so I would have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and Boy Scouts is my hobby.
sd	and it is probably going to be six to eight years before they go to college.
sv	Lessons are expensive though.
sd	I only took lessons for golf when I was in college.
sd	as a course for P E you know so I could graduate.
sd	and that was kind of a group scenario and not individual.
sd	Besides that, I just, try to make the club hit the ball.
sd	I don't want to play strike out, you know.
sd	you know, I have some good shots and some bad shots.
qy	Do you have, special flowers?
sd	My wife had, just put in a bunch of, I want to say, they are pansies.
sd	She put them in like two months ago cause they are winter plants.
sv	we thought even with all the cold weather weather we have had they have been blooming just fine.
sd	That is when she did, I think.
qy	Will they make it through the summer sun?
ba	Well, that is good.
sd^t	and hobbies in our spare time is what we've been selected to discuss today.
b	Oh .
bh	really?
sd	so I never have time to deal with them.
sd	I like photography a lot,
sd	so I'll take a lot of pictures of her, you know, and spoil them,
sv	if I could make it on the road, I'd like to play on like a bluegrass band or something,
sd	I've done it before when I was in high school and college, and thoroughly enjoyed it,
sv	but that's the way life is, I guess.
aa	Exactly.
sd	and, and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half
sd	and that went over real well,
sd	but, that's about it there.
aa	yeah.
ba	that's great.
ba	That's great.
sd	so we've been out twice in this year so far. By ourselves without the child
sv	so it's kind of, become an issue you could say.
sd	I like, messing around in your house building things, and, you know, putting cabinets up, and, those kind of things,
aa	It's really kind of fun.
sv	Especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty,
ba	Sounds like it.
qy	Do you like to cook?
sd	I love to cook, too,
bh	really?
sd	I like to cook and eat and, to have, mainly, I guess, I get to
sd(^q)*	amount of people eat, * listen and then say, man this is really good,
sd	work in the garden, work around the yard, of course,
sd	smoke them an ,
sd^e	all that hoedown stuff.
sd	All that stuff that's bad for you.
b	yeah.
b	yeah.
sv	That's, only way to do it.
sv	there's pluses to everything,
sd	I play a lot of racquetball.
sv	sounds like you,
br	Horses?
sv	you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete,
sv	and that's about it down here,
sv	Well, sounds like you have a lot of nice hobbies there.
sv	I know it's probably late for you,
fc	I enjoyed speaking with you
fc	have a good weekend.
fc	Bye bye.
qo	So, do you have any hobbies?
b	Yeah,
sd	I'm an avid gardener,
sd^t	they were like suggesting, like handcraft things which,
sv	but I, I think anything that you enjoy,
sv	I mean, it could be working on cars could be your hobby really.
sd(^q)	I says, you go pay to have someone do it.
^q	Because it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something.
sd^e	well, right now we, start our seeds inside.
sd	We'll start them inside
sd^e	well, we usually start them right in the house.
sd	you can leave them outside.
sd	You might put them in the ground just the first week of June
sd	but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of May.
b	Oh.
sd	well, we live really close to Lake Champlain, which is in the Champlain Valley,
sd	so we're about two weeks ahead of everyone else out on the outskirts
ny	Yeah.
sd	and, his crop gets killed.
sd^e	from Plattsburgh Air Force Base.
sd	it's, depressed economically.
sd	I mean, I'm a technician.
sv	When they start getting rid of technicians,
sd	Well, I interviewed with them.
sd	Even though my, mother's people are from Georgia.
b	Yeah.
ad^t	Well, I guess we have to get back to hobbies since,
sd	my sister grows flowers that you can dry,
sd	And we made some really nice Christmas wreaths with, dried red flowers and dried white flowers and, eucalyptus.
qy	you know what eucalyptus is?
aa	Yeah,
sv	but it is kind of a nice smell after a while.
sd	in the last five years I've used so much of it that,
sd^e	it is.
sv	it looks really potent stuff.
sd	but I, I'm so, timid when it comes to starting a business.
sv	it is, especially with being in on the creative aspect and the crafty end.
sd	and his, son built him a garage and got him some, I don't know what the equipment's called, but planers and things and set him up,
sd	He gets right into it
sd	it's a, it's a really, good thing because it's keeping him sane,
sd	plus it's keeping his marriage ,
sd	but he's getting to the point where he needed an extra boost, to do something like that.
sd	He d , He dowels everything.
sd	I don't see too much scrap around.
ba	God , I'm envious .
qy	Is it going to be, Is it going to be really dry?
sd	so the cold weather can kill them
sd	I guess they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall, all .
b	Yeah.
sd	and, when you have time to do it .
sd	She gets right into it.
sd	They landscape their whole house with flower gardens.
sd	She's got like, just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and mulch tree bark all over her lawn .
 %	It gets, ya ,
qrr	or is it,
qy	So you don't have a lot of tree coverage?
sd	See, my, well, my grandmother passed away, but where aunts are they have these huge pecan trees,
sd	and they just shade everything.
sd	it's in Georgia.
sv	but when I think of Texas, I think of nothing but, no trees and just grass .
b	Yeah.
qy	So it's that dry heat?
qy	wasn't it Houston's humid?
b	Yeah.
qo	How would you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home?
b	Uh huh.
qw	And what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him?
ba	my.
aa	Right.
sd	She has leukemia
sd	and the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in Dayton, and were several thousand miles away
sd	She had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and T V set
sd	so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room
sd	But when it got to the point I was spending more time at the hospital with her,
sd	and I've got little children here who needed me here
sd	she needed somebody to watch her twenty four hours a day.
sd	even though I would have liked to have had her stay, with her health being what it was she couldn't anymore.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sd	but she's accepted it real well now
sd	but when she does a nurse is right there to help her
sd	so. It became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair
ad	so we've got to talk about music.
qr	And, do you like classic rock, or modern rock, or which kind?
qy	not a seventies baby.
qrr	or is it like,
bf	so they can get like the Doors and Led Zepplin.
aa	that's cool.
qy	And, how about the Rolling Stones?
qy	How about, Pink Floyd?
sv	so then we got some same things
sd	I listen to heavy metal or classic rock.
sd	We're talking about what they call hard rock.
sd	Like, for example, let's see, Bad Company,
sd	well, they're like, for example, A C D C.
qy	have you heard of them?
sv	that's, that's not really hard rock.
bk	Okay.
sd	Well, Cinderella is hard rock, heavy metal.
sd	and the guitar is set like, really low,
sd	and then they start dancing around,
sd	and they just bump into each other,
sd	like they hit each other with their shoulders,
sd	and what you do is, you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people.
sd^e	I don't like that music.
sd	that's what some people call like really heavy metal.
sd	and, like, you always thought about, like, suicide. And killing people and stuff like that.
sd	they just talk about, like, life in general.
qy^d	Like, Queen's Reich, if you ever heard of them.
b	Yeah.
sv	but, but, but you got to like Queen also.
qw^d	let's see, the one that they have the whole opera singing in the background.
sd	Bo, Bohemian Rhapsody.
sd	Because, I mean, I just love that song.
sv	But then, they started going downhill like everybody else.
sd	I don't like the new stuff.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Well, for example, I used to like old Phil Collins.
sd@	An old, Genesis? / * listen
sd	and then he came out with, see, for example, his record like, No Jacket Required.
sd	I can't stand him.
sd	And so, that's what gets me mad.
qy	But, did you go see that new Doors movie?
sd^e	I saw it when it opened.
sd@	Well, it's, you know, it's like, I was watching Siskel and Ebert, * slash error you know, like those guys that criticize movies?
sd	And, they both loved the movie, right?
^q	it took me back to the sixties, and stuff like that.
sd	Because like, the end is, like, really depressing.
sd	I was born in nineteen hundred sixty nine.
sv	I mean it's just that, like the sixties music's got a lot to say.
sd	I never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too.
sv	but I bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants,
qy	did you go to college?
ba	that's cool.
b	Okay.
b^r	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in progression, ever in history.
sd	about everything.
sd	the eighties are called, like the progressive years, or, you know, like the technology years, because of all the computers and stuff.
sd	I mean, nobody cared to name it .
sv	Him just standing there.
^q	you're not missing anything, you know,
sv	I mean, it was, I guess it was pretty bad times.
sd^t	we've been talking for seven minutes,
bk	Okay.
fa	I'm sorry.
bk	okay.
fc	It is not, that bad.
fc	Bye, bye.
sd	maybe you saw in the paper this morning that, they've had some problems with, the recycling on plastic,
sv	I thought that was most interesting.
b	Yes.
aa	That's right.
sd	and she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics, and her aluminum,
sd	now we're doing it on a, city wide basis in communities.
sv	So it's wonderful that we've come that far, I think
sd	there were places where she could actually take her, things herself,
sd(^q)	and I thought wow, that is wonderful, that somebody does that.
b	Yeah.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah.
bh	Isn't that amazing?
sv	People, I don't know, they find fault in everything, rather than say this is a good effort.
aa	Yeah.
aa	I know what you're saying,
b	Yep.
b	Right.
aa	I agree.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	Sure.
sd	and she is to this day,
sd	or, if she needed, sandwich paper or something, she'd use that.
sd	I recycle like zip lock bags and, things like that.
sd	I mean, they I think they give me a hard time,
sd	but I think they know that that's, it's the right way .
aa	That's right.
sv	you, you can't be waited on all your life and expect things to always work out.
aa	that's right.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No.
b@	* slash error Uh huh.
aa	yeah,
sv	I think that it has to really hit home before, the message sometimes.
sv	Or you have to grow up with it being important in your life, before the message really takes hold sometimes.
sd	, it's just really interesting to me how now more aware of things I am even myself, than I used to be, a few years ago.
sd	I mean, like I'd go to the U T D, cafeteria for lunch sometimes
sd	and they use styrofoam plates, when they wouldn't, need to use styrofoam plates.
sd	I wonder if, you know, maybe I need to bring that to someone's attention, you know,
sd	and I think it's, just McDonald's effort to reduce the number of styrofoam, boxes that they use, for hamburgers and stuff,
sd	I think is a good example, you know, that even, industry is willing to do it.
sv	Well, I think that's kind of what it's coming to, I'm sure.
aa	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba@	* slash error I know it,
sd	Well, it depends where in Dallas you are.
sd	There are certainly parts of town I would not want to live in.
sd	it is very location dependent
sd	and there are parts of town here where, when they talk about the nightly gunfire.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yeah.
bf	the, what they call the latchkey children.
sv	so I think our,
sd	not that we don't have a certain amount of local problems
sd	and, the main crimes within the suburb here are the theft crimes. A small number of assaults,
sd	well, if we have one murder a year that's probably as many,
sd	but then, you know, you go into Dallas and they are, unfortunately having murders at a rate greater than one a day.
b	Uh huh.
sd	it's one of those things where, if you're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on
sd	Unfortunately there are often these correlations that are inverse of what they should be like, wherever there are more, criminals, there are more policemen
sd	but that's which came first.
sv	it's basically the problem is in the society and the society's views
sd	and, well, since now I'm in my mid forties, when I was in grad school or when I was an undergraduate growing up in a more rural area I thought, you know, crime was reasonably unknown and just the situation that's developed with the drug * new slash unit? aspect of, the pushers, the dealers and the addicts,
sd	Because it just was not, something back in the sixties that I even had to worry about.
sv	so it's effected all of us.
b	Uh huh.
sd	You know, in a sense I'm n , I have real mixed feelings on that
sd	it would certainly be an interesting test
sd	and I think if I look back fifty or a hundred years I'd say, you know, back then there were the opium dens
sd	they let this person who had ruined it well, die or whatever.
sd	I mean they probably became weakened physically and other things to the point that their life expectancy was real short,
sv	we need to take care of people even if they have, you know, physically ruined themselves.
b	Yeah
sd	I would certainly like to see a real test of making drugs real cheap to see if when you make them available people then don't use them.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, of course, I'm a baby of the old school
h	not that I'd remember that much from the fifties
sv	but basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality.
sd	Of course I work for lawyers a lot
sd	and I see, unfortunately, we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and, you know, there's a million dollars you can have for mental duress or whatever.
sd	is that people are well indoctrinated in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable.
sv	if you're going to drink, and you may drink, you better have your designated driver.
sv@	In this country, and for example with alcohol or with drugs we don't seem to understand how to handle it as a society to say it is okay under these circumstances, but if you step outside these bounds, the punishment is extreme. * slash error And we mean it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	But, that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking and driving was, misplaced for years
sd	you know, it was an acceptable social behavior.
qw	what does your city have for gun control if anything?
sd	and none of them are recent, right.
qy	do you know who he is?
sd	and Willie Nelson.
aa	Yeah.
sd	I just like Willie Nelson I guess because he's such a character.
b	Yeah.
aa	My truck is broken down.
sd	he plays piano.
sd	but he plays wonderfully.
sd	I like that.
sd	I've got a piano,
sv	It is real relaxing.
b	Yeah.
aa	so do I.
sd	Forgot about that.
sd	I forgot about jazz .
sd	I love them.
sd	and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it
sd	and it was just so wonderful.
sd	And then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it.
b	Yeah.
sd	you know those little booklets that come along with it
sd	and you can just see the things that they're trying to show with music.
sd	then he buys the pieces that have that person. You know, on it.
sd	but he does.
qy	Were you in the band?
sd	So was I.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy	Did you like them?
qy	Is it just instrumental?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	And, then } I'm going to go to Sulphur Springs.
qw	where are you?
sd	So we're in Garland.
ny	Yeah .
ny^r	yeah.
sd	not because there's much else .
qy	For colleges?
sd	No more for me.
qw	what do you do?
qy	Are you going to go to East Texas for that?
sd	and it was for a murder trial.
sd	Anyway, this is happened in nineteen eighty three.
sd	and the trial won't take place until June.
sd	and he's going to testify for the State against her so he'll have his sentence reduced.
ny	Yeah.
sd	he got off right away.
sd	And I wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that,
sd	and I won't be chosen.
sd	Hopefully .
b	Yeah.
sd	I said that, I could believe in it in certain instances, but I'd find it hard to levy that against somebody.
b	Uh huh.
sd	see I was picked for another murder trial before
sd	and you've got to come up with a decision.
qw	what do you like to cook?
b	Uh huh.
sv	That would be good for a dinner party, you know, to cook that because you don't have to deal with eight different things, coming out at once.
qy	Is that what you usually cook when you have a party.
b	Uh huh.
ba	fattening .
sd	our senior pastor and his wife came over.
sd	I really wanted to make red beans and rice with . you know, sausage,
sd	because I'm from New Orleans originally.
sd	I don't know why.
sv	I don't know if it's me or the water or the recipe I have
sd	That's what I like to make is just real neat stuff like that
sv	but, it seemed kind of boring compared ,
aa	Right.
sd	I made a roast,
sd	my husband broke the coffee pot I just bought yesterday.
sd	when Ricky and Carrie came over we made, a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit.
sd	And normally we don't eat like that during the week because of you know, the calories and the fat in it.
sd	and we had extra crust with it,
sd	it was so fattening.
sv	But, I don't think we gained any weight from it
sd	and she didn't eat it.
sd	I figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies.
sd	So, I've read a good brownie recipe.
sd	anyway, so I guess that's about what I did when I entertained.
qy	So, do you have anything else you want to say about it?
fc	well it was nice talking to you.
fc	bye.
qy	Do you have children?
b	Oh.
sd	I have one that's a freshman in high school, a daughter. And a son who's a sixth grader in a middle school.
sd	And I spend most of my time carpooling .
sd	The story of my life .
sd	my rule is that they can't play a sport the same time of the year , because there's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere.
sd	The insurance.
sd	My son, is in both band and scouts too.
ba	gee.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	We found this Oriental tile game called Mah jongg .
qy	Have you?
sd	and it's more fun with four people.
sd	So if they want to play, they have to play with mom and dad.
sd	and, we like to go miniature golfing and to movies.
sd	so we go visit both sets of grandparents and take car trips.
sd	and my husband and son go camping with scouts mostly.
sd	So that just kind of works out real well.
sd	so a lot of times, she and I will travel to writers conferences together.
aa	Yeah.
sd	So that gives us special time together too.
sd	and she gives me ideas for my writing too
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	and we still don't know what he does.
sd	So, that kind of covers it.
b	Yeah.
sd	He's been on temporary duties where he's been gone nine months.
sd	So those are the real killers.
sd	and that's mild compare to the big ones,
sd	And something major, always needs to be done.
sd	So you just have to handle it until he gets home .
sd	Well I wondered if I was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this type .
sd	I was afraid we might get into an argument.
sv	Well, I guess there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations, for, the roles of women
sv	and I guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now, And trying to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities, you know,
sv	they may be going to school, or may have elderly parents, or you know all sorts of other things.
sv	I, I think it's extremely difficult to keep up with all that we have to these days.
sd	Sometimes, I think I am going crazy trying to do it
ny	Yes.
sd^e	They are getting older now,
sd	but they are still there, you know,
sd	and you know, I still provide most of the things that go on around the house.
sd	and it was tough.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and that's where the problem is really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	I mean, I've done some of both.
sd	when my kids were real little, I was at home for a couple of different periods of time.
sd	but still at least I was able to spend, you know, those first months with them.
sd	But, I mostly went back to work because I was tired of doing without things.
sd	But, even now, I would like to not have to work in some ways.
sd	it's kind of pull and tug,
sd	on the other hand, I can't imagine just being at home, although I have a lot of interests and a lot of things I would like to pursue.
sv	still, there's sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having, you know, a job and all that goes with that.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	or are we going to keep having to try to juggle all of this?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	well I see, I think some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children.
sv	and even those who may not do it seem to be spending more time with their kids and really trying harder at making all of the family things work.
sv	I don't know if they want to completely give that up.
sv	But, it would be nice if there could be an in between, a middle ground somewhere.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think they like a routine of sorts.
sv	but it's still a long way from being what it ought to be.
fc	well I enjoyed talking to you.
fc	good bye.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and she's, sedentary all day long so when she gets home she likes to mow.
sd	and she tries to mow about half of it .
sd	because when we got this place the dirt was just overgrazed
sd	I mean, you know, it was bare dirt in a lot of places
sd	but but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in, we've reclaimed a lot of it.
sd	We have one little flower garden that we work with.
sd	The rest of it is just like wild flowers
sd	and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers.
sd	They're about, I guess, a third the size of palm of your hand
sd	and course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush.
sd	Well, my wife and I really enjoy that sort of thing.
sd	I can't believe it.
sd	I mean, I hate it .
b	Right.
sd	We don't even have any concrete or asphalt.
sd	but, you know, we do everything together.
sd	two weeks ago we got a thousand pine trees from the, you know, soil and conservation people
sd	and, we're in the process of planting
sd	and I think what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break because I tell you, in the winter time when that wind comes out of the north, it just cuts right through you like you're not even there.
sd	and we have morning glory
sd	and we planted those out by the septic, so that, they get plenty of water
sd	and we get hummingbirds come in the spring, you know, all summer long.
sd	And, well, when we leave the doors open, they fly in the house.
sd^e	they don't like it in here because there's nothing to eat
sd	and when you're as busy as one of those babies, you've got to eat most of the time.
sd	we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders.
sd	and, we've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries.
sd	Man, we get the best strawberries, that you just can't believe.
sd	We just got our last tomatoes.
aa	Yeah.
sd	Well, these are accidental tomatos.
sd	of course you're going to lose some that way
sd	and the seeds go right through them.
fp	Hi, Donna.
qy^t	Ready to get started?
sd^t	Sort of an interesting topic since I just got back from lunch here .
sd	I'm an officer in the Air Force,
sd@	and we went to the Officers' Club for a little Mexican food / * slash error with utt2: one utt
b	Yeah.
qw	If you're having a dinner party, what would you serve?
na	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qh	well, when is the party here? .
sd	It's just there's no motivation.
sd	You know, I want to throw some charcoal on the grill and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd^e	that's what they, they are shooting for here.
no	Well, I live on a lake here,
sd	and then during the summertime it's real nice to be able to entertain outdoors,
sd	so we, sort of, a, * slash error with a.54 two utts really good place to do entertaining like that.
h	but, I don't know,
sd	I had a gang of people over and kind of made a fried chicken thing and biscuits, and kind of southern food even though I'm up here in New York,
ny	Yeah.
aa^r	Yeah,
sd	it is.
qy	no kidding?
sd	Upstate.
sd	In, Griffins Air Force Base.
no@	Well, I was born in Buffalo, / * slash error with a.76; one utt
sd	and, been all over the place.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Sure.
ny^r	Yeah,
sd	I've been down to Texas a few times, and, had, the pleasure of their good Mexican, cuisine down there.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It seems to me that one of the biggest differences is the computer revolution.
sd	and we did end up with, I B M, P C s, which I now would not have chosen ,
sd	But that was before the Macintosh.
sd	And twenty years ago I was, in graduate school pecking out a dissertation on a manual typewriter .
sd	So I would say that's one of the largest changes at least in my life.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, have it punched in on those little cardboard cards which, I don't think exists anymore.
sd	You never see one of those punch cards anymore.
sv	certainly in the last thirty I would say there have been significant changes. even the change from black and white to color television.
sd	but I sure didn't have access to one.
sd	so it's close to getting, one T V per person they say .
sd	because, now I almost never watch a T V program when it's on.
sd	I can just put it on pause .
aa	Right.
sd	You skip the commercials.
sd^t	I think they just said the social, social changes in the United States.
sd^t	How was life different ten, twenty, or thirty years ago.
b	Yes.
sd	 ten years ago I was working in a job at a medical center
sd	and then you had to go find a telephone and call in to find out what they wanted you for and who you were supposed to call.
sd	and they have a little display screen that shows you a message and either tells you a person or a phone number to respond to
sd	And they have the kind that just vibrates so you can shut them off, in a theatre or something
sd	and you can still get your messages .
^h	But, let's see, social changes,
sv	I was just thinking, though, about a huge social change in the last ten years is AIDS.
sd	I know that because I was writing a paper about it.
sd	And, there was a suspicion, that it was a virus
sd	and they were really just going on epidemiological, guesswork, because the way it was transmitted made it look an awful lot like, hepatitis
sd	and then, from the spread pattern of hepatitis, they could work backwards to the transmission by, blood and semen.
sd	Well, I was in English as a matter of fact, and medieval studies,
sd	so, ten years ago I was working in the medical center, publishing a journal and writing about medical topics .
sd	And, let's see, twenty years ago, I guess we were just beginning to get into what they were calling the sex revolution after the pill
sd	Thirty years ago there was no pill.
sd	I have, four kids in college right now, children and stepchildren
sd	and I know that the expectation for them was, to have sex and, much earlier, than the expectation when I was in college.
sd	In my day, we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected might be, sleeping with their boyfriends .
sd	and it was really only, acceptable if you were engaged and planning to get married in the relatively near future.
sd	And I certainly know from talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays.
sv	And I guess the answer, is, stay flexible because nobody can predict what's going to happen in twenty years .
sd	so I sure wouldn't have been able to predict for him.
sd	And some of the other ones weren't born.
sv	Electronic mail.
sd	and that's made a difference in the way I do my job because it's so much easier to get hold of people and get quick answers to things. Even when they're on another continent.
sd	but it was used as kind of an extreme emergency
sv	and nowadays people use Fed Ex, all the time.
sd	It's much more common for people, even teenagers to be going to Europe and South America and, Asia.
sd	I was almost thirty before I got off this continent.
sd	And, both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school .
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well I have five.
aa	Right.
sd	so I really have just a thirteen year old at home.
sd	Well, I work at it .
sd	I try to fool everybody .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And that's one reason I have so many because I enjoy the big family.
sv	and it's the same type of thing,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	When things don't go right, she just calls one of them, you know.
sd	I think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and I was home more.
sd	and we did a lot of things together.
sd	we have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform.
sv	I mean, there is a competition all the time.
sd	and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, you can't afford to.
aa	Right.
aa	That's right.
sd	She had to go with me.
sd	Now I do work full time.
sd	and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other.
b	Yeah.
bh	Really?
sv	and I don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some.
qy	Is it?
bh	Really?
aa	That's what I've heard.
b	Yeah.
qw	what kind of house do you live in?
sd	And mine's about twenty seven hundred square foot.
sv	I think it's pretty much typical for this area.
sd	I'm in here right now about twelve and a half years.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	kind of hard to find one prebuilt that kind of fits those specifications.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, then, most of them don't have a three car garage.
sd	They're kind of rare.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but my husband's got a big space in between where the cars are and the house, where he has a big work shop, you know, workbench and everything.
sd	he just piddles on this and that.
sd	But he likes to have a spot to keep all of his piddling things.
aa	It really is.
sd	and I at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left, a bedroom to where I had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff,
sd	it ended up I got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something.
sd	So I didn't end up with my vacant room like I had thought I would.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time. And some of them coming back home and things, you know.
sd	so when they come, they have to have a place.
sd	At times I keep thinking, though, that might be kind of nice.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, I don't blame you for that.
sd	and then we ended up with four grandsons.
sd	And little boys are around the house a whole lot more than girls.
sd	And, I enjoy them coming, but for short doses .
sd	they know everything.
sd	But, they're fun.
sd	Well, I just watch them.
sd	I try to teach them not to get into things.
sd	Every now and then we have to kind of go and say, now don't bother this , you know.
qy	do you do a lot of camping?
b	Yeah.
b	so ,
sd	some of them are pretty rough.
sd	a lot of people I know are,
sv	but, two nights is good.
sd	so, it was pretty nice.
b	Oh.
sd	up here you got to wait until, August, until the water warms up .
sd	it's dirty you know,
sd	it's pretty funny,
sd	boy, he doesn't go in and out of the tent a hundred times . And use it as a play,
sd	they like to play in them.
aa	I don't know .
sd	we were at a beach site, too.
sd	and, up here we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime.
sd	they're so, bad.
sd	and then they all come out.
sd	We just sort of lit them.
sd	I can't see all this little, smoke buckets I call them,
sv	you can talk about that a lot,
sd	but I don't see going on a camping trip probably until next summer.
sv	So, it's easy for you to go.
ba	God .
sv	that is to have a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it, plus your tent.
b	Yep.
sv	But when you get inside they're really nice, you know,
sv	and then a big windstorm it would pick you up.
qw^d	just stay in your truck.
b	Oh.
qy	So, then, were they successful?
qy	But it took them a little while?
qy	so, did they get stuck?
bf	Well, so, they evacuated it .
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah.
sd	I know I like to get right on the water,
sd	like I say, they're just kind of more sturdy than anything, you know,
sd@	* slash error? Yeah, they're pretty nice,
o	Okay.
fx	I bet you can't guess .
co	And I want to tell you something.
sv	They're going to go somewhere pretty shortly.
sv	I think they are because they're getting better every year.
sv	And, they, got a lot,
aa	I don't think so.
sd	We went to the playoffs.
b	Yeah .
sd	now I like them, too.
qw	Who's, their quarterback?
qw^r	Who's their quarterback?
sd	but, of course, I watch every Saints game that I can watch.
sv	But I think they're really going to do good because it seems like they're finally all coming together.
sd	If they would just quit blowing it.
b	Yeah.
ba	Really bad.
sv	And I think that hurt a lot of, you know, people even wanting to play on their team.
aa^r	Right.
sd	I mean his players were constantly getting kicked off the team because of drugs, because of, you know, messing with young children
sd	and, I mean, it was just one thing it seemed like right after the other, with them.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
sv	and it was bad.
sv	because everything, I mean anything that Tom Landry wanted or had, he was going to change it.
o	But, I tell you what,
sv	Because look how good we did without a quarterback this year .
sd	Well, They, had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it.
sv	That, was the whole problem.
sv	It was, defense w , won all the games.
sd	because, you know, they gave away a lot of their drafts. For different people for, you know, other places.
sd	I hadn't heard, you know, whether they have a new one or not.
sd	But, I mean, I don't know whether they have one of the first, you know, choices of somebody,
sv	that would be real good.
sd	everybody gets in draft.
sd	But, I don't know whether they'll be far enough up where they can do any good.
sv	But we, really, I mean, really and truly we just don't have a quarterback,
sd	But, the players and stuff, they finally quit giving away the really good players and started keeping them too.
qy	you remember when Archie Manning was a quarterback?
sv	But every time we'd get a real good player they'd treat him bad.
sd@	and then he'd leave. * slash error Or either they'd trade him off to somebody else for two of these nobodies. / * sd
sv	But, this year they had all good players except for the quarterback.
sv	It was, terrible .
sv	But, all the other places, I mean, our defense was unbelievable.
qy	Did you get to watch any of their games?
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you watch it every Sunday?
qy	Did you ever get to watch any of the, New Orleans games?
sd@	I'm a, * slash error / * b
b	No.
^2	Teams in your area.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yes.
ba	my goodness.
sd	Because usually it's snowing .
sd	Ice and rain and everything.
sd	but, I mean, these games go right down to the wire.
sd	it was right close to when we was going to find out if we was going to get to be in the playoffs, or not .
sd	And they had to kick. to know whether we were going to win the game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us.
sd	You talk about people calling in.
sd	I mean, here everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair, you know,
sd	and they changed it and gave us another game in the middle of another, you know, one that was going on.
sd	The station finally, you know how they'll put the little message down at the bottom. Started telling everybody that they were not the ones that had cut that off, that it was the national, you know,
sd	but then in the fourth quarter they'd let them get up there either with them or, you know, right ahead of them.
sv	if we had a quarterback this year we would have went to the Super Bowl.
sv	And the quarterbacks just didn't do anything.
sv	But, maybe we'll get your guy.
qo	How about yourself?
b	Right.
aa	That's true.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that you know, special interest groups can blow up, and not really get down to teaching what's important.
sv	Teaching these kids, you know, really the basics is what it comes down to.
bh	Is that right?
ba	I remember.
aa	yeah.
sv	then it comes down to what you said before though about them being some of the lowest paid you know, public service, employees that there are,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	and, that's a bad word .
aa	There's an idea.
qh	Run on that then, no income taxes in Texas,
sd	I'm in Texas too,
co	but, we'll, maybe do our small part to fix them up.
sd^t	I think the topic was crime in the city.
sd	I live in a real small little place.
sd	it's about thirty miles from Sherman.
sd	It's north of Sherman.
aap	Not too far.
b	Huh uh.
na	I've been through there.
sv	but, just as far as watching the news and reading the papers and all that, it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad.
b	Huh uh.
b	Sure.
b	Huh uh.
sv	I think nowadays people really just, murder is nothing to them, you know.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
sv	because, most likely that will happen, won't it, that, you know,
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
bf	in other words, if you do something the first time, that's not real bad, you know,
bf	but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then,
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
sv	because look how many years they've been doing that
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
aa	yeah.
aa	Yeah.
aa	yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
aa	yeah.
qy^g	they just think that's the normal thing to do, don't they ...
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
ba	In the first grade .
sv	know .
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
sv	and they react to what they see at home. You know.
sv	If they see violence at home, that's what you're going to get from the kids at school.
sv	and that's kind of sad.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
b^m	Teen.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
o	think about this?
na	I do.
qy	A lot of testing?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think that's awful.
qh	What's the new criteria,
sd	It's I T B S and, just everything.
sd	but it's a very transient community.
sd	it's just north of Dallas
sd	we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now.
sd	And most of them from other places.
sd	and we just, have lots of people from everywhere. Lots of industry coming in,
sd	but I mean they do.
sv	and it's one of these things,
sd	and you know, it does.
sd	but not to where she feels different,
sd	but some of them are very rich
sd	and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are.
sv	but the kids are expected to excel in, everything.
sv	and they're expected to be.
sv	Texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system
sv	And so there's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests.
sd	They bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep and eat right in the morning before, tests.
sv(^q)	and say just do this.
sv	You know, I just feel they do better that way.
sv	but I think it's a very long day.
sv	And my feeling is that, you know, you're only a kid once, and you don't want to spend your whole life in school.
b	uh huh.
sv	I think we should do what Europe does and include cultural activities in our school system.
sv	I don't think I should have to pay for dancing lessons, gymnastics, piano.
sv	I would like to see those things included in our school system because I think we should have well rounded kids not just book smart kids.
qh	So what does that tell you?
sv	It tells you there's a whole lot of wasted time.
sv	And they could be using this time better.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's a very long day for kindergartners.
sv	But I think that working parents have kind of demanded this.
sv	You know, because they don't want to send them to daycare.
sv	That's why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day .
sv	it's just kind of a challenging game.
b	Uh huh.
sv	You do tend to, forget.
b	Yeah.
qw	What is your handicap?
sd	It's probably up there to twenty now if I start again.
sd	I don't know if it's just because I like the game or I just like to see the warm weather.
b	Uh huh.
sd	you almost have to relearn every spring to get back out.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bf	you always work on trying to improve each day
sd	but I always managed to get near par anyway.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you have, long waits, to get on the course?
b	Yeah.
sd	I, was from the, twin cities area.
qy	Are you sure you guys aren't having the bad weather?
b	Yeah.
ba	Well, I wish that's all we had.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah .
sv	Well, at least that doesn't, get in the way of golfing
sd	I'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as I have been so .
b	yeah.
bh	Really?
qw	Why?
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what happens now you,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
sd	I live right by Dallas so we have one football team as far as we're concerned .
b	That's how it is.
ny	yeah.
sv	and and, I don't think anybody roots differently
sd	and he is for the, Raiders. L A Raiders,
sd	I think I know a little more than I use to.
sd	so I'm trying .
b	Yeah.
qy^g	So I shouldn't even try to do it, ?
b	Yes.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	I don't even think we have that in Texas.
sd	I don't know.
sv	so I don't think we do.
sd	We don't even have that very much,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	yeah.
sd	I don't like to watch.
sv	and the guys get together
sv	That's fun, you know.
sv	But it can get really overdone.
sd^e	I have.
sd^e	I have.
nn	actually, no.
sd	I've done that for college football.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	And that's the thing, you know.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
aa	that's right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, well, I twirled, you know.
sd	but, you know, the last movies that I've seen were probably on video.
b	Yeah .
sd	I don't particularly care for that sort of stuff.
qy^g	he maims them pretty good, doesn't he?
sd	 I saw it,
sd	because I was told by several people that it's pretty scary and intense
sd	and I was pretty disappointed in it.
sd	but, I guess that they built me up too much. For my expectations in it there.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but, I've heard that it's real long. That it's a good movie, but it's long, like three hours.
b^m	OSCAR.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and she liked it
ny	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
sd	so, we watch a lot of movies around that category, you know that she can watch .
sd	We seen THE LITTLE MERMAID, too.
sd	And I think there's some good Disney movies fixing to come out on video, SHIPWRECKED.
sd	and, boy, I can't think of the other one that's fixing to come out.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I'm glad to know that there's somebody else out there that doesn't get to go to the movie theater .
b	Yeah.
aa@	That's right. * slash error And then they go to the dollar movies.
b	Uh huh.
sv	that does sound fun.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I don't think that I've ever heard of that movie.
qy^d	that's the one where they burn down the house or something
qy	the house explodes?
bk	okay.
sd	I can't remember the title of it, either .
qy^g^t	so I guess that's all I have to do, right .
sd^t	they kept saying you have the invalid code
sd^t	and then I found out that my new phone wasn't working right.
sd^t	so this is the first time I've even done it.
qw^t	I wonder how long it's going to be on for.
qy^t	do you know?
sd	well, I think at this point, I for one am worried about every aspect .
sd	I think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common, that's really something you got to protect yourself from.
qy	Have they done that in Garland?
sd	Well, we had a vice principal shot at here last year you know, on the school grounds after school.
sv	so you know, these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any in any neighborhood, doesn't seem like.
sd	I mean, we didn't have to worry about that before.
qh	What next?
sv	they just can't do it.
sv	I think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent
sv	and how we going to bring that back together.
b	Right
sv	and then there's a drop in, the training of morals, really, you know.
sv	some of these young kids you read about, just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all
sv	I think I think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals, you know wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood.
sv	I really do.
sd	and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both,
aa	No,
sd	but the point of the story is that, that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers, all over the country for weeks
sv	but now, you know, you wouldn't probably read about it here in Texas
sv	it's just, you know, another killing.
b	Uh huh.
sd	lots of their picture and life story and everything.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
qh	I know, how we straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible,
sd	So, that story I just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin, well, the same thing happened here in Arlington, when was it, I think it was almost a year ago in December to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with.
sd	she was a real attractive blond girl, in her freshman year of college
sd	and some boy she tried to get rid of, he was like in his twenties,
qy	Remember that?
aa^r	right,
sd	My daughter graduated with her from Arlington High School.
qh	can you believe it,
b	uh huh.
aa	Right.
qy	isn't that weird?
sv	that's not doing anything.
qy	That a little town or a bigger city?
sd	I talked to someone that was only a couple of thousand in her town, I think.
sv	I'd say, first of all, they need to go back to spending more time on the basic reading, writing, arithmetic in grade school,
qy	Do you have any?
b	Uh huh.
sd	Plano, improved greatly in the last twenty, twenty five years
sd	but I'm just speaking overall across the country.
sv	Something is definitely wrong.
sv	and they truly can't read
sv	Another problem is you're going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do.
sd	That's another thing about the United States.
sd	I mean, what they'd be teaching in an Arlington school they may not be teaching in a Plano school
sd	whereas in another one they're going to concentrate on grammar and give you a little literature,
sv	So you know, that's kind of odd to me.
sv	It depends on, what school you're in and who your teacher is, actually
sd	so I guess we lucked out when we moved here.
sv	and, you know, where our kids might be in a great school, we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read, you know.
sd	they should to do the work that she is supposed to teach, you know. and according to her plan,
sv	so I guess if there was a national curriculum we'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn.
sv	that's pretty low that there's forty eight countries ahead of us that have more citizens percentage wise that can read and write,
sv	so, unless we want to keep paying for these people that can't make it in society, we're going to have to do something.
sd	because they can't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays you know.
sd	you can't even work an answering machine if you're at work and had to get a message or something , you know, or fill out an application to work at McDonalds if you can't read.
sv	So, I think that's a start at least, going back to the basics in the early grades
sv	and that's a big jump.
qy	Did you go to school in Plano?
qy^d	Through high school.
fp	This is Archie.
qy	Have you seen DANCING WITH WOLVES?
qy	Have you ever lived in that part of the country?
qy	Have you ever visited it?
sv	I think it was the black hills of South Dakota.
no	Well, I lived in Omaha for five, winters,
sd	and that rolling kind of,
sv	apparently it's going to win everything.
sd	and I had been told, you know, you wouldn't notice that it was three hours long, and all this, kind of,
sv	and the thing is, it was, it was a good story.
sd	Although, I must admit I did look at my watch after about an hour.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I've heard that's really great, though.
nn	No,
sv	You must really keep up.
qr	or is it just suspenseful?
qy	do you listen to Gary Cogill?
qy	do you know who he is?
sd	He's a movie critic on channel eight in Dallas.
sd	and they review movies.
sd	I was listening Sunday night a little bit when, I was going to pick up my daughter.
qr	or did he just do it?
qy^d	You know, the guy when he first headed out from the army post.
sd	he plays on MURPHY BROWN.
sd	He's, he's Eldon, her housepainter.
qy	Can you, believe that?
qy	that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said, did you notice that?
sd	it was him, but with a you know, with the beard and all that stuff.
sv	it was a lot of fun.
qw^t	Why do we end this thing?
sd^t	I think it just says hang up.
qw^t	Why don't we do that?
fc	Good bye Sharon.
qy	do you think we should adopt it?
qy	You don't?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	I don't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the disadvantages that would happen to the people in America
sd	and I don't know the metric system and I don't care to learn it
sv	and I'm not some kind of an idiot,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and if I have a hard time, you know putting that into my life, can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that doesn't have any college
h	or I don't know how much of the you know,
sv	but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population they don't have any college probably much at all
sv	and if we can't take it and use it easily, well, how can you put that on, like, elderly people and you know, just people that maybe just aren't blessed with as much sharpness and mental acuity,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	The thing Americans have so much stress on them right now.
sv	I mean if you look at the average family it's, like, man, they barely have time to stop and get gas, much less to try and figure out how much gas they're really getting and do all this.
sv(^q)	It's like, I mean come on let's take the pressure,
sv	and it's just like another thing
sv	and leave them alone .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv^2	and if they don't like the way we do it just don't worry about it. And I think,
aa	yeah.
sv	I think we kept it at real good.
qy	Is that all we need to say?
fc	I think that was good.
fc	You know what I mean.
fc	And I just,
fc	Have a good day.
qw	what kind of hobbies do you have?
sd	I like cross stitch too.
sd	I just have a hard time finding any spare time lately.
b	Uh huh.
sd	He likes to help me design, you know, projects that are, a little more customized.
sv	Not that hard.
sd	I really enjoy it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sd	not very artistic really for like painting and stuff.
sd	But, now I don't know.
sd	I don't have them all yet certainly.
sd	just buy the colors that I need of what I'm low on.
sd	the pinks, there's like forty two different shades of pink.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd^e	I just started a new job and trying to get acclimated there.
qw	How old?
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, last year he was a little bit young for having one.
sv	You would have
b	yeah.
sv	that's kind of strange that we got the same call.
sv	It's a call.
bd	that's okay.
sd	I just started about, well, five years ago, I think.
sd	and I think The child is going to be in high school before I get finished.
sd	I didn't buy the, I didn't buy a kit.
sd	It's that cloth.
sd	It's cloth I think.
sd	And it has the borders and everything already.
sd	and I didn't even know it.
sd(^q)	I said didn't .
sd	It worked out that way.
b	Uh huh.
sd	She hung it on the wall.
b	Yeah .
b	Yeah.
aa	True.
fc	Okay.
fc	You too.
fc	bye bye.
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It doesn't matter to me.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	Well how did they feel about the United States intervening with Patriot missiles,
b	Uh huh .
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and fifty percent of the population is minority.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's just Hispanics here instead of Blacks.
sv	and as far as gang violence and things, I don't think it's any worse here than in Houston.
ar	Houston is not at all.
sd^e	there's quite a bit of crime.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I think it's unfortunate, as far as the Kurds are concerned,
sv	but we've kind of driven these people out.
ba	Sure.
sv	Well I think the war ended too soon.
b	Yeah.
sv	but we should have made sure we got everything.
sd	And once that was accomplished it,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I don't think this whole issue is settled as far as we're concerned.
sd	They've got sixty or so of Iraq's planes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	There are some Kurds living in Iran.
sd	I was real surprised that Israel stayed out of it as much as they did.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and from, from what I can tell if they had gotten into it, it would have started a whole new war.
fp	Hello.
qy	Did I reach the Dallas area?
qy^r	Did I reach the Dallas area?
sd	I'm from North Carolina.
sd	In Raleigh.
b	Yeah,
qw^t	how'd you find out about this?
bf^t	he works for T I.
sd	because I'm down at N C State.
sd(^q)^t	and he said, sign up and get some money and just talk for five minutes.
qy^t	So are you ready?
ad^t	let's get started.
qo	what do, what do you think we can do to solve the crime in America?
qo	but what, what are the steps?
sv	Well, see the problem is that, what happens is that you know, as you go from the country to a city, crime always increases, right?
sv	Because in the country, people still respect, the property of other people.
sv	and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city.
sv	and what we have to do is, we have to go, get some stuff, steal it, and then, you know, just resell it.
qw	Which one?
b	Yeah.
sv	a lot of it has to do with drugs.
sv	And you stop by one of these, you know, twenty four hour, you know, gas stations joints.
sv	I mean, they don't want the money so they can do something else with it.
aa	right,
bk	Okay .
b	Yeah.
sv	we're going to solve, try to solve the AIDS problem while, you know, some people are getting killed here and there
sv	But those people never get caught.
sv	and they're not going to take me alive.
sv	But I have such a big army outside of my place, that nobody can touch me.
sv	I mean, there's no connection between me and the people that were caught, you know.
aa	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	and this guy was from Jamaica, right.
sd	And he's got his little brother selling drugs .
sd(^q)	He goes, yeah, I make a lot, a lot of money,
qy	Did you see it?
sd	and within, two months, he has all his house payments gone everything paid, you know,
sd	it's like, those guys, at one point, you know, they had so much money that they didn't know what to do with it .
sd	that, that was also in the movie.
fp	So hello Mary.
fc	same here.
qy^t	Ready to talk?
^h	Okay.
sd^t	I want to talk about, our family budget, and the times that it's worked and the times that it hasn't worked and, give you a general description of it
sd	I introduced you a little bit to it, a few minutes ago, when I said that we're on the east coast now.
sd	well, we both decided we wanted to move to North Carolina.
sd	we looked at our budget,
sd	and so, what we did was draw up a budget that we thought, was realistic.
sd	and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently.
arp	Well, we actually planned for about one year.
sd	that God because, * listen it never occurred to , it never occurred to us that it would take seven months.
sd	And, what we did was just, decide how we had been spending our money before,
sd	and then we took about three months and adjusted, where we could come down and where we didn't want to come down,
sd	and we really, lessened our living expenses, more than what we thought we would.
sd	just our own design.
b	Uh huh.
sd	our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked .
ad	so. So, tell me about,
qy	do you all, have a budget?
aa	Yes.
b^m	Three and a two year old.
ba	bang.
b	Uh huh.
sv	for it to work though, you have to do something.
aa	Of course not.
sd	Well, I found, that, in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned, but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents.
sd	we tended to want to keep on giving lavish, gifts as, we had done before.
sv	And I really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself, you need to cut down somewhat on your friends.
aa	Yes.
sv	I think you have to budget those things though.
aa	Yes.
sv	although so much per month anyway.
sv	but if you don't spend it, it should be in your bank account at the end of the month .
ar^r	no.
sd	You don't want the government to spend your money.
sd	Well, but I do realize that, that is realistic for some people,
sd	and it was for us many years, for many years.
sv	and if that's the only way that will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the year then doggone it that's what you should do.
sd	Well, I was just reading an article in, a North Carolina paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at, letters of applications to universities.
sd	so, it can be done.
qy^g	Where there's a will, where there's a will, there's a way, right? .
fc	Well, I have enjoyed talking to you.
fc	we'll have to stay home and mow the yard .
fc	Bye bye.
qy^t	They tell you our topic?
sd	You've got it.
sd	and we have a cat, which is, I guess about five years old.
qo	How about you guys?
qw	what kind of birds do you have?
qy	enjoy them?
qy	You let them out and let them fly around and everything?
bk	Okay.
sd	but, we had a parakeet. And, my fault, put up our first electric fan. And never thought about it.
sd	Knocked that parakeet right out of the air.
qy	It killed him?
ba	I'll be darned.
sd	and that thing grew to be seven and a half feet in length,
sd	like, it'd been like deactivated as far as s , smell and everything,
sd	and we sold it for about two hundred and fifty dollars.
sd	but, you know, does his little jobbies in the litter box,
sv	but, they just stink too much .
sd	and this snake honestly would be stretched across the top of her body with his head right on her neck
sd	and a dog would be running around crazy .
sd	and, you know, you'd feed it, you feed him small mice to big rats and things like that
sd(^q)	I says you know, your friend's going to get our cat one of these days .
aa	me neither.
sv	and that's the way it should be,
sv	and that was just mind boggling.
bh	Are you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
ba	gosh.
ba	That's neat.
ba	Why, sure.
bf	Come to my menagerie.
qy	Do you exercise a lot?
qy	Is mowing the lawn a new exercise ?
ba	my.
sv	I think that's considered exercise whether you want it or not.
sd	I used to walk two miles a day,
sd	and I really enjoyed it.
sd	I could do it in twenty eight minutes.
sd	And that's not stopping and talking to everyone along the way,
sd	I was crawling under a desk, hooking up a computer.
sd	And I mashed it wrong, or I did something.
sd	so I can't walk.
sd(^q)	And she said, you know, the most conservative approach, you do the medicine again and again, before you think of surgery.
sd	I don't want anyone to think about that , ever.
sd	That's that microscopic stuff, you know.
sd	So, I'm being very good.
sd	I really do,
bh	really.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I can you understand that.
sd	but I will do it.
sd	I have got to be so much more careful with what I do.
sv	It's depressing.
b	Right.
sd	Maybe I can get back into it.
co^t	Let me ask you a question off the subject though.
qy	you're living in the Castle Park area?
sd	I grew up in Oak Cliff.
sd	just close to Methodist Hospital.
sd	C a n d y.
sd	in fact, I lived there until late nineteen fifties.
sd	So many people are moving back into those old houses and are restoring them.
bk	I know exactly where that is.
na	sure.
ba	that's wonderful.
ba	That is a gorgeous, gorgeous place.
ba	they are.
ba	wow.
sd	I need to go over there and just drive around and look.
sd	it was like a two story.
sd	Well, story and a half, really, because we had a basement.
sd	I mean weird .
sd	It's one of these really creative houses, that I grew up in that nothing was on the same level with anything else.
sd	And I just loved the neighborhood.
sd	They were all completely different.
sd	and so neat.
b	Oh.
qy	Is that not good?
sd(^q)	I think, you know, you're in Oak Cliff.
sd	In west Plano.
sd	And we live on one of those blocks that it's a neighborhood watch block.
sd	and the street doesn't go anywhere.
sv	If you are on the street, you better belong there. Because it's not a through street.
sd	And, still, I want to get up early in the morning and walk. Before this knee business.
sd	And my husband had a lot of heartburn with that.
sd	I mean, it looked darker to him, because he was in the house with the lights on.
sd	he didn't think it looked predawn to him.
sd	It looked dark.
sv	it's just because you're smart.
sv	That you don't do things like that.
aa	That's right.
sv	There's only one crazy out there, you know, to make any difference.
qo	What are your favorite shows?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've never seen that.
nn	Huh uh.
sd	I like L A LAW not because it's realistic, but it's entertaining.
sd	I watch CHEERS sometimes. And, mostly just movies, when there's a good movie on.
sd	Actually when there isn't a good movie on, too.
sd	I just like to have the T V on you know, if I'm home alone or something
sd	either the radio or the T V s got to be on , the whole time.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ng	well, I don't, because I work all day.
sd	after a while I'll start watching it
sd	for a while I'll ask people if they know what happened
sd	and then I'll just forget it.
sd	It was like GENERAL HOSPITAL or something
sd	and I maybe watched it for a week
sd	they wouldn't take a class that was in the middle of their soap opera.
b	Uh huh.
qw	How old?
qy^d	So, you aren't a SESAME STREET fan?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Supposed to be a great babysitter .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I never see it?
sd	that's why I don't see it.
qy	Isn't it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think are strange ?
b^r	uh huh.
qy	is it snowing up there?
b^m	No.
b	Uh huh.
qy@	Wow. But do you have snow on the ground now? / * two utts
b	Oh.
ba	Well, that's nice.
sd	we've broken all sorts of records.
sd	and it stopped raining almost twenty four hours ago.
sv	but until you've really seen it, it doesn't really hit you.
sd	and that was just
sd	it was amazing to me.
sd	in the last three years it's happened at least once a year, if not twice. But the people continue to move back in the flood zones.
sv	I mean, you got to wonder how long they're going to keep doing that for.
sv	I don't think I would.
sd	Because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood.
aa	Yeah.
ny	yeah.
qy	Have you made a lot of calls
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
qy	Do you get paid for these?
br	Five dollars a call?
sd	I wish I could do that .
qw	So what do you, think is the worst culprit for air pollution?
b	Uh huh.
sv	it's hard to put the finger on, what's worse, know, the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion, with, your hydrocarbons, causing the damage in which,
sd	Well, I notice on one of these, home shopping networks they were selling these, halogen, fire extinguishers
sd	but it's, you know, really bad on the environment.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	but they had a new policy where in order to get your your car license, renewed, you had to meet the pollution standards
sd	but I have an old car which I doubt would, pass the inspection, a seventy six,
sd	and, you know, there's no way I would put in a lot of money to repair it to meet standards.
sd	So, although I do what I can to cut down pollution,
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and in the summer time we probably get yours.
b	Yeah.
qo	What are you guys having for Christmas?
bh	you're not.
b	Yeah.
sd	I'm a pig farmer .
sd	but we're going to have, wild boar
sd	and, we're also going to have a little roast suckling pig, because I've got one that's got a hernia
sd	and rather than, you know, pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery, we'll just cook him and eat him .
sd	I'm telling you, real easy, easier than chicken.
sd	in a second they're gone
sd*	and then you just dip the carcass in, boiling water, pull it out, and we use a little raspy brush, pulls the hair off, and, gut it, and, just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and, some pineapple, about three pineapples, you know, sliced them up, and, cover him up with, wet, sacks, feed sacks is what I usually use * more than one utt?? and then start a charcoal fire on top of him.
sd	and it's the best eating you ever had.
sd^e	just like a pig
sd	This wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds
sd	and he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds.
sd	and that was about, you know, a hundred pounds of just ham.
sd	well, you know, we're not going to eat the whole thing .
sd	well her mom's doing brisket.
sd	It's a part of the cow that they used to throw away.
sd	It's just tough as a boot
sd	and, you know, they used to use it for leather, I think .
sd	I was kidding.
sd	so it's really a tough piece of meat
sd	and you marinate it for a couple of days
sd	They weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds.
sd	And, we're going to have that.
sd	we still have tomatoes
sd^e	fresh tomatoes.
sd	I mean it's thirty degrees this morning.
sd	But, it'll go up to fifty or sixty almost.
sd	So in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred, hundred and ten
sd	and at night it goes down to about sixty.
sd	we get a fifty degree temperature swing in about four hours.
sd	we got hundred year old trees that are, you know, twenty feet tall.
qo	So, how do you feel about our policy in Latin America? .
qy	Do you think, we should direct the government? .
b	Yeah .
sd	I mean it's like his mother, his, mother came over
sv	I just get sorry feelings for people that their family came from there and how they feel about, you know, our intervention and their government and stuff like that,
sd	there's so many people there that get the kind of control that's bad, you know,
sv	I mean, you know, I think the people in those country do want our help. The people that are under conditions that are, you know, not favorable to their rights.
sv	but it seems like most of them don't , you know.
b	yeah.
qy^d	So you think like C I A influence and our money over there.
sv	Or, or government aids and stuff.
sv	Well, then how can you say like in, Europe, as far as the toppling of those kinds of governments, you know, like,
b	Uh huh.
qy	or do you think that we are to the degree that we are causing .
aa	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sv	I agree that the communication that communication has, become so much more widespread and, you know, worldwide that people are realizing hey, we don't have it so good and let's stand up
sv	we're living, with these kind of conditions in a world that's advancing as fast as it is
sv(^q)	I think people are just saying, no way, we don't want anywhere of this.
sv	And I think the Catholic religion itself was such a dominant factor, as far as keeping the people down, so to speak,
sv	I mean when you a religion that most of the people go to church and they don't understand when anything is being said yet they're expected to bow down to it, I think that keeps people in sort of line, you know.
sv	I'm just saying, that, the old church.
sv	but just that, I think that it's just Latin countries are slower in coming around.
sv	they still didn't understand it though, I don't think,
sd	And you know, I can't, I don't understand Latin
sv	They're not really sure of what they are. I don't think.
qh	or why do they not, you know, stand up, so to speak, for their rights?
b	Uh huh.
sv	they've, their very vocal.
qw	So, what's the difference?
qw@	So what makes the difference between, say I mean, South Africa and it is rest of Africa? * slash error Yeah. / * b
b	Yeah.
sv	I think they tend to be more educated, much more, educated than Africa or the Latin American countries.
sd	Well, I know that Russia, they're comparably better educated than we are, in our country.
b	Yeah .
br	In our country?
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, that's just it though, good education.
qh	are we willing to pay for it, you know,
qy^d	So you have a child two years old in child care right now. * slash error Uh huh.
sd	and he just turned three months.
sd	So, we're just starting into hunting for child care.
sd	Right now, both of us are students.
sd	University of Southern Mississippi.
b	Yeah.
sd	actually spring semester a year from now he's going to have to be in child care five days a week more than likely. depending on how my class schedule runs
sd	because my wife will be doing her internship that semester.
sd	It will be forty hour week, no, eight to five type of thing.
sd	once a day this overlap happens where we can't, one of us be home.
sd	So for about twenty, thirty minutes a day we got a baby sitter comes in.
b	Uh huh .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	that makes a big difference.
aa	Yes.
b	Yeah.
sd	There's a lot of child care available, but invariably there's waiting lists.
sd	And we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with okay, the university's, department of, their Home Ec Department
sd	But, they have a pretty good size waiting list.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	a cottage industry's the best way to do it really,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And it's amazing how much good things like, Sesame Street will do.
sd	You know if it's informal I'd probably choose something, I mean, just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill * slash error two utts because that's a lot of fun, especially this time of year where it's so nice out. / * sv
sd	but I'd probably go with lasagna, a green salad, and garlic bread.
sd	but, it's kind of the bible of cooking for me.
sd	Then I have some from like church that are more family recipes that are more useful . You know, budget cookbooks,
sv	but and, of course, you get a lot from when you're growing up.
sd	of course I've added several different recipes,
qw	but, what you serve or what would you ,
ba	Well, that's good .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that would be wonderful in these times .
sv@	either they're really fast or , * slash error Uh huh.
qw	What's one of your favorites?
ba	sounds too good.
b	Yeah.
aa	that THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK.
sd	I find a lot of the cookbooks I don't know, that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients, or things I don't keep on hand all the time
sd	but I want to use simple recipes that I have things on hand,
sd	I don't have to run to the store to buy or look for something I haven't heard of .
sd	That's why sometimes I shy away from, more of a traditional cookbook
sd	Food is one of my favorite things too.
qo	Anything else you wanted to add?
ba	wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That sounds good.
ba	That sounds really good.
sd	I'm pretty simple right now,
aa	Yes
sd	and they won't eat, you know, too many different foods right now.
b	Yeah.
sd	Spaghetti's a pretty staple every other week or so
sd	and it goes a long ways too.
fc	Talk to you later maybe.
qy	do you have any special interest in, space flight?
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	What do you do now?
b	Oh.
ba	To bad, / * spelling: too
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	there's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as, you know, with the space shuttle and all. Although plans to, go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to, the sixties.
sd@	I kind of wonder if it were possible to market some, form of, space technology, you know, to make it equitable, it might severely help the economy, you know, in the, respect that , you know, there's endless amounts of research to be done. Endless amounts of resources * more than one utt and whatnot,
sv	it would be great if we could find some way to, use that to boost the economy.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	so you're talking about positive side effects then.
sd	I understand.
ba	that makes a lot of sense.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
^2	Now we're done.
sd	I don't do a lot of it.
sv	maybe I can learn something.
qy	Do you?
sd(^q)	He said, I don't think that's the different kinds of fishing they're talking about .
sd	That's about the only kind I know how to do.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Well, it sounds like you do quite a bit of it.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you have a boat?
b	Uh huh.
sd	The ones around here are so big, that you can fish off the dock
sd	but unless you have a boat you can't really get into where they call the good fishing holes, you know.
qy	Is it?
sd	I catch a lot of little old, I think they call them perch
sd	and then the, turtles try to eat up all my bait .
sd	So it's so close to the dock that I think all I do is feed them a little bit
sd	but it's kind of fun.
sd	 I would be afraid of that.
qy	Do they ever get on your hook?
qy	Are they poisonous snakes?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I think I'd be a little bit afraid of those.
sd	But it looked so bad
sd	but we sure felt like it was hurting us, just being there, you know .
sv	But they're scary looking.
sd^e	I think that, probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else.
sd	Now, they have a lot of bass tournaments.
b	Uh huh.
ba	no.
sd	and all those people are here for the tournament, you know.
sv	they're really into it to try to win.
sv	The peace and calmness is really relaxing.
b	Uh huh.
qy	so do you all keep a budget?
qy^d^m	You don't?
qrr	or are you serious?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	But, we don't, you know, live in a brand new house, either, maybe a ninety, hundred thousand dollar house
sd	but we're in a thirty year old house that would probably sell for forty five thousand.
sd	We're still paying trying to pay those off.
sd	And we have one car payment that I think we have about thirteen months left on it.
sd	And it'll work out perfect.
sd^e	we don't.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b@	 Uh huh.
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Does she have to pay to have it refinanced?
sv	so five years ago we probably looked like real ding dongs, you know.
sd	But we learned a good lesson.
sd	but would have only been about twenty dollars a month higher,
sd	so I wasn't paying as close of attention.
sv	and he has a lot of wisdom on that, just on Biblical, you know, principles to finance.
sd	And if we do take out a loan on a house in the future, what we'll do is pay twice a month on it, because you save a lot in interest, just doing that.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b^r	Right.
bh	really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	You know, he does that full time with the bank, you know.
sd	And so we're going to use people that we're in a relationship with that we know, that, you know, we know are people of integrity.
sd	and we didn't do any of those things.
b	Yeah.
b	Really.
ba	my.
sd	so I don't think it would hold any , Anyway.
sv	Maybe my husband should call today.
fp	Hello.
sd	and I'm in Richardson, Texas.
qy^d	I guess we're going to have a lot of parades this weekend in honor of these guys that did some stuff over in the Gulf.
ny	Yeah,
sd^t	I haven't pushed one yet.
sd	we're just sort of getting acquainted here.
sd	you know, I just wanted to see if, you know, you had an opinion about this,
co	so, if that's okay with you, then I'll just press one.
fp	Well, hi, .
sv	I really do. in a major way because that whole region over there, I think needs to settle it's own differences within itself.
sv	They don't understand it as we don't understand the way they live.
h	and, you know, it. well, that's, that's a couple thoughts on it.
ad	I guess, you know, I'd like you to maybe express something here.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
sd	I mean that was one thing, that came out of it, good or bad,
sv	it's just a war.
sv	and that's going to solve the whole problem.
sv	It's going to be them,
b	Yeah.
sv	that's true too,
sv	they understand violence.
sv	they just adored him, because he was so strict and cruel,
sd	and, you know, for a while there he had them, be ,
sd	I got to say, that over there,
sd	and I mean he, he is abounding in kindness, let's say.
sv	You know, and when you add the, commercialization of the western world it sort of screws everything up for them.
sd	and they just really believe in Allah, or God, or whatever.
sv	and, you know, and, it's almost like,
b	yeah.
qy^g	and that's always been the way of the world. Don't you think .
sv	So it's really hard, when you see the leaders, compared to the people.
b^r	yeah.
sv	you have to have some compassion some humanness.
sd	but, you know, for heaven sakes, that's something that's been going on for ages,
aa	that's true.
bh	Do you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
sv	Well, I do think that the cases say something like Texaco versus Pennzoil,
sv	or the Texaco Pennzoil problem, is ridiculous for people just taken off the street to understand, and, really should have some better way where people who understand both the circumstances and the complex issues involved, should handle cases like that.
bh	is that right?
sd	I was only on one jury ever, so far in my life,
sv	and it seemed to me all the time I was thinking of all these people in the courtroom over the case that involved, a couple thousand dollars I think, it was really just, terrific waste of everybody's time and money.
sd	And it finally ended up that, even though we had reached a verdict before we were allowed to give it, they settled the case.
sd	they had settled while we were deliberating.
sv	Now, the one thing I did approve of there was that we didn't have to be unanimous because it was a civil case.
sv	so, it was, a good thing that, it wasn't a total waste of time to have a hung jury on a case that trivial.
sv	Well, I think that the trial in a sense, is kind of a threat to hold over people to try to get them to reach an agreement out of court, because it does cost so much money.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Yeah.
sd	I was a witness in a criminal case.
sv	And it was absolutely horrifying to me how that operated because so much evidence was excluded,
sd	And I knew the people involved, the people who d and the people who, were defendants.
sv	I think that was just a horrible miscarriage of justice because of the, you know, staying by the absolute strict rules and not allowing things to be presented to the jury, that, were highly irrelevant to the case and could, I thought, have established the defendant's innocence.
sv	although I'm a lawyer's daughter and I have lawyer's, and judges on both sides of the family, and uncles and cousins and things like that, I really think that we have gotten into much, too legalistic of society and that we spend far too much on the fine points of the law and far too little on achieving justice.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And it seems to me that a jury can make a much more rational decision if they know somebody had fifteen convictions for a similar crime,
sv	but , the likelihood certainly tilts it .
sd	And, that was one of the things that was not allowed in the, trial I went to,
 sv	though, one of the two people who gave the perjured testimony, had a long criminal record and had been, you know, a real sleaze bag.
sd	and I know that he would have sold out his mother for, shorter sentence.
sv	and it seems to me that, maybe it's time to just scrap all the case law and go back to general principles . and start over. And then make a legal system that carefully protects people
sv	that would be wrongful .
sv	Sure would.
^2	And you think that would be relevant.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I think so,
sv	that's something I thought would be a very good idea of when juries come in they are told just to shut up and listen.
sv	And it seems to me that you'd get a lot more, information if your questions were heard, if you were allowed to ask the witnesses things, or the lawyers things or even the judge.
sv	But particularly the witnesses.
sv	They aren't testifying really in their own words,
fp	How are you?
qy	Well do you have a family budget?
sd	I'm an accountant.
sd	so, we were sort of, you know, keyed in on expenses and things like that.
sd	We have a certain budget.
sd	Excuse me. For instance, I control all the household expenses, the groceries, the haircuts, the gasoline for my car, any miscellaneous expenses, baby sitting, things like that.
sd	And, excuse me, if, it comes the end of the month and I don't have any money, we don't buy any more milk .
sd	we've been doing it a couple of years now.
sd	And I really try to stretch my dollars here and there, shopping, at warehouses sometimes, like at Sam's and things like that.
sd	but generally, we always make it.
sd	and we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not.
sd	and I can't really remember what it is.
sd	You know, every month fifteen dollars is for car fund. You know,
sd	Like I know that my washing machine is going to go any day.
sd	so if it does it's not going to kill us.
sv	so it makes those surprises not so difficult to get through.
sd	Right now, we save about twenty five percent of our pay.
sd	it's you know, for vacations like I said, for, you know, emergencies like for car, breaks down, something like that.
sd	and we also put money aside for our kids college.
sd	and just this last month we paid off my final school loan.
sd	We're starting our kids a little bit early.
qy	Do you, use a lot of credit cards or your checking account when you go out and buy things?
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's good.
sv	and it's not deductible anymore.
sv	And it seemed like we didn't have enough money when things cropped up, you know,
sd	Well the first time we did it, we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be,
sd	and then we kept track of everything for a month. You know, how much we spent on food, how much we spent on gasoline, how much we spent on everything, and from that built, you know, a cash budget.
sd	I don't remember what it is now, four hundred dollars for the month, let's say.
sd	and some months it may be different.
sd	but the way we set up, you know the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for, you know, utilities and, the house payment and all that.
sv	those are things you don't really have much control over.
sd	I mean, but again it's a set amount every month. And, on special occasions, I mean birthdays and things like that.
sv	we don't, we still have fun on things .
sd	and then, after we sold the first house, we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house.
sd	So, we got out of that one pretty easily .
sd	my husband, he's the real disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually.
sv	no .
ba	I know.
b@	right. yeah.
sd	My husband cut himself down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work.
sd	I mean, so I'd say at least, two usually three times a week he takes his lunch.
sd	The other times, he'll, I don't know go out somewhere, eat in a cafeteria or whatever.
sd	I mean, he found it's so easy to spend five dollars a day on lunch.
sd	That's a hundred dollars a month on lunch.
sd	that's twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch.
sv	I know that or how far your dollar goes probably more than anything has greatly changed.
sd	and they compared income at different points in time when the father you know, was a little bit younger and more in his heyday
sd	And even though the son was probably more successful, you know, higher up in the management ladder he was actually making less money when you go by costs of living.
sd	but my dollar went a lot farther.
b	Yeah.
sd	and now it's over a buck.
sv	but I think it's about a dollar fifteen on an average.
sd	most of the people I talk to are Texas,
b	Yeah.
sd	but, I'm pretty much out to the things to say.
ny	Yeah.
sv	but even attitudes on clothing and stuff, I know.
sd	but. I know, it was hard for me at first,
sd	but now I kind of like, you know, a lot of the bright colors.
sd	but now I do like some of these, brighter, fluorescent colors.
b	Yeah.
sv	they just, make their, circle and come back again.
sv	So if you hang onto your clothes long enough, they'll be back in style in a few years .
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, thinking back, I think the only style I hope doesn't come back is bell bottoms.
sd(^q)	I guess when I look at pictures of myself in the bell bottoms I say God.
qy	Cindy, you there?
qw	what kind of dinner parties have you had?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Whatever you like,
aa^m	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that sounds delicious.
b^m	Yeah.
sd	but they're just made out of the beef, you know. And, with spices and things in them. But never anything mixed with Bisquick.
b	Uh huh.
sd	that's my, that's my parties mostly is at Christmas time and Thanksgiving time.
sd	and then I just sliced them. You know, and had macaroni salad with, shrimp in it.
qy	Have you ever had that?
sd	and it's, in your macaroni salad that you make.
sv	The shrimp just gives it a really good flavor.
sd	I don't like the can, but the fresh.
sv	that was really good.
sv	But, at, Christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner, you know. Which is kind of hard because you got so many people
sv	it seems like everything on your plate's cold.
sd	you can, always take your plate and just heat it up, you know.
sd	you know, I have, like, maybe just another couple over for dinner.
sd	But, other than, than that I don't have, you know a whole bunch of people like except at Christmas
sd	and I have my family.
b	Uh huh.
b	right.
sd	I always like to have that, too.
sv	Everybody seems to like that, too.
sv	everybody likes that.
sd	And, then, if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven, then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there, you know. Especially if a pork roast.
sd	That's what I love, with my d ,
sd	And, other than that, in fact, I'm just thinking of what next weekend when the Super Bowl's on
sd	and I just, had been thinking what to have for that .
sd^e	not yet .
sd	I want something that I can just take them and serve them while they're sitting in front of the T V.
sd	You know, so, I'll think of something, just that we can munch on over there, you know.
sd	And they can just fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down.
b^r	yeah.
b	Yeah.
o	Okay .
sd	I'm twenty nine.
sd	like I know, when I was young most mothers pretty much were housewives, and stayed at home with the kids,
sv	and to me it seems like its almost the opposite now where the woman is working and, and they, you know, take the children to child care,
h	or maybe they work part time or something.
sv	So, that seems to be a pretty big change.
b	right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	That's true.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I know, the choice to either work or to be a mother is probably pretty difficult because I think women just naturally tend to have those instincts that you know, you protected the children, and you want to be with the children,
sd(^q)	yet there's so many material things to be had out there that a lot of people think, but, if we both work, we can get a really big house, and we can have two really nice cars, we can take a vacation, we can do this,
sd(^q)	it's kind of like, well, you know, she didn't go to college, and she's just a housewife.
sv	Even though there's probably women with M B A's, maybe even Ph D's, that are staying at home with the children.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but, there's a T V show where the man is the one raising the kids, and the wife is,
sd	but, but, there is a T V show out there.
sd	Because I know there are cases of where that happens
b	Uh huh.
sd	When, you know, the husband's the one at home raising the children, the mother works,
sv	that's not real surprising.
b	Right.
sd	because, one of the area supervisors, in my area, as a matter of fact, took off, for a couple of weeks, when his wife had their baby.
sd	Now it might have been just to take care of her and the baby, instead of having you know, a, a nurse, or someone come in, or, or something like that, mid wife or whatever they call it that they have for the first couple of weeks.
sd	but it might have just been him describing the fact that he was taking vacation days to go be a father for a little while,
sd	But, I'm not real sure how that goes.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	so I'm sure I'll be you know, one of those women in her thirties when I get around to ever getting married and having kids.
sv	I think, I think that's getting a little more common too.
b	Right.
aa@	I agree . I agree.
sd	and then it gives her a little more option if she wants to stay home with the children while they're young, and, be a mother for awhile,
sv	So, she's kind of got that option, if they wait till later, they've saved up some money,
sv	it's not as difficult for her to stay at home with the kids and live off one income, or something.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I seem to see more women in leadership type roles and management positions, in politics,
b	Yeah.
sd	Like the Mayor of Dallas is a woman.
sv	And, I'm sure that twenty years ago that never would have happened,
sv	I think, she's going to, not going to run again after this.
h	but, you just start hearing more and more.
sd	In fact, the Governor of Texas is a woman, too .
sd	We can't forget that one.
sd	Ann Richards.
sv	so, so, you're starting to see more of that
sv	but I'm sure that one of these days, well look at Ferraro ran for Vice President, and I guess one of these days, we'll eventually have,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv^t	Well, I think we've gotten our five minutes
fc	It was nice talking to you, too.
fc	Bye, bye.
qw	First, let me ask you, what's the weather like up there to begin with?
sv	That sounds more like our winter weather down here.
sv	Well, you know, I bet that's that storm we had last night.
sd	And we're expecting another one tonight.
sd	I mean it was raining so hard you could swim down the street.
sd	It was heading north.
sv	Well, it was nice today.
ny	yes.
qy	Well, you know, what they say about the weather here in Texas?
sd	if you don't like it, five minutes, it'll change.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Well, tell me, is it normally that cold up there in the Spring?
bh	You're kidding?
qy	are you sure you didn't leave your refrigerator door open?
b	Um hum.
b	Oh.
sd	Well, I, sincerely hope that you don't have that terrible storm we had.
sd	I hope, it doesn't reach you up there.
sv	well, if it's the same as what we had, at least it'll be warmer.
sv	that, whew, that would be tear disastrous. If you, had that rain storm and freezing weather.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	 yes.
sd	Well, I heard on the news this morning that, one of our local schools, lost the roof of their gymnasium.
sd	And they suspected may have been a tornado.
qy	what do they call them? the, the marching band or something?
sd	had just quit rehearsal about a half hour before.
aa	and how.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	we've had, well, past four or five years, I guess, at least one day during the year when just everything would just close down because we'd have freezing rain.
sv	And, of course people down here, they just don't know how to handle themselves
sd	but, we're don't have the equipment to handle it either.
sv	well all you can do with, freezing rain of course, is spread sand on the ice.
sd	but, you know, we don't even have vehicles that will do that.
sd@	they have to get, a truck of sand and, four or five laborers up there just spreading it by hand. * needs slash Well, and then to make matters worse, it destroys your vehicles too.
sd	They mix the salt in with the sand.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm a dog lover myself.
sv	I guess it would be.
b	Oh.
qh	wasn't that nice of him?
sd	I have, a Chowperd myself.
sd	A Chowperd.
sd	Well, she's part Chow and part Shepherd.
sv	But she's the best, the best of both breeds.
sd	Well, June, is medium sized.
sd	But she is scared to death of thunder storms.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ba	that must be nice.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, good.
sv	well, now, you know, it sounds like you ought to be in a condo down in Miami Beach somewhere. Or better yet, down around Saint Petersburg, Florida.
sd	That's what I call home.
sd	I lived there for ten years.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I lived there in the seventies.
sd	I have two sons still living down there.
b	uh huh.
sv	Well, that's, that's why I was suggesting, that Saint Petersburg got, got to be the finest weather in the world.
sd	Course you could always tell which were the natives and which ones were the snowbirds.
sd	I guess tonight's subject is, woodworking.
sd	Well, kind of, mainly the woodworking I've done lately is, made like, for example a little nativity scene. not the whole figurines and so forth, but mainly the stable, put some shelves in and some odd stuff around the house
qo	How about yourself?
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you think you would be able to do some more if you had more tools and different tools?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	a entertainment type center?
b	Oh.
b^r	right.
sd	And also with a router, you can, make ornamental facings, too better than a just straight wood edge. And,  And, casings and so forth that are real nice,
sv^r	That's good.
b	Yeah .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	a table saw does take excuse me a lot of space and is a pretty big investment.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and it's kind of, hard to get, shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room for that.
h	so, I don't know,
sv	and it's a great stress reliever.
sd	and our head football coach, Dennis Muir , used to be an assistant coach at B Y U.
sd	So I thought that was kind of an interesting coincidence.
sd	Northern State University in Aberdeen, South Dakota.
qw^h	in what major or what year?
sd	International business.
qw^d	And you?
qw	How long of a program is that?
sd	and it said that, like thirty four percent of, college students actually graduate in four years from a four year program.
sd	it took me five years.
sd	it's just only was three more classes you know,
sv	and just doesn't happen that you get out in four years.
sv	if you're going to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one, I don't think you're going to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you're down to the thirty to forty to one.
sd	it was about twenty six to one.
b	Yeah.
sd	and they knew you.
sd	but I's, I, I put that against, my high school where we had, a biology class of three hundred and fifty students
ny	Yeah
sd	it was a biology lecture class
sd	and, you know, you got a computerized test scores, multiple choice, because there's no way they could correct a three hundred fifty point short answer test you know, a three hundred fifty person short answer test.
^q	or should I know you?
qy	Do you get, a lot of tutoring,
b	Uh huh.
bf	and you still didn't get to talk to him anyway.
qw	Well, what would be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of attending college?
sv	That's excellent advice.
sv(^q)	You know, you get to the point where I'm never going to get done.
^q	and let me get out of here.
sd	I went, I turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon.
qy	Are you eating?
br	Say what?
co	and then after five minutes when the, voice comes on, we can talk all night if we want .
sv	I actually don't think that we, pay too much in this country. particularly, in this part of the country w ,
sv	and, it's kind of dumb.
sv	Well, I mean, nobody taxes groceries.
qw	Where?
qy	Is that right?
b	Right.
sd	th , there's no other country that is taxed as low as we are.
sd	I'm not sure I understand what you mean.
b	Right.
bf	you mean, lowest end of living in spite of higher taxes.
sv	probably less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	since, I send my kids to parochial school, that .
sd	That's always been a high priority .
sv	I think in places, I think in places like California, people are beginning to find that in areas that are fairly well off, if you add the, people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are, just looking for fun, people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens.
sv	I mean, people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools.
sv	But I think it's sad selfish and shortsighted.
sd	It's in regards to discussing homes.
sd	and it's in Richardson, Texas, which is north Texas or north Dallas.
sd	We moved here in seventy four and, changed locations in seventy eight.
qo	How about yourself?
sv^e	it's a nice area.
qy	Are you finding it tough trying to find what you want
ba	boy.
b	right.
b	Sure.
sd	but anyway, my youngest is getting married this year graduating college,
sd	so I can board up their rooms, and look forward to retirement maybe.
sd	so, we're looking forward to retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to Florida or somewhere. closer to our families.
sd	but my wife's parents are from the New York, New Jersey area
sd	but everyone has seem to relocated down that area.
sv	Seems like a nice place to go .
bf	You need very minimum four and probably five.
b	Right.
qy^g	It's tough to find a five and six bedroom house, isn't it?
sv	and it's that's an awful lot, you know .
b	Right.
sd	and there were seven kids in her family.
sd	but they always seemed to get along fine, you know.
sv	then I'd go look because women seem to like to look a lot more than men do.
b	I understand that.
sd	I represent fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies.
qw	who are you with?
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, great.
qy^d	you say you lived in the Denver area before?
qw	How did that compare with this area as far as housing prices?
ba	No kidding.
qw	So what kind of weather have you had in Dallas? .
sd	I've had to use the air conditioner in March,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^g@	but I think it's higher than usual, isn't it? Yeah,
sv	nor , I think the weather overall has been, like you said, probably a little bit warm
sv	so it's real hard to,
aa	I know.
sv	and I wish it would stay like this all the time .
sv	And, gah, I don't think we can say anything else really.
fc	Well, you have a nice day.
fc	And we'll talk to you later.
qw	What type of things do you feel would invade your privacy every day?
sv	That is really an invasion of privacy.
sd	I find it very annoying when I've worked all day to come in and my phone to ring constantly, the solicitors, and the carpet cleaning companies and,
qy	Does that happen in your part of the country?
sd	I, I come home
sd	and I can't do anything but answer the telephone.
sd	but I don't know what to do to stop it.
sv	They would think it didn't mean them, I guess.
^q	Everybody but me .
qy	do you live at home with your parents?
b^m	Uh huh.
qy^d	So your privacy is invaded probably by other members of the family.
qw	Now what can you do to stop that?
aa	No.
qy^d	Just have to live with it, I guess.
sv	and maybe they will respect yours
qy	Do you have brothers?
sd	and they nearly drove me crazy listening to telephone conversations
sd	and then they would go get on the other extension
sd	but I couldn't get them to hang up, you know.
sd	Even in the office I, find that people walk up and when you're on a conversation instead of walking off or just making themselves busy, they'll stand there and listen to what you say until you hang up.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Let's see, I can't think of anything else I'd really consider an invasion of privacy other than the phone solicitors.
sd	About the only thing that really bothers me I don't have that many people coming to my door.
sd	and we live in a neighborhood where there is not any little kids to bother me, since mine are all grown up,
sv	Well, I guess traffic could be an annoyance.
qy	Do you have a lot of traffic in your area?
sd	and you would like to, feel like it's an invasion of privacy because you can't even ride down the road without people all the way around you, you know.
sv	and pretty noisy.
sv	It really is.
sd	because at first you'd hear a lot of noise, especially at night you know, when you go to bed.
sv	but I guess I have gotten used to it because I don't even hear it anymore.
sd	And, I just close it out, I guess, because I don't remember waking up in several years at night when I'd hear a fire truck go by, you know.
sv	I think they would probably have to pull into my drive before it bothered me .
qy^d	They would have to chop down the door and get you out, I guess. .
qw	Let's see. What else is an invasion?
b	Oh.
qy	Well, did you have has name all over them?
bf	That was yours.
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there?
qy	you mean for like smog and stuff?
b	Uh huh.
qo	What do you think of the greenhouse effect that's going on?
sd	that's causing the hole in the ozone.
qy^g	it is scary though, isn't it?
b	Right.
qy^g	That's up there by Kentucky, isn't it?
ny	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
sd	But Kentucky, we use to have I mean, just real cold, cold winters
sv	They freak out when there's snow on the ground .
br^m	Amarillo?
sd	Well that's close to here.
qw	How long have you been in Raleigh?
qw	Well, how old are you?
sd	Well, we're the same age.
^g	Okay?
sd	and traffic slows down to nothing.
sv	and of course the people down in south, they're not used to cold weather and stuff,
sv	And you know, you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road .
sd	Now of course, you know, T I is here, Oscar Mayer
sd	but I don't see much pollution going on.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, see, they have what is it a test, or something like that they call it.
sv	And, that's supposed to cut down on it.
bf	school buses and the commercial buses,
sv	Well, they're burning that diesel fuel is what it is.
sv	And, it gets bad.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, that's a good idea.
sv	Well, the, you know, pregnant women aren't supposed to walk along a highway because of that smoke fumes.
sd	I was walking home from, the college I was going to in Kentucky.
sd	and I'd be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway.
sv	it's probably a lot worse now.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you, smoke?
bk	yeah,
bf	because you do smoke one a day.
qy^d	For the air pollution.
sv	Course, Texas, we don't have a bunch of pollution.
sd	But, too, we've got that air coming in off the coast.
sd	And you know it'd blow it up north.
sv	So, maybe that's part of the reason it's not so bad down here.
qy^g	it would seem like it would be the same way on the California coastline, wouldn't it?
b	Uh huh.
sv	But they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially.
sd	especially, it's usually for the young children and the old people older old people.
qy^d	It is?
b	Oh.
sd	well, this is pretty wooded area down here
sd	but they've got, you know, down by the Denison Dam there's a lot of,
qy^d	They do?
sd	They live close then.
qy^d	In Durant, Oklahoma?
qy^d	you go to visit them?
bk	Oh.
qy	You know what the best indoor purifying plant is for smoke and stuff?
sd	It's a philodendron.
sv	It's supposed to filter the air for you, in your home.
sd	My husband bought it for me when my daughter was born four months ago.
sd^e	I do.
sd^e	I do.
sd	I did cut down a lot .
sd	and smoking, I got in the habit of it when I was about thirteen.
sv	and it's so different from Kentucky
sd	and he got me into it.
qw	How'd you get into it?
sd	I like talking to new people.
sd	I've had to hang up and stuff.
sd	I talked to people from, well, what, Carolina now up in, Boston, and New York,
nn	No.
sd	Boston, Massachusetts .
sv	I guess, it's because T I s down here.
sd	so we went from Kentucky to Louisiana down here to Texas,
sd	and his family's down here.
sd	We're out of the service now.
sd	he went to Panama when Noriega was doing all that.
qy	Dee, are you familiar with the Latin American policies?
sd	so they leave the bats, you know.
b	Uh huh.
sv	you would be safe to say that they were just very very, you know, big into drugs.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	and so the people are trying to override that, I mean not just the Christians, but all the people because they see when a righteous man is in authority, the people rejoice.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	They don't allow people to move in, like less nations, you know,
sv	you could just look at it and say they're not going to be able to pay us back.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but you don't go making billions of dollars of loans in, to people that you can just look at the situation,
sv	There's been a real revival in Mexico City since that earthquake, because you know there's a lot of sin in those nations and lots of witchcraft, a lot of witchcraft. A whole lot of witchcraft. So, a lot of it in the name of Christianity.
sv	and that's pretty of heavy duty.
sv(^q)	} you think, wow there is where they did sacrifices to false Gods.
qy	is this something that concerns you?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right .
sv	but I know the murder rate is going up every year in Dallas
sd	and that worries me.
b	Yeah.
sd	there's a little boy just got shot and killed like last weekend down in what they call the projects, which is you know, sort of a bad area.
sd	and he got hit and killed by a stray bullet.
sv	so you know it must be frus , frustrating for the parents who can't get out of a situation like that.
sv	It'd be so scary.
sv	I think that's part of the problem.
ad	But I say, you know, they commit crimes let them be overcrowded, you know let them suffer a little bit.
sv	I think if they knew it was going to be really horrible, wherever they were going, maybe they'd think twice about doing it.
sv	You know, the other thing that worries about it is, kids that are doing such bad crimes so young, you know, like eleven and twelve and thirteen year olds that just go out and kill people.
sd	I wonder what the next generation will be like.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
o@	Seems like if they had more immediate, consequences to their actions it would sink in faster . Really,
sv	because it seems like now, even in the country, you hear about bad things happening.
sd	and they've had some drive by shootings outside of the schools.
sd	Me either .
sv	but now they're so much into selling drugs and weapons and all that,
sv	it's pretty scary.
bf	those machine guns and all that.
sv	It's a wonder there's anybody who's willing to be a policeman anymore.
sd	and they keep leaving.
bf	, they figure, what a heyday, .
fc	But it was nice talking to you .
fc	same for you.
o	Okay
ad	tell me about the car that you've got.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and surprisingly it's also an eighty four
br	I'm sorry what?
sd	it's not a hatchback,
ny	yeah
sd	Big roomy trunk
sv	I think they're extraordinarily reliable cars.
sd	and I have a daughter that lives down in North Carolina
sv	and it's just an absolutely wild highway.
b	Yeah
b	Uh huh.
sd	so having precious cargo in the car with me , as you can well imagine, it's very hard for me to imagine that, a Honda's going to be as safe a car as the one that I've got my eye on, which is a Volvo.
sd	in fact, quite frankly I've owned a Volvo in the past,
sv	And I guess that's one thing that recommends the Honda to a lot of people, is there's just very little that you have to do under the hood,
sv	It's really amazing.
sv	It's, ,
sv	and I think that it's very surprising some of these very expensive Volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you're willing to buy ones that are about, the vintage of the cars that you and I currently own
sd	You can still get, even the low end wagons, for less than twenty thousand dollars
sd	in the Washington area, of course, being as affluent as it is, there are lots and lots of Volvo dealerships down here
sd	and so, } anyway, and that's the other thing is that I've never really been too terribly much of a new car person.
sd	and it's I mean, an eighty four.
b	Yeah.
qy	you ready for this?
sd	we get to talk about the weather .
b	Uh huh.
bh	you do
qy^d	so you, you probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather.
qy^d	I imagine it's kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather.
sd	Well, actually I'm, I've heard on the news that we, will be setting a record here in the State of Texas for the, large amounts of rain and moisture we've had this year, that it's going to break all kind of records that were set, set back since nineteen thirty two.
sv	and I understand it's supposed to rain until Saturday night.
b	yes.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
qy	And so are you an airline pilot?
ba	great.
sd	I have a brother that's a pilot, also, with American.
qy^d	So I imagine with all this kind of weather it, makes it kind of dangerous for you.
aa	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and it's spectacular the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time, the torrents of rain.
br	Pardon me?
sd	I've never seen a thunder show like I've seen down here before in Texas.
sd	but you can excuse me, see the lightening going horizontally across the sky and back and forth, and what a light show.
sv	it's fabulous.
sv	that's true.
sd	and that's a very arid climate, from, Salt Lake City area
sd	and so there was an awful lot of snow,
sd	and because it was an arid climate, the snow was always a crisp, powder, light snow which made it fantastic for skiing and sleigh riding and everything else.
sd	So, we had a great time.
sd^e	in, in Snowbird and Solitude and and Brighton and yes, all those areas.
qy	So I imagine, have you skied before?
bk	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Well, do you think the, the weather is typical for this time of the year?
b	Yeah.
sv	There was a time, though, in the, middle part of November that got really cool, really, really unseasonably cool
sd	and I thought, great
^q	it froze in fact.
sd	and it's not as severe, I should say as the weather that I've experienced up in northern Utah.
qy^d	Down here?
qy^d	Not in Minnesota .
sd	and they say, boy, six months out of the year it's bitter cold, and and the wind and the blowing snow and everything.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And, you know, you really will see people in jeans one day and business suits the next.
b	Yeah.
sd	and, and, you know, if I know that they're going to be there, you know, I try to really watch it and like you say, you know, really dress up
sd	I've been doing a lot of reorganization, you know, the last couple of months the same way you are, you know,
sv	and it's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress.
sv	It is
b	Uh huh.
ba	no.
ba	no .
sv	It sounds like Mister Power Hungry.
sd	You know, just yesterday, though, I saw a girl in the spine out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts.
^q	This is shorts, you know.
^q	It sure would be cool and comfortable to wear, you know,
b	Yeah.
sv	just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore, you know.
sv	Well I think T I's dress code is pretty lax considering everything, anyway, you know,
qy	do they really?
ba	my God.
sd	I couldn't afford to work there.
ba	no.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know, that's it.
ba	Wow.
sv	but it's I do, I can get so much more done if I'm dressed comfortable, you know.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	yuck.
sd	and they're in jeans,
ba	Really, wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bh	Isn't that funny.
ba	That's great.
b	Yeah.
sv	I mean that's the smart way to do it.
h	or it would me, you know.
aa	It really is.
b	yeah.
sd	I'm really looking forward to it.
ft	Well thanks a lot.
qy	Do we get our money's worth?
qy	did you see SIXTY MINUTES last night?
sv	And, it's staggering.
sv	Well, there are a lot of things that people, I think general,
sv	and and generally, I think what's interesting is that we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government
sv	and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with.
sv	I mean, we are going to have to change the people who represent us.
sv	I mean, and I think it's going to be real interesting to see and then force upon them,
sv	right that's I think that's the only thing that's going to change it.
sv	Our anger is going to have to give rise to more activity on our part.
sv	Most people in this country are getting worse off, not better off.
sv	That's not a formula for a better society.
sv	And the government really plays a role in this.
ar	I mean, they are the people whose strings are pulled and by I guess powerful intere ,
sd	and people can call in and say what they think about what's going on in this country.
sd	They expect, opening it for one hour, that they'll get three, hundred thousand telephone calls.
sv	And I've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to create an eight hundred number for voters to call and vent their frustration with government. Like one, eight hundred capitol or something like that. You know, just a number you could call from anywhere, anytime.
sv(^q)	and I think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved, like allowing us to call a toll free number and say, hey, look, do it this way, not that way, or I like this, or I don't like that, or this is how I feel about your spending my money on art that I don't think is art.
sv	So the more we communicate, hey, look, we want a change here, because, you know, as it turns out, we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country.
sd	Over a very long period of time.
b	Right.
o	Okay.
qw^r	What's your view?
sv	You know, even if they give it a shot, it's still going to be black market all over the place, you know,
sv	but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there I would think.
ny	Yeah.
b	well. .
sd	and man, There's no way I would ever go for a total ban on all weapons.
h	I don't know.
sd	I keep a thirty eight in my truck, you know.
sv	and you know, both areas are pretty crime ridden right now
sd	and it's just, you never know who is out there.
sd	and then of course there's the hunting issue,
qw	What do you do, Jeff?
bh	yeah.
bk	All right.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	I'm, researcher of Honeywell up here.
qy	You guys , do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything
sd	You know that's something I miss quite a bit.
sv	I guess that what the scale now is, it's zero for a complete,
sv	I guess I am about eight or nine .
sv	no doubt about it
b	Yeah.
sd	I guess they passed a couple of, laws here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period where you know you go to buy a hand gun
sd	and that's a week
sv	You know, you always be able to get around
sv	I guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like I'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon.
sv	I think those have been pretty much, you know, banned altogether anyway.
sv	It kind of takes the sport out of hunting .
qh	You know, it's like what can you do with that, that you can't do in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve.
sv	You know, you might do the same thing.
sv	For me I would much rather have a bow anytime .
sv	and I think it's more of a challenge, you know.
sv	I guess it keeps the shell makers in business.
sd	Anyway, that's about where I stand .
qy	Is it seven o'clock there?
qy	You guys central?
sd	It's kind of rainy actually.
sd	Around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about, I don't know, ten or twenty degrees
sd	Ice is starting to melt and stuff like that
qw	Where have you been on a wonderful vacation?
sd	that's where we go home, too.
sd	That's where we go.
sd	my husband's family lives just off of Academy Boulevard at Maize land.
ny	Yes.
sd	and it was twenty seven below.
sd	So we had to cancel our ski lessons .
bh	Really?
qy	just this year?
ba	my,
sv	So that wouldn't be a good spot to go on a vacation, now if you were a skier.
b	Uh huh.
b	No.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
sd	It was all part of the package.
sd	and it was really oriented toward little kids.
sv	and, you know it was just a lot of fun.
sd	and then landed at Cape Canaveral and then drove over to Orlando and spent four days at Disney.
aa	Yes.
sd	and kids are really cheaper, too.
sd	and the ship that was available, the only, rooms that hadn't been booked were the suites.
sd	So we got the suites at the same price as a regular cabin.
sd	so we turned a seven day trip into ten
sd	and they paid for everything.
aa	Yes.
sv	So that was a wonderful vacation.
qo	Well, what kind of things do you like to do when you go to Colorado?
b	Yes.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I think one of the places I always hit in Colorado, is that current outlet store.
br	That's what,
qy^d	with the Santa Claus on the cover.
sd	but we will probably be going up at Thanksgiving this year,
sd	Texas.
sd	I'm in the Dallas area. In Plano.
sd	 so that's not too far.
b	Oh.
aa	Yes.
sd	We left on the eighteenth, right before that big snow storm hit Colorado
sd	and we pulled in just as it hit.
qy	Do you go up through the Raton Pass, when you go up there?
sd	That's on like Route two eighty seven or something like that.
sd	We went up, through Oklahoma City and then up through, Kansas, and then turned left and went in on I Seventy
sd	It was a little more mile wise
sd	that's my main objectives normally. Whoever is willing to deal and give me a good price.
b	Uh huh.
sv	But I still think I'm going to get probably a hundred fifty thousand or more out of it.
sd	so I don't have to buy one too often.
sv	I'll probably have, three, four hundred thousand before it wants to die.
sv	but it runs good.
b	Yeah.
qy	did they tell you our topic?
bk	Okay,
^q	and what kind of decision do you think about you know, pick that car out and why.
b	Okay.
sd(^q)	so he always said why don't you drive a Ford, or why don't you try a Lincoln
sd	and I like it.
bh	are you?
b	Uh huh.
sd	so I like a little heavier car
sd	So that's why I choose, you know, to drive a heavier car and more luxury car.
sd	I will probably get a Cadillac the next time quite honestly.
sv	but, there's just something about that Cadillac that, whether it's a G M C product or whatever. Seems they handle better.
aa	I think so, too.
sd	they really do.
sd	it comes to the simple things like front end alignments
sd	I don't know why whether I just seem to drive them better or what,
sv	They always appear to hold well.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Did you.
sd	I do miss that.
aa	Well, you're right.
sd	and that's where I put my samples because trunks just aren't big enough.
sd	and it's a deep trunk, but not as broad as the Cadillac.
ba	good.
qy^d	They went all the way down?
ba	Well, that's good.
ba	That's good.
sd	I sell gun cases and things like that
sd	that's about the same size as a golf club.
sd	samples need to stretch out and gun cases and things like that
nn	Nope.
b	Right.
sd	a Continental has more trunk space.
qy	You always have leather interiors on your Cadillacs?
sd	I like leather interiors also.
b	Uh huh.
qw	what would you say?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qw	how do you feel that is for someone at that phase in their life?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	one of the reasons it's taken so long is I've been working you know, sort of half working and source of income and stuff,
sd	so I'm actually managing to do this with zero debt.
sv	you couldn't do it otherwise.
sv	I think if there's any major piece of advice is to find a way of getting an education that doesn't incur that kind of debt.
sd	I mean, I remember seeing an article one time about, you know, if the average person who spent that much money going to college just took the same amount of money and put it a, in an investment fund, they'd be considerably wealthier than they would be from the job they'd get after college.
sv	So, it's really kind of crazy.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
sd	I heard of it.
b	Uh uh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah.
sv	but you eventually forget most of it.
sv	as you said for someone you know, a more, you know, who needs to learn self discipline and so forth would be appropriate for them.
^2	and want to develop that.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah.
sd	I really do.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	in high school everyone sort of tries to have the same opinion it seems.
sv	and , they're just like, you know, someone from the country lost in the big city,
sd	and then I transferred to a very large school.
sd	I went from you know, a second rate institution to a higher rate institution.
sd	and I needed really simple education that you can get, pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years.
sd	I mean I see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having psychological problems, that, you think this isn't sinking in.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah.
sv	it's sort of a rare select environment.
b	Yeah.
aa	sure.
sd	It's a top rated institution
b^r	uh huh.
sd	Well, I had known a lot of undergraduates who pick schools because they want the best reputation for a school. Not realizing that the reputation for M I T is because of the doctorate research, and the professors who go there,
sd	and you're not going to see the professors
sv	and they think what the best is, is, reputation for research
sd	but it's not relevant, to what they need.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	you won't get that at M I T virtually or anything like that.
sv	you know, and you can't blame the professors either, because you look at their job description,
sv	teaching is third down on the list of importance things
sv	and that's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research, because it's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time.
sd	People who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that's their job.
b	Uh huh.
qo	Well, how do you feel about, drug testing?
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean, I don't want to be around people who are really on drugs and that sort of thing,
sd	but I don't really like having to do it.
sv	And I don't like the idea of it, it's, makes too much of a big brother type of thing.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
h	But, you know, it's one of those things.
b	Yeah.
sv	Plus, I guess, if they are in problem enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time, then the company has lost what they've put into that employee, and their expertise or whatever.
b	Yeah.
qrr	or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it?
sd	Well, you know, if they have time enough they can, stay off of it.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	boy, they just really, you know , let them have it from one end to the other, vehemently
sv	but I don't think they probably feel any differently,
sd	and some of them did quit the company.
b	True.
sd	I wouldn't like anything of that nature, you know,
ad	don't tell me what to do, you know.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, I guess too if I thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem, then that would be one thing. But I think it's too minor and too, you know,
sv	in the whole scope of things this isn't going to have any real affect on, what's going on in the street.
b	Yeah.
sd	I would just be irate if they said it was positive and I knew it wasn't,
sd	you know, that just really rubbed me the wrong way.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
aa	No.
sd	and you know what that is,
sd	that's not allowed.
sd	You know, that's totally out.
b	Uh huh.
sv^t	Well, I guess we've exhausted that one.
fc	enjoyed talking to you.
fc	Good bye.
sv	And when, difficult decisions, are made, they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on.
sd	they are down to as small as six people I think, in petty, in, in, in minor felonies, and misdemeanor trials.
sv	I think that the judges should be left to do most of the sentencing, simply because, there is always, there is, there is always a jury that might be swayed, by the moment, either to be too lenient or too vengeful, I guess.
sv	if, if they keep giving everybody hundred year sentences, and the people in various states, it does not seem that people want to be taxed to build more prisons. Or even for that matter, repair the lack of judges and, and other,
aa	you know, that might be it.
sd	And the eighteen years will, translate into something like, four point seven, if the, if the prisoner is a model prisoner,
sv	Plus, I guess, there was some credit for time this guy had already spent in jail waiting for trial.
sv	it just seems to me that from what I read, only about ninety percent of the ca , only about ten percent of the cases come for trial anyway.
sv	or less than half the trials that go to, less than half the cases that go to trial, end up with, with the jury actually making the verdict.
sv	or most of the cases are plea bargained anyway.
qrr	Or do you know in Virginia if they have smaller juries
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	But I know you have a right to ask for a jury in, in any sort of a case that even where damages are, are, are the result of some sort of an action that you are bringing against someone else. You can ask for that to be heard before a jury.
sv	Takes a heck of a long time, I guess, to get there in some states.
sd	Because I guess, everywhere I read that there is a shortage of judges.
sd	Or, and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the clerk, court clerks.
sd	The more I verbalize it, I do not think I would want to change the system.
sd	I do not know what we would replace it with .
b	Yes.
sd	I mean I do no think I could handle prison.
sv	I mean it would be very difficult,
sv	Well, there must be a, ca , a, a, a very great degree of that.
sv	I mean it seems to me that, that when a jury makes a decision, they should not be asked, before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision.
sv	But I would think if I did anything, I would protect the juror from any sort of an inquisition after .
sd	I was there during the trial actually,
b^r	yeah.
sd	I felt, I felt,
sd	I think they only, found him guilty on one count. which was a class something felony. Which was not even punishable, to the degree that they thought it.
sd	I mean, I, I am not making excuses for .
sv	That might be it.
fc	All right, nice talking with you.
ft	Thank you.
sd	and I usually, when I hear about a movie that's supposed to be very good even if it's in a genre I don't like,
sd	I figure, well, I should go see it, because if this is, you know, the best of the genre and I should know about it, or something like that
sd(^q)	and I usually come away thinking, no I really don't like this show .
b	Yeah.
b^r	yeah.
sd	Well, the problem I had with the movie was the problem I've had with a lot of, I guess, Hollywood movies which is they are, it's a formula movie,
sv	and they're making the movie according to certain formula that's a good formula
sd	I mean here's the situation of this kid at home, you know,
sd	it's a classic slapstick situation with these bungling burglars trying to get in
sv	but given the size of the house and how clever the kid was, it seems to me they could have done a lot more, I mean, you know, basically stepping on things and yelling in pain
sv	and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sv	so we may see more slapstick.
qy	have you ever seen any of the movies?
sd	The French movies that .
sd	I'm not with you so far,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
sd	Yes they like your Lewis much to the chagrin of sophisticated American everywhere.
sv	there's something about the human character in it
sv	There was a lot of the human character when he was home alone and he was trying 
sv	but when it was, the real slapstick moments, him versus the criminals kind of thing, it just sort of lost the human element and became purely a caricature
qy	does that make since to you?
qy	Did you go with kids though?
qy^m	Did you go with kids?
qy	Did you take kids along?
sd	I would have liked to have a kid with me, I think, preferably someone seven or eight just to get a sense for, you know, how it affected them. especially to come home
sd	I'm sure.
^2	TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	And your cousin's a kid,
b	Uh huh.
ba	isn't it amazing.
sd	it was all bloodless
sd	and the good guys can get hit all day long
sd	and they have to shake it off
sd	they don't, you know, get, epileptics, that sort of thing from getting hit on their head
sd	partly it's supposed to be a little bit more okay because it's comic book on the other hand it makes it seem like,
sd	but the aftermath is usually not there.
sd	So you see people who are severely injured, very, very badly, lose control of body functions
sv	even the movies that want to show violence as real, they don't really show you what happens with that real violence
h	and I'm not really sure how I feel about that.
sd(^q)	on the other hand I wouldn't want people who currently get sort of enjoy their violence fixes from these movies to start thinking gee, now we want to see the aftermath all the time either.
sd	and I guess I'm a bit of a snob, they make the movies good enough to be successful
sv	and they, but they could make them better, you know
sv	I mean, as far as I was concerned, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES could have been a classic of world theater
sv	it was a classic Greek, you know, you know, a sort of, European mess going back three thousand years that they're playing with
sd(^q)	and he told them, , remember, you were united, you can succeed, individually you will fail
sd	then they had to have the Master beat him
sd	according to the classic myth, the sort of Joseph Campbell type myth, he, the Master should have died at the end because the lesson was passed to the young generation
sd	and on and on, and all this wonderful mess
sv	and it would have make it, broadened the audience that it could have been targeted for, I thought
sv	I realize that. I mean, to go to these movies and expect them to be, you know, other than just good entertainment kind of thing.
b^r	yeah.
sd	I, I'm actually originally from Hollywood,
sd	and then, perhaps it's unfair, because I, I must admit I enjoy these movies
sd	and then after the movie's over, I remember it so terribly well because it had some meaning to me or something.
b	Uh huh.
h	I don't know what it is
h	I mean, I don't know if this is old fart talking here or something, because I'm not that old ,
sv	you know, those old movies seemed to have had something that was memorable somehow,
fc	well, thanks for hearing me rap, I guess .
fc	nice talking with you.
sd^e	I'm in California .
sd	there must be Texas people, as near as I can tell.
sd	well, I'm from the .
qo	How do you feel about it?
b	Yeah.
sv	I think that's just part of their overall educational process, is to get out and see and do things.
sd(^q)	And it's helps, I think, the children when they're learning in school, to say, well, I've been there and I've seen that.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah,
b	Yes.
sd	And even now with my grandchildren, I feel it's a very important thing to be done.
b	Yeah.
sd	A real point of pride with me.
b	Oh.
sd	So, we're kind of far apart here.
sd^t	and when I signed up for it, it, looked like it could make a real contribution in participating.
b	Yeah.
sd	and, again, this is our home area.
sd	So, wound up back about two hundred miles away from where we started out.
fc	It's been a pleasure talking with you.
ft	Thank you.
fc	Bye.
sd	I have only like two or three favorite television shows.
sd	I think one of my favorite then is from the guy Stephen, is it Brochco, who does like L A LAW
sd	and, he also did HILLSTREET BLUES.
sd	I like those type of shows.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think they're different than a lot of other shows of which they have like the re runs in the middle of the season
sd	and then towards the end when everybody else is showing reruns, they start showing some of their newer stuff.
qy^d	and so you must watch a lot of, Disney or cartoons then?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	they're getting close to the teenage years.
sv	but even some of your, cartoons can be very violent
sd	and, we were watching, gosh, BUGS BUNNY just last night
sd	and one of the things was to kill the rabbit
sv	And I thought, gee whiz, if a little kid was watching this, you know, that would be pretty violent even for a small child.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	Well, I don't think cartoons portray that
sd	A cat has nine lives
sd	but, we've gotten,
ad	go ahead.
b	Uh huh.
qw^d@	I don't know where you're at * should be slash unit because B orients to it, and following utt by A couldn't be made without info from B Dallas,
sd	you know, that's about how disinterested I had become.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
qy	Was it actually based on a book?
o^r	okay,
b	right.
aa^r	that's true.
qy^d	You know, and if you notice on DALLAS, they lost all the women.
sv	well, anyway that's a whole new issue .
sd	the only thing I don't like about it, especially with teenagers, is all the violence, the sex, the nudity and the curse words you know.
sv	So, they had to have picked them up from, the T V.
sv	One nice thing though about the cable company we use, they have that little parental, key,
sd	and I keep the keys with me.
sv	Because their natural curiosity, you know, to go towards that way and want
b^m	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	well, and here lately it hasn't been that cool anyway with the humidity being so high.
fc	Well, it was nice talking to you.
fc	talk with you later.
sd	This is a real first .
qy	Are you at work?
^q	I'll try the middle of the afternoon.
qy	Well, do you have any, opinion on the subject?
b	Oh.
sd	I'm really uninformed.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
qy^g	I know a lot of their countries that they had overtaken, or wanted to be independent or several of them, right,
qy	are they,
sd	I thought they were.
qy^d	but, the Ukraine is especially significant because of the agriculture?
qy^d	so there were probably really fight to keep it in if they could.
sd	they don't,
qy^g	And Bush has already given his opinion on it, right?
qy	Didn't I read that?
sv	but I guess people do that when they're desperate.
sv	I guess when the veterans went to Washington
sd	Things are not so good in Texas job wise.
sv	and it's pretty scary.
sd	I know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we don't
sv	and so I assume that that has some effect. Or a great effect.
sd	the statistics prove that
sv	Maybe they should pay more attention or, you know, to the more equalization of the trade.
sd	Of course, if somebody in China can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have unions, well, I don't know what's going to happen then.
b	Right.
^2	And child labor.
qw	What do you think has caused our horrible situation?
^2	One thing.
sd	I mean, I've read that is a theory.
sd	but, I'm tending to go straight back into my original democratic party.
sd	but now it's looking better to me.
sd	I'm glad to hear that.
sd	I just, admire her a lot.
sv	But she's, you know, probably more popular out of the state than she is here, although she did manage to win.
ad	But look who she was running against, you know .
qy	What you mean, my voice?
sd	I am from Kentucky. Originally .
sd	We are going to mow and trim and edge,
sd	and that is all we have been doing all weekend.
b	Uh huh.
qw	how many kids do you have?
bk	Okay.
qw	I mean, how old are they?
ba	Goodness.
sd	I have got a four year old and a four month old. And an eight year old stepdaughter.
sd	Well, you do not have to tend to him.
qy^d	It is over with.
bf	He is gone.
sd	But I do have half of it is a flower bed, just about, all by the porch.
sd	There was some plants that are just Spring bloomers
sd	when the blooms died, the leaves were just horrible looking.
qy	Have you ever seen those?
sd	But the leaves, I do not like them.
sd^e	It is a bulb.
sd	So I just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down. Because I want them to come back up next year.
ny	Yeah.
br	Of hyacinths?
bf	of everything.
qy^d	they will?
sd	And, everybody down here calls these flags. the irises I guess,
sd	I am not sure what they are called.
sd	It has got gr ,
sd	The blooms are, on some of them is yellow, purple, white. Just all different colors.
sd	But when I come down here, everybody told me they are flags.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sv	It is some type of lily.
sd	I have got some in the backyard that bloomed blue. Which I would have liked those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better. And then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color. With little purple spots that it will fade into a solid purple.
sd	And it is a bulb.
b^m	Dutch irises.
b	Uh huh.
no	You know, I really do not know.
sd	they have, they're died down. I am sorry, they are dead now.
sd	They bloom in the Spring.
sd	They bloomed in the Spring.
na	Right about the same time or after.
sd	I took and just mowed over them last year.
sd	and I just threw them on the side, intending to transplant them or throw them away or something. And forgot about them through the whole Winter.
qy	Does that help? .
sd	But they call them flags or down here, down here.
sd	I am not on, I am just getting into gardening this year.
sv	So it was really too late to do much.
b	Oh.
sd	I am wanting bl , I want blue and purple and, you know, just different shades of that. Because my house is gray,
sv	and blue looks so pretty against it.
sd	That will come back up.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I did not know the hyacinths were going to die.
sd	I had bought these, colossians Celosias or whatever.
sd	And they will not grow down here.
sd	Perennial.
sd	Blue.
b^m	Salvia.
sd	I guess, I just went and bought me just about nineteen dollars worth of little buds, planted, already grown.
sd	And it looks pretty good out there.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
br^m	Purple Buddy?
sd	Purple Buddy.
qw	How do you spell that?
bk	Okay.
qy	Do you want to tell me about your budgeting plan?
b	Uh huh.
ba	no.
bf	into savings.
b	Oh.
ba	Well, that's pretty good.
ba	Boy, that's pretty good.
b	Sure.
sd	You have to have the contractor sign with you.
sv	But it's easy to find a contractor for a couple of hundred bucks who'll sign it and let you do it
sd	, where I live, that is.
b	Uh huh.
bf	bad for him,
qy	Is that right?
ba	Wow.
sv	Well, that's kind of handy.
sd	I just finished James Michener's TEXAS book.
sv	Pretty interesting.
sv	Texas has quite the history.
sd	and so we pay ten percent tithing
sd	and then, you know, we put I guess it's like fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account.
sd	But that sometimes we use for emergency type things.
sv	We're fortunate that way, that I make enough to do what we want to do.
ba	Well that's pretty.
ba	That's a great position to be in.
qy	Is that right?
qw	What kind of consulting do you do?
bh	Is that right?
sd	I I'm a E D P auditor.
sd^e	and P C s.
sd	I'm just brushing up on, well, C plus plus.
ny	Uh huh.
qy	Three
b	Oh.
ba	You got a buy.
b	Sure.
bf	Melted, or Just wet
b	Okay.
qh	how many years have we tried to find a cure for cancer.
qo	how about yourself.
sv	they say a million people are infected with the H I V virus,
sv	I think,
sd	in the country, America.
sd	and they have millions.
sd	I've just heard it on the radio.
sv	Sometimes you hear things on the radio that, you know, could be true or couldn't be.
sv	I guess they're spending a billion or so a year on this AIDS research.
qy	Do you think they should spend more?
qw	What do you think, Doug, of Mister Johnson?
qy^d	Magic?
qy	Do you think he's the hero that he's being called by a bunch of the media?
sd	I talked to my kids about it, you know
sd	it's something that I hadn't done before.
sv	or I was glad he did that, for young kids, because a lot of kids would have ended up dying because of what he was promoting.
qy^d	I guess you might not.
qy	Is it pretty nasty?
ba	it sounds awful.
qy	Is it just that the immune system ceases to function properly
b	really.
o	Okay.
qw	what kind of books do you enjoy reading?
sd	and I really enjoyed, you know, all the little things that you find out about Texas.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	so I, frequently purchase and read, books, mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment.
sd	right now I'm occasionally reading on a book about, the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and its history.
sv	That's fairly interesting.
qo	How about you?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	well, maybe I am into some things occasionally that I don't think of in terms of self improvement.
sd	but I don't label it as such.
sd	but, they would be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself. You know getting yourself in gear to, sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do. Convincing you that you need to get on with it.
aa	Yes.
aa	Sure.
b^r	yeah.
sv	That's a little heavy for me.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well I guess I also have been reading, a lot of things on, quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what I'm involved in a lot at work.
sv	but, I think sometimes the word is a little over used
b	Yeah.
sd	Well we just started,
fc	and good bye.
fc	Good bye.
sd	so my favorite team is about the Rangers.
b	Yeah.
qy	You think they'll sign Ruben?
br	No?
sv	I think it's going to have a big effect if they don't on the other, Hispanic players.
sv	I think that's going to be the big problem.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Oh.
sv	I think they just want to stay mediocre and draw their two million fans out there and then be happy with it and not have to pay the bucks to get a contender in here.
aa	yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sv	but they need the pitching.
aa	I know.
sv	it's sure aggravating when you go out and bust your butt working, you know, your day job and you can work your day job the rest of your life and not bring home as much money as they bring home in one game.
sv	It's real aggravating,
aa	That's right.
sv	but you think we'd, someday get an owner in here that could afford to buy the, the players we need.
sv	so it's a lot of losers .
sv	It's about to get, you know as bad as the Cubs or whoever, you know.
b	Right.
o	I'm telling you.
sv	I think this town would go crazy if they ever got even a playoff team.
sv	So, at least that will be exciting when we get that,
sd	and, I mean, I'm getting tired of them going into each year saying, you know, Bobby Witt is the answer and Kevin Brown is the answer,
sv	I mean, it's time to either, you know, put out or shut up.
b	Right.
qo	Well, what's your views on it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Sure.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	a lot of reasons for that, not just because I'm a hard ass or anything.
sv	it helps mature them a little bit, and helps them understand the world, the way it really is.
b	yeah.
b^r	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	and most of them aren't.
sv	Kids in high school are just too young to be married.
sv	They don't how tough it is out there to make a living.
sd	and after traveling around the world a few times, I realized that, things ain't the way they seem.
sd	And I did a lot of growing up there,
sv	and, you know, if you could have a thought of something like a Peace Corps sort of organization. I mean, this would be so useful, for instance, just helping old folks.
sv	and it would be nice to have somebody come over and cut their yard or paint their house, or do minor repairs, or something like that.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and it got to the point where, I mean, me and my brother both were gone, and she couldn't maintain the house, without large expenditures of money.
sv	but it would have been nice if there had been somebody to come around and take care of the little things. You know, like the yard work and little repairs, and painting and stuff like that.
sv	I mean, I mean, the kids who would be giving the service are going to get a lot more out of it than just money.
sv	they're out for themselves
sv	And we can do it a lot more efficiently than the government.
sv	We don't need to add fourteen layers of bureaucracy to a program.
sd	the thing that Carter works on, Habitats For Humanity, I was involved in that in Montgomery, before I came up to North Carolina,
sv	but it's better than nothing.
sv	course, on the other hand, I can start complaining very loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing something for themselves, but just won't. Because it's far more advantageous for them to sit there and just draw, welfare money than it is to work.
sd	And they came out four thousand dollars better a year, by taking welfare.
sv	Far better for them to sit on their butts and draw the money.
sd	and it got shot down.
sd	I mean, if nothing else, go out along an interstate and pick up garbage.
qrr	or do they use prisoners?
sd	that's the way they did it in Alabama, too.
sd	usually you'd see these big chain gangs out there, picking up trash.
fp	How are you doing?
fp^r	I said, how are you doing?
sd	We're trying to retire in our fifties.
o	Good luck on that one, then.
sd	I said good luck on that one, then.
b	Huh uh.
qy^d	You can't say?
b^m	Yeah.
sd	It's like two hundred dollars
sd	I think that would be a ,
^g	What?
sd	but you don't have to do that option if you don't want to.
qy	do you have that?
b^m	No.
sd	It takes it out of your salary before taxes.
b	Okay.
aa	Yeah.
sd	I wonder why.
sd	I said, I wonder why.
o	Cafeteria?
qo	so. Let's see what else can we do?
qw	What?
bf	You mean, like for health insurance?
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, that's easier done in a company than it is in, school teaching.
ba	Thank you .
sd	I said, thank you.
sd	But it's hard to get rid of a teacher if they're not good.
sd	It's almost impossible.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	Right.
sd	You know, you knew you weren't going to lose your job unless you really did something horrendous.
b	Right.
sd	In some places they don't.
qy	Do they?
b	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
qw	What did you get your degree at?
qw	And what's your job now?
sd	I'd like to see flexible hours. And teaching, shared, job sharing, more of that.
sd	and you get to choose your boss.
qy	Well, so you get to evaluate him though?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
qy^g	I'll let you start first, okay?
sd	so that way we could kind of control, in, control it,
sd	and, we live in kind of a small town,
sd	and we're all comfortable in it.
sd	you can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and everybody else.
sd	and that helped.
o@	he did everything else. We've been in it six years.
sd	but he will not build a second one himself. Because he says age wise he'll never be able to handle that again .
aa	yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	but, you know, we could not have one as large as we have if, you know, we hadn't did it ourselves.
sd	but, you know, it's ours.
aa^r	That's right.
sv	apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high .
fc	and it was nice talking to you.
fc	bye bye.
qy	Do you have a budget that you go on?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh
sd	Well, my bills I usually know approximately how much they're going to be.
sd	Each month they are more or less just about the same, you know.
sd	And then, like for groceries and everything, we try to put, like, two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can in the kitchen
sd	and then that's what we use to buy the groceries with.
sd	and usually that's enough.
sd	but I don't have any, you know, small children to have anything extra come up, you know, like, running to the doctor or something like that with them.
sd	In fact, I did have to take my dog to the vet the other day .
qy^g	that, it's worse than having a kid,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	so I just went ahead and took my early pension.
sd	But I only get that once a month.
b	Yeah
sd	So, you know, I really have to try to budget, that I don't go over that amount, you know, each month.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
b	right.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	Right now it's terrible isn't it?
b	Yeah.
sd	last year I didn't.
sd	So this year, now I have them taking out fifty dollars a month out of my checking account for my Christmas club.
sv	So I figure, you know, that's going to help some.
aa	right, you know.
b^r	right.
sd	I'm taking like, sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what I can
sd	so I won't have to go out and buy the ready made clothes anymore.
sv	but I figure that will help me save you know.
sd	because I have three sisters
sd	and none of those are really interested in sewing.
sd	and then I can also, you know, do some crafts and sell those at garage sales.
sd	So, which I've been doing.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
b	Oh.
qy^d	it is?
ba	well, that's nice you know.
b	Uh huh.
sd	they automatically took it out of my out of my payroll.
qw	So, so what have you seen lately that, you think is worthwhile?
sd^e	I saw the previews.
qy	does he, does it have a happy ending,
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	that was funny, wasn't it .
sd	and, and, and the regular NAKED GUN and AIRPORT and, you know.
aa	Yes.
sd	one, absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly, you know, serious subject.
sd	I only rented it, you know, maybe a month ago
qy	but. Have you seen that?
sd	and there might be a word or two changed.
sv	but it's, it's a glorious movie
sd	but there are also these various, David Lynch movies.
sd	That made me go out and watch every David Lynch movie I could lay my hands on.
sd	 well, I don't especially recommend,
qy	did you see TWIN PEAKS?
sv	So, if you weren't drawn to watch that, maybe you wouldn't be drawn to these movies, either.
sv	they're just strange.
sd	and, in the case of TWIN PEAK there's some elements of the supernatural in it, too.
sv	it would have made, you know, these Fellini movies look normal.
na	I do like movies a lot.
qy	do you rent them,
b	Yes.
sd	I mean, she falls asleep .
sd	So we have to pick just the right kind of movie to, to, to appeal.
fc	Take care.
fc	bye.
qw	How do you get your news mostly?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	Well, I can hardly wait for my morning paper to come.
sd	It's really funny because, my sister grabs the sports and I grab the headlines .
sd	so about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too, you know.
sd^e	I just have a channel that has music except for, like every hour, you know, say eight o'clock, nine o'clock, they come on for just a little bit of the news.
qy	can you hold on just for a second?
ad	Just a minute.
fa	I'm sorry to keep you waiting .
sd	and that was a call waiting.
aa	That's true too.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	There is a lot of it that's just garbage, as far as I'm concerned, you know.
sd	But I just like more or less, the, the daily news, you know. Just, especially the weather.
sd	I like that .
sv	Although they're usually wrong .
sd	but that's how long it is.
sd	And, seems like they have the local news and they have the world news.
sd	And then, my morning paper. I can hardly wait for it to come.
aa	huh uh.
sd	But I've always been a morning person to get up, you know.
fc	But anyhow. Well, listen, I guess that's about it then.
fc	It's been nice talking to you Tony.
bh	really?
sv	it might this time.
fc	Okay, Tony.
fc	Bye bye.
qo	I mean, what thoughts do you have on the subject?
qy^d	you did?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I went to an inner city high school in Chicago.
sd	It was a divorce situation of my parents.
sd	And it was a cultural shock to me. in terms of what I went through.
sd	and now it's called Roberto Clemente .
sd	yeah, that's exactly, about twenty years now.
qy	I mean did you find that people appreciated having the privilege of being,
sd	I agree with that,
sd	I didn't mean that in a totally negative sense.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and I would say the majority appreciated what they were having in this country.
sd	And, you know, Chicago, back then, even had bilingual classes.
sd	so if you can imagine how I even go , ,
sv	I mean, and I guess I look at is as an enlightening sense.
sd	I mean, I don't really have enough in terms of an argument, pro or con in terms of making any type of change.
b	Uh huh.
aa	that's exactly.
sd	I've been back up for a reunion.
sd	I mean my husband, grew up in, a majority, WASP, southern Ohio, you know.
qh	And yet, how did I turn out the way I did turn out.
sv	so you know that parts of it are beautiful and parts of it are squalor.
aa	Like here, yeah, it's the same.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	This is true.
sd	I know what you're saying,
"	and emotionally that the people there wanted it.
qy^g	I mean, right now they have the privilege of voting with the United States, don't they.
sd	We traveled a lot to the B V I, the British Virgin Islands.
sd	So you always pass through San Juan in going to places like or .
sv	and it's, I think what they do need is an infusion of some of the United States, privileges, some of our resources. The educational, the teachers, the, academic opportunity, you know,
sv	I don't think we do enough of a resource transfer, if there is such a thing.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	They'll lose their ethnicity as they say,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	I mean to this day are you still in touch with any native Puerto Ricans that you have made friends with,
sv	and the one right after us, their parents did not want to acclimate to the United States. in terms of retaining,
sv	and their background it would be, you know, we , I guess I would say the Latin or Latino heritage.
sv	But on the other hand, I guess it's all about choice in everything.
qy	I mean, were they glad?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I know what you're talking about
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've got to go, because that's my cordless battery going.
fa	I'm sorry .
fc	and, thank you for your time.
fc	bye bye .
o	okay.
sd	this is strange because I pressed one and I thought it said begin.
sd	I'll tell you, what I'm going to have. if I can find it.
sd	I don't know if it will come out.
sd	I won't have a sharp cheddar because for fondue I think it should be a little calmer than real sharp, cheddar.
sd	And then I was going to make other things like potato skins.
sd	And, I was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a vegetable.
sv	it's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party.
sd	instead of something greasy or,
sd	I think they try and suggest it.
sd	You take little toothpicks and cut up, pineapple and strawberry, and even banana if you can do it just before you leave.
sd	It stays nice and fresh.
sd	I like those .
sv	But they look easy enough to make
b	Yeah.
sv	you get this, probably pretty sticky after you get done.
sd	Then you've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because, you know, when you scrape it, it makes the water.
^q	Go buy me some strawberries.
sd	but if you get a sour strawberry,
sd	they're coming up from Florida,
b	Yeah.
sv	actually I think they get, some of them from South America.
sd	Of course, their seasons are switched.
qy	So, do you want to discuss the recipe?
co	I have a recipe if you want .
sd	but I make my own homemade pudding just because I don't like box pudding.
ad	and you put it on a really low heat.
sd	I mean, no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot.
sd	they're called moo goo leaves or something
sv	They're real neat.
sv	but I don't think it gets it good enough.
sd	it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch,
sd	once it starts boiling, I cook it for a good seven minutes, seven to ten minutes
sd	and that makes french vanilla, custard.
sd	A chocolate powder.
sd	It comes in like a real dark can,
sd	our mothers used to use it.
sd	we all used to,
sd	it's not like Nestles Quik.
sv	I suppose you could use that.
ny	Yeah,
^q	this is kind of groedy .
sd	I mean, something she had collected out of WOMAN'S DAY or something.
sv	I think you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or a regular beater
sd	the trick is to get the cornstarch,
sd	once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top.
sd	I'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg.
sd(^q)	he says, I can stick the spoon right in this.
sd	when you cook a package, it's a little less,
sd	so you can put, Saran Wrap over the top.
sd	and I might put it back on.
sd^e	well when it starts steaming a lot, I definitely, yeah, put it in the refrigerator,
sd	my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you're going to make it work too hard.
b	yeah,
sd	so, , that's why I do that.
b	Uh huh.
bd	That's okay.
sd	it's more, concentrated, so they know where you are.
sd	and that's one thing that started in the community.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	and yet, I know that, some of the stores will actually help the community, not pay you the money back, but will pay the, community, like through the schools or things like that.
sd	and I know that we have the can, the can, different can banks around the city that you can go to and do that.
sd	but I know on Monday, the garbage men pick up like just, any limbs or any extra trash that you might have,
sv	And that might be an extra day to put out things that might be recycled if we had a certain colored can to put them in or something in the city to put, like either glass or newspapers or whatever.
b	Yeah.
sd	I know getting a newspaper everyday, I know I could just, you know, do that because I have to pick it up,
sv	and it really could be recycled.
qy^d	Did you?
ad	Tell me.
qy	Don't you have to take like labels off of those jars?
b	Yeah.
sd^m	Take them off,
^2	both liter sodas
qy	can you do that.
bk	Okay.
b^r	right.
sd	and I don't know what it would take to get my children to start working on it.
sv	I have two older ones that probably would go along with if I had it arranged so that it wasn't a big project, you know.
aa	Okay,
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
o*	should begin. / * listen; could probably code if we could tell if it said "we" or "you"
sd	basically I work for Honeywell in Minneapolis
sd	They cover, just about everything, vision, dental, medical
sd	so I'm pretty satisfied myself.
qw	what's your situation?
b	Oh.
qy	Are you a professor there?
bk	okay.
aa	no doubt .
ba	Well, that's good.
sd	and being a government organization you got quite a few holidays off.
sd	You maybe get two or three a year.
sv	unless you have some vacation time or some sick leave or whatever, you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time.
qw	What do you consider most important, you think, in terms of the different benefits?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	they basically reviewed Oregon's plan or The Oregon Plan toward, nationalizing health care and that kind of thing.
sd	They've essentially made up a list of, all the different, medical maladies that you can have and then basically made a cutoff,
sd	if you don't, you're kind of out of luck
sv	I think health care is probably the most pressing the pressing one,
sd	and I know historically a lot of companies I think carried dental as a rider along with the medical
qw	how does, University of New Hampshire handle it?
ba	Great.
qy	is that generally across the board, do you think
b	Uh huh.
bk	okay.
b	Right.
sd	I'm kind of interested because actually, that's the route I'd like to take when I finally get my degree is to teach in a university.
sd	I'm a doctoral student in Florida right now
sd	That's one of the things I'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would cover and things like that.
bh	is that right?
ad	tell me some about your camping experiences, Carolyn.
bk	Okay.
qw	Wh , where do you go camping at around here?
bk	Okay.
qw	what activities do you do when you're camping?
sd	I grew up in South Dakota, up in the Black Hills
sd	It was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river
ad	Go ahead.
b	Okay.
qy	Now are there any mountains or big rocks a person could hike around this area.
bk	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
qy	the one in Tyler, has it been pretty commercialized, I suppose?
bk	Okay.
qy^d	helps keep the pests out, I suppose.
sv	but, you know, it sure beats driving a thousand miles, to find a mountain, I guess.
sd^e	we just moved down in June.
sd	if I can get on Central from anywhere, I'm happy.
b	Okay.
sv	I guess my feelings are that, we almost have a universal health care system, to a great degree, except that now I read where we've left out about thirty four million people.
sv	because it's going to become an obligation of either state, local or federal government, anyway.
sv	Well, it seems to me that I'm paying anyway, because or my insurance carrier, anyway, when I pay something, the bills seem inordinately high.
sv	And the reason that they're inordinately high is because that has, to cover the costs for the indigent people who apparently don't have the money or the wherewithal to do that.
sv	It would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who, employ these people, and pay them, you know, subminimum wages or whatever, were asked to share their fair burden of this too, just as my employer is.
sv	And myself, I guess.
qw	Well well, who else is going to do this, then?
sd	I mean, it's worked successfully in Europe.
sd	I travel extensively and spend, maybe half a year in Europe every year,
sv	and, people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree.
sd	As a matter of fact, if I'm injured or have an emergency when I'm, say in Germany or France, that, I'm automatically taken care of,
sd	I mean I don't even have to pay.
sd	Well I, I know it.
sd	well, my father's not living but my mother is,
sv	I mean, the, absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in,
sv	The young people aren't getting the proper care that they need, and nutrition, I think,
sv	and we're spending on these many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people.
sv	I mean, it does, seem like we're, th , th ,
sd	now I noticed just the other day in the paper that payments will be based not, just on cost, but on cost effectiveness.
sd	we'll see how that goes.
sd	but we'll see what happens.
sd	at least I've blown off steam of the way I feel about it.
qy	Okay?
qw	What was one of the latest ones that you've seen, actually?
sd	I've, become available to come and go more often,
^q	and I can see what I please."
sd	kind of gory and lots of, you know action.
sd	do you know that I don't follow performers,
sd	Some I know,
sd	some I don't.
sd	the guy that played in it, he was not the star, but the one that played in it that I liked best was the one who was in, the one about the old people.
ny	uh huh.
sd	He was a blond haired, heavyset alien in COCOON.
sd	I don't know what his name is.
sd	That was with Richard Dreyfuss.
sv	but it was, a very, it was a poignant humor
sv	The characters played very well off one another.
qw	What are some others that you have seen lately?
sd^2	That's one I can watch, over and over and over again.
sv	There are a number of good movies like that.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	You don't work?
ad	Well, you are going to have to find a mother's day out and have him call in sick one day.
sv	and the price is as reasonable as renting a video.
sd	and I go quite frequently.
sd	now I was WARLOCK too, which is supposed to be the story of a, witch hunt that is, you know, magically shot into the present time.
sd	there was more gore than I was interested in seeing.
sd	But, the action was comfortable
sv	but they were done a little more tastefully.
sv	that's a wonderful, wonderful job by Robin Williams and Peter De Niro.
qw^g	what did I say, Peter?
sd	I said Robert De Niro.
sv	And, he has done a really good job of characterizing the, disabled person.
sv	Even when he's sad, you know, you great faith that he will get happy again.
sd	and they will be videos.
sd	And, I understand that's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television.
sd	I want to go see that.
sd	And I'm going to try to get in DANCES WITH WOLVES.
sd	but it's just that they are both very long movies,
sd	and the matinee starts before I can get away from work.
sd	And, after that I get involved in other things and don't want to don't want to go back.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I cannot remember too much about it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I remember.
h	I don't know
sv	But, he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older.
sv	I think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning, whether he is or not.
sv	It just was not enough to it.
sd	it was called, HARD WAY, where he was an actor, trying to portray trying to portray a policeman.
sd^e	I live in Dallas.
qy	are you in a house?
bk	Okay.
sd	and the carpet was new
sd	It's just a two story building.
sd	On the first floor, where I am, there's a patio.
ny	Yeah.
sd	and, let's see, I have two bedrooms.
sd	but they didn't provide it.
sd	and that's one of the reasons that I did move.
sv	Get tired of dragging clothes to the laundromat .
ad	So, tell me ab ,
b	Yeah.
sv	It just , It's a real good ,
sv	it's a good time to buy, if you're in the market.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	so you want a bigger one.
sd	My parents in New York had, a, three family house.
sd	and then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment, you know.
sd	But, in Dallas I just, I just haven't seen basements in houses.
sd	And I've looked at a lot of them, you know .
aa	No,
sd	I haven't, I have yet to see a basement in a house.
sd	there are some areas though where they have a problem with, the houses kind of sinking a little bit to the,
sd	But you have to know the right spot, to pick where that doesn't happen.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	I see.
qy	Where did you say you're at, Colorado?
sd	That's right .
qy^d	Anywhere near, Virginia Beach?
sd	because down in east Texas there's a lot of red clay.
sd	And, in the Dallas, you know, Fort Worth city areas you don't see that.
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	I see.
b	Uh huh.
qy	So, is your house in an area by itself?
qy^d	it's not connected to another one?
qy^g	But they're not connected are they?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
fp	Hi Pat.
b	Uh huh.
sv	our families have changed.
sv	Society has changed.
sv	Everything has changed.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sv	well even raising boys today is different though, because, they are expected to do so much more than they used to.
sv	It's, some good, some bad,
sd	I have chosen to stay at home, and raise my children.
sd	And I have a ten year old and a twelve year old.
sd	And I was a single parent for awhile and worked.
sd	and you know, that was wonderful.
sd	But I thank God everyday now that I have that choice. And that I am able to do things at home
sd	and I volunteer a whole lot.
sd	And, that's my job right now.
sd	And I love it.
sd	I really love it.
aa^r	right.
sd	and that will come.
sd	I know that day will come,
sd	and I am looking forward to that too.
sd	But that's a different phase in my life,
sd	and I am glad that I am able to do what I want to do right now.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Right.
bf	You are not beating rugs,
bf	you are not, right, doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I mean, you know, men are sitting behind desks a whole lot more, than they used to.
b^r	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	right.
b^r	Right.
bf	And stress disorders and things like that.
b^m	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	yeah.
b^r	uh huh.
b^r	right.
sv	You know, it's funny,
sd	I was rea , I was really looking forward to summer, thinking we are going to have some time off.
sd	And actually, today is really as far as I am concerned, the first day of summer . Because we have had so much going on the past few weeks.
aa	And, you are right,
sv	well that's how society has changed, you know,
sv	you know, we find ourselves doing things that, we never did as kids.
sd	You know, I do not remember, being involved in things like this.
sv	it's different,
sv	only time will tell whether it's better or worse, than the way we grew up.
sv	But, it's just very different.
aa^r	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Right.
qh	But is not that difficult to do when you are working full time and have to come home and prepare a meal and, get homework done,
qh	and, you know, where do you find the time.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^g	And then that way, we have not changed in, hundreds of years, have we.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
bf	Didn't he though .
aa	That's very true.
^q	I am having a problem with, you know, another member of the family,
^q	I will not.
^q	You know, you work it out for yourself.
sd(^q)	And it's amazing, she said, you know,
^q	and they suck me into these arguments and, these conversations
sd(^q)	And she said I am not doing it anymore.
b	uh huh.
b^r	yeah.
qw	who do you like? .
sd	that's the same with me.
qw	and who's the other big guy?
sv	And Kenny Rogers, he's kind of country verge, you know on the verge of country western.
ba	wonderful.
sd	and so, you know, I'm, hear the rock music, not the hard rock, but the, you know, Michael Bolton type stuff.
sd	He's my personal favorite.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	But I've got teenagers,
sd	that's probably my all time favorite.
b	Right.
qw	What do you teach, what grade?
qw^d	A certain subject?
sd	my husband and I are taking a computer class at our junior college .
sv	so it's very interesting.
sd	the subject of music .
sd	I play the, volunteer to play the piano at the children's Christmas program for the whole grade school, which is K through six five hundred kids.
sd	and my little girl will start French horn next year,
sd	and so I'm pushing that on my daughter because I want to play in our city band, not the symphony, with just the city band once we get the, the French horn
sd	Right now I'm busy chasing my kids.
sv	and the kids just love him.
sv	It is wonderful.
qy	do you .
b	Uh huh.
qy	have you ever served as a juror?
sd	I never have either.
sv	But I think they've got a lot of problems.
aa	True.
aa	I think that's true.
qy	would you prefer all trials by a judge?
sv	I think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking well it's only going to cost the insurance company,
sv	when it comes to sentencing phase, I guess they tell them if the person has a previous record and stuff.
sd	and the judge decides whether or not they should hear it.
qy	Do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
bf	I mean, some of them said one way and some the other.
sv	I think it does have to be unanimous.
sd	or else it was a hung jury.
sv	I think maybe, majority might be sufficient.
h	It's hard to say though.
^h	Oh.
sd	I hadn't thought about international trials at all.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah,
sv	I think maybe they'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street for something like that because of the cultural differences. Things like that.
o@	What about uniform sentencing? Right.
sd	It's not a discretionary thing.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I wish that when they sentence someone, if they're going to sentence him to five years, then make him serve five years.
b	Yeah,
sv	and sometimes those people are young enough, they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble.
sv	I don't believe that very often happens.
sv	In fact, I think they end up worse, because the conditions are so bad.
aa	Yeah.
sv	I think maybe they ought to just be punished with some kind of real punishment, like hard labor for a shorter length of time, you know.
sv	Actually make them do something that's not pleasant and do it and get it over with and get back in the, you know, world and not spend so much time sitting around, letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them,
b	Yeah.
sd	Something besides license plates and tiddlywinks.
b	Yeah.
fc	Well, I think that covers it.
fc	Nice talking to you.
fc	Bye.
fc	You, too.
sd	I get things ready and then I enjoy.
sd	and I have fun .
sd	That's when we camped the most.
sd	and getting out into nature and relaxing, and having the family do a good share of the work, you know,
sd	and the part that I did was more fun than labor because they did the running and toting chores and I just helped cook and kind of organize, you know.
qy	Have you done, the big pot cooking?
sd^m	Big frying p ,
sd	and, I mean, you know, he did it up really good .
sd	And so, after he took that merit badge, he did all the shopping and getting ready for it.
sd	like I would take corn bread and, cook a pan inside of a pan over a camp, stove.
sd	It's like an oven.
ad	Just put a thing on it.
qw	What did you like to do most?
qy^g	That's neat isn't it?
sd	I agree.
qr	Well now in Florida, is there ti , are there times of the year when it's very comfortable to camp or is it always kind of hot.
b	Uh huh.
^g	right.
sd	we have not camped a great deal here because, a good share of the time in the Summer time, it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping.
sd	when the kids were little we were in New Jersey, and in, Allendale and, Waldwick,
sd	and it was so, you know, pick your own, blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast .
ad	go ahead.
qw	Where did you live?
sv	But that is a particularly neat area for camping because,
sd	you don't have to go very far.
sd	and we had, little clipper sail boat.
sd	And so we would sail and, did a lot of camping that way.
sv	and it's fun, too, I think.
bh	Do you?
qy^d	so you kind of, an everyday camper .
bf	A full time camper.
qy	Well now, are you living alone now,
bf	You and your dog, .
sv	but, I still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family, and enjoy nature and, kind of wipe out the stress of everyday life.
ad	Tell me your name again.
b^m	Jack,
bk	all right.
sd	we're in Plano,
sd	but we've been here about, eighteen years.
sd	Well we're all, lots of people from T I up this way.
fc	good to talk to you.
fc	bye bye.
sd	On the other hand, they really decided themselves.
qo	what kind of experience did you have?
b	Uh huh.
sv	but I think it makes a big difference in terms of finding a school that is sort of right for the child in terms of his or her happiness and, and, and the appropriate support environment and things like that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qrr	or did you just sort of say listen to your guidance counselors
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think that's a great idea,
sv	it seemed expensive at the time you're doing it, but the compared to the total decision it's nothing.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	I mean, I found that my kids had no conception what college was really like and that the process of going around to a few schools with them really helped them understand
sd	and being able to go with them to at least some of them gave me a chance to explain things to them in reference to what we had seen.
ba	Good grief .
qw	What is twenty one thousand?
qw	What school is that?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Helps to at least set up range of things to look at.
qrr	or do you have some,
b	Uh huh.
sd	it's more just a pretty, a fairly, accurate, recording of what I spend, and what I think I am going to have to spend.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah.
sv	That sounds real similar.
b	yeah.
b	Sure.
sv	and it's real fun to just see how things have changed over the years.
ba	My goodness.
b	Yes.
sd	And she came upon a budget book that she had back in the thirties. when they,
sv	I mean it was, it was just almost laughable in some instances that, you know,
sd	of course, it's all relative, of course,
sd	for a pair of shoes was like five dollars
b	Oh.
ba	isn't that, something.
aa	that is really something.
aa	That's true.
sd	that's just good old economics working.
sd	And, our son could care less about a budget,
sd	I mean, she has everything planned so closely, that if, something goes wrong, it just throws her for a loop .
aa	yes.
aa	Yes.
b	Yeah.
sd	and, I think that is probably what happened in our house
sd	and, that really paid off.
sd	Because when time came for him to go back to graduate school, we were in fairly good shape financially as far as not having any major debts.
b	Yeah.
sd	he is, an electrical engineer. And, in fact, went through, many years of graduate school and got his P H D
sd	so we, had a lot of years of budgeting .
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, I'm working, I'm working on my masters degree now,
sd	so we have had, once again, you know, a real lean year for us.
b	Yeah.
sd	you know exactly what it, what it's like then.
sd	I guess you figure that that is an investment that is, really invaluable.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	And I, think that that's the way that we looked at it in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school that there was a light at the end of that tunnel. You know, that it was worth it to save and to not have, something and, in return know that something better was going to be at the end of it
sv	so it really makes it easier
sd	I am interested in that.
b	Oh.
sd	we were in England and, went to Ireland and Scotland and just rented cars and, did it on our own
qy	Is your business in Dallas then?
bk	Okay.
qy^d	you are kidding.
sd	Well, I'm going to be teaching at Brookhaven in the fall .
sd	and I'm,
sd	And, I will be, in the communications department teaching, English One Oh One to,
sd	I have a couple of sections.
sd	that's the guy who hired me,
ba	Fantastic.
fc	Well, it's been a good type conversation.
qo	or what do you think?
bk	Uh huh.
sv	I think so.
qrr	or have you,
b	yes,
qy	well, have there been significant changes, do you think in the employment place, especially, say at T I.
qy	has anything in particular changed that you have noticed? During your time there.
qw	what kind of work do you do?
bk	Uh huh.
aa	Right.
aa^r	yes.
sd	because, it used to be they were draftsman .
b	Right.
sd	I graduated from college with my bachelor's degree in nineteen sixty four.
sd	And I was a math major, which was a real rarity, among women at that time.
sd	So, I was in a lot of classes where, I was either the only girl or, you know, one of just a very, few women in the class.
sd	I became a technical writer.
sd	But, even so, there were very, very few women in technical writing.
sv	But, that has changed a lot.
sv	In recent years it has just really changed a lot.
sv	but I think they have got a long way to go .
sd	There was something on T V the other day that said that fewer than one or two percent of the chairmen of the board, chair persons, if you will, of the board are women in this country.
sv	And I thought that, you know, that's a pretty significantly small number.
sv	So, there are some strides to be made there.
sv	I think we have come a long way, actually, when I think about, you know, when things were like even, you know, just when I was in high school, and how it is now for girls.
sd	And, I guess I, the one, my one bad thing is that I wish my mother had had some of those opportunities, because, I think she rea , would have succeeded in a lot of ways, that women were not able to succeed, in her, generation.
qy	So, anyway. Do you have children?
sv	That's always a good question.
sd^e	In fact, I have a daughter a, who just graduated in civil engineering, from college.
sd	So, she is pretty much, although there were some other women in her class, she was, you know, one of the minorities, females in the class.
sd	So, she definitely entering into, a male profession.
sd	But, But, you know, for instance there is the organization the Society of Women Engineers,
sv	so, that is recognized, as, you know, a place where women should be.
sv	you see it also in, like in church, where more and more women are becoming ministers. you know, in protestant congregations
qy^d	I do not know if you are Roman Catholic or, you know, what you know about that.
sv	but, that is one area that I can see might change, but I really doubt will change .
sd	I know something.
ad	what do you think, tell me what you think about this.
sd	the, the role of women in combat roles during the war?
sd	Because, I know that now there, they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles.
sd	And, I spoke because women were flying missions you know, for whatever reason, into, in the Persian Gulf war.
sd	I was listening to some of the comments on television the other day, about it,
sd	I do not know if he was a general or, you know, what his rank was, very high.
sv	But, that does not sit very well with a lot of folks, I am sure .
sv	You know, well Neil as far as I am concerned, and I could be wrong about this, the only one area where a woman could not do it is if she just physically did not have the strength, to do something.
sd	because, I think, you know, mentally, and emotionally, I think women can handle a job and, every bit as well.
b	Sure.
sd	but I am sure that there are women who would relish that, you know, kind of job.
sd	So, I guess that should be taken into consideration, as well.
sd	having a daughter who has gone into engineering, I sort of watched progress to see if she did anything differently than I did .
sd	She's a lot more forthright about her opinions and, a little more assertive, than I think I was .
sv	So, that's progress, I guess . have you talked with a lot of people in this project
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Right,
ba	well, that's great,
ba	that's good.
b	Yeah.
ba	well, that's good,
sd	because, I, I guess I placed all but one or two of my calls. And, only because I going to make some money,
sd	see our choir is doing this as a money raising project.
sd	we got the connection through a T I, church member.
sd	And, so we are doing it to raise money for, a large project at church,
sd	and, so I feel like this is one way I can contribute that's not too painful . Financially painful, anyway.
sd	so, I thought, well I will just get on the stick and do it.
fc	Well, I will say good bye to you,
fc	but I have enjoyed the conversation.
ft	Thank you.
fc	Bye bye.
sd	I guess, this is a topic near and dear to my heart, since I am a healthy eater,
sd	and I like a good Italian restaurant or a good,
sd	especially like good prime rib
sv	and there are a lot of good restaurants around here.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Really.
sd	there's a there's a place, half a mile from me here that, has, fantastic prime rib for, eleven dollars for a whole meal, you know a potato and salad and soup, and the whole nine yards,
b	Right.
sd	so, I'll have to go there when I get to get to Dallas.
b	sure.
b	Uh huh.
sd	but I do like, like like a raw, raw bar like oysters and things like that,
sd	I'm an officer in the Air Force and travel quite a bit on business
sd	so I, find myself down in Melbourne, Florida about once a month, once every two months or so and, go and hit the oyster bars down there quite a bit
sd	but, I love that,
sd	you get the crabs
sd	it's like, I can't go anywhere where I where I don't enjoy myself,
aa	That's true.
sv	well, it's really strange that, that seafood is so expensive, because in reality, I, say that, the oceans have the greatest resource of food on the planet,
sd	and yet, we as human beings, haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically
sd	so, we managed to, figure out how to get at just about everything else, but, but not seafood.
sd	and around here the big spicy thing is like, buffalo wings
sv	and those are really hot and the hotter the better,
b	Sure.
b	Yeah.
sd	well, there isn't too much in the way of restaurants that I don't like.
sd	it's so hot.
sd	well, but that stuff goes one notch beyond, my tolerances,
sv	So. Although I guess on this topic are to talk about the, service in a restaurant is always nice though, too
sd	that's one thing,
qw	where have you all been on vacation recently?
br	Detroit?
qy	Is that a nice vacation spot?
bk	okay.
qy^d	So you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot?
ba	that would be nice.
qy	Did you scuba dive there?
ba	that would be nice.
sd	usually when we go, we go to Colorado, to Estes Park area. Which is up kind of near Denver. And, stay in the mountains up there, do a little hiking and resting, get away from the Texas heat, that kind of thing.
sd	so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the, whole summer long .
sd	So that's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation.
b	Oh.
sd	We, we canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River.
sd	but we were pretty convinced he was a full, hermit who lived up in, the woods, that he'd come in his little log boat down the river,
sv	and, That's a good family place to go,
sv	but it wasn't, you know, too easy either.
sv	It was like,
aa	That's true.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sd	the only other place I've ever vacationed, we'd, you know, go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that.
sd	And then I went to England a few years ago.
sd	I was a, student there and spent, a semester studying abroad in London.
sd	I'm probably going back there to work, for a year.
sd	I would spend all my time in London, or most of my time,
sd	because I don't get much into you know, really urban areas a lot
sd	but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone.
sd	You could just kind of , kind of walk around and observe,
sd	I did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people.
sv	It was really interesting.
ba	I know,
sd	I haven't been to Mexico or Canada or,
b	Oh.
sd	I had a friend from there.
sd	but I'd have to have a tour guide with me to help with all the language and all that.
sd	most the places we went to Germany and Switzerland and,
sd	We . We did, we whirlwinded through, Europe.
sd	and you slept on the train at night.
sd	and everyone in Switzerland, knew English.
sd	and we were just , finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things.
sd	That was easy to say .
sd	Tried to get fondue and white wine,
sd	so we , elicited their aid for a while
sd	and, they were very helpful
sd	so, it was a pleasant time.
sv	There's not enough time to go see everything, and then to afford to see everything.
b	Right.
sv	That and sleeping late .
sd	I keep hoping for.
fc	Well
fc	And have a good afternoon.
fc	Okay.
fc	Good bye.
sd	We're talking about capital punishment.
qo	How do you feel about that Lenore ?
sd	I am too, one hundred percent.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	There's just no deterrent.
sv	so, you know, unless they really make it rough on them going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent I don't think.
sv	Man our, prisons are so crowded that, they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set free within a year to two.
sd	Well, that's what ours did, same thing.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	It's not here either really.
sv	You know if they've been convicted and given an appeal and they're still convicted of a crime that's deserving of a lethal injection, let's do it and not waste so many years to do it.
aa	That's right.
b^r	Uh huh.
bf	it works and then again it takes too long for it to work.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
aa^r	Yeah,
sv	and I don't see why it couldn't be shortened considerably.
sv	and, that's why it's filled the prisons up so much I think.
sv	it doesn't.
sd	With all these lawsuits and people suing people over ridiculous things
sd	always will be.
sv	it's it's supported with facts though.
sv^r	It could very easily be supported with facts.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
nn	huh uh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	We'll probably never know how much it actually cost.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	that's true.
aa	Yes
sd	I don't, I really don't know what we need to do about that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
h	I don't know if that will ever happen or not.
sv	which is very difficult to do.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Obviously, he's not going to turn himself in.
b	Uh huh.
aa	True,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	obviously human life means nothing to him.
bf	Past a point it doesn't make any difference.
sv	It really is.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Seems like the prices never go down to where they were originally, though, before the increase started.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	True.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	About the lowest I've seen gasoline in the Dallas area is, I guess, about ninety two point nine now.
sd	Ninety two.
b	really.
sd	That's the lowest I've seen.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I think Mobil was doing very well, too.
sd	Well I assume all the major brands are.
b	Uh huh.
sv	that's true.
b	Uh huh.
h	something like,
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm not sure either.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	that's true.
b	yeah.
bf	dead's dead.
aa	That's true,
sv	but it's interesting.
fc	take care.
sd^t	We're supposed to talk about the Middle East Crisis, and should we be involved and, uh, what's it going to cost us in the long run.
qy	Are you ready?
qy	The Middle East Crisis should we be there?
qy^d	Well, you realize why we were in the Middle East. Why we invaded Iraq, why we were in Saudi, why we attacked Kuwait and why we are still fighting Iraq.
sv	I think it has something to do with oil, don't get me wrong.
sv	But Saddam is a madman.
sv	Anyone that would use chemical weapons to fight his own people,
sv	And, obviously, that has something to do with it.
sd	I can see that he was in Kuwait
sd	Kuwait was the nonaggressor
sd	We have several treaties and several alliances with the Saudis that range back for probably forty years.
sd	You know they've been our through thick and thin.
sd	They, were at the Saudi border. And ready to storm into Saudi.
qy	Shouldn't we try and help our friends?
qh	What did we lose, forty one Americans, lives.
sv	of course, our government is full of liars, thieves, and crooks.
sv	And that's, our own fault because we elected them.
sd	I went on jury duty here not long back.
sd	And one of the guys that was on the jury they were asking him if you could believe a lawyer or if a, lawyer's reputation was so tainted that he couldn't be believed
sd	and one guy being selected snickered and couldn't keep his head up, you know,
sd	He said that when he graduated, the day after his bar examine there in Houston.
^q	His lips are moving.
sv	And ninety percent of all politicians, and lawyers,
sv	The fact that they take our money and don't do what we think is right makes them thieves.
qy	Are we going to lose more lives there?
sd	Well, we hit them with more in one month than we used in the last three years of Vietnam.
sv	And whenever you strike on open terrain with that sheer volume there's nothing they can do about it.
sd(^q)	You know it's not like we threw eight aircraft over there all by ourselves and said this is wrong.
sd	the Brits were there.
sd	This is with U N backing
sd	and to some level even Russia was behind.
sv	So honestly if there was a well perceived war, world wide this was it.
sd	But what I can't understand is then many of the Kuwaiti youth wouldn't fight.
sv	It's okay for us to go extend our youth's lives like so much water in the desert.
sv	And it's not their job to fight for their own land.
sv	And really from all indications the Iraqi beliefs, if you will, are more similar to our own.
sv	They won't work.
sd	it was on the news last night.
sd	The, U S Army is doing it all.
sd	Well, they talked to one Kuwaiti woman yesterday.
sd	And her biggest concern in life was that she couldn't get a housekeeper.
qy	And, do you have a housekeeper?
sd	Well, I wouldn't mind having one.
sd	But, you know, I'd like to make sure that I have a job tomorrow first.
qy^d	you realize that the Kuwaiti government gives every Kuwaiti man, woman, and child money.
sd	For nothing.
sd	For sitting on there kiesters.
sd	And I love it.
sv	but I probably, can never afford it
b	Uh huh.
sd	and we have a doctor at this hospital that has a beautiful new red Ferrari.
sd	but I can't even do that because of the alarm.
sd	So, I just look at it a lot .
sv	But it sure is a pretty thing .
sd	and I thought that I'd continue, to live in my house
sv	And I thought well a tent wouldn't be bad but probably not practical.
b	right .
qy^g	they're pretty aren't they lately .
b	Really.
^q	How about a Greyhound bus .
b	Yeah.
sv	It's not like driving a little sports car.
sd	I didn't know how anything worked.
sd	and so, I figured there was nowhere I was to late to go that I didn't have twenty more seconds.
sd	You release it right at the top,
sd	so you don't have to get out or anything.
sd	I thought I would drown in the seconds that it took me to pull over .
sd	But it all dried out, you know. Didn't take long when the sun came out
ny^r	yeah.
qw	Well, how many credit cards do you have?
qy	do you know any people that run up big bills?
qy	Well, were you able to get one while you're in college?
qo	what do you think about the idea of providing one for somebody like that?
sd	since it's in, mo , the parent gets it for them, that really the parent becomes the one that's responsible,
bf	it's whether the parent wants to take the risk.
sv	and, the thing is, there some advantages, if he got off some place and stranded.
sd	I'm, I'm leaning towards doing it for conven , a convenience,
sd	well, it was a combination of things he had,
qy^d@	but, I guess what's interesting, have you seen the, the, the ads where they're offering to extend payments from, things like the credit union's offering, /* should be more than 1 slash unit
aa	yeah.
sv	The interesting thing about that is that, that they're encouraging you to incur more debt,
sd	And they make more money if you extend your loan.
ny	Yes.
sv	they're not going to keep on if the car were older.
sv	I thinks it's, I think it's poor, economics to carry all that consumer debt at least from a tax standpoint,
sd	and this year it's ten percent or so.
sv	it's interesting that, they encourage us to do things,
o	yes.
sd	if you had a thousand dollars, that means there's another hundred dollar deduction I've given you.
ad	and then you take ten percent of it,
b	okay,
sv	it's not in your best interest to borrow money from a tax standpoint.
qy^d	Sounds like you're very financially responsible.
sd	Well, he's had two kids in college and this kind of thing,
sd	but I agree with you
sd	Well, I did buy a new house last summer.
sd	I bought a second hand car when I was, the middle of my senior year.
^2	Miscellaneous things like food and other things,
sv	and, it's, it's amazing what you learn.
qy	Well, anything else good to say about credit cards?
sd	it's hard to cash a check if you're out of state,
b	Yeah.
sd	they don't do tha ,
b	Yeah.
bf	Carry all that cash with you.
qy	have you seen the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you,
sv	and I think that's where,
sv	the costability of the cash flow is a big issue for them.
fc	Well, it's good talking to you.
fc	Good night.
qy	Do you have any?
b	Uh huh.
b	All right.
b	Yeah.
h	I don't think.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm a doctoral student right now
sd	and, it's a Spanish Pointer named Domino. Kind of looks like a Dalmatian
sd	and whenever anybody comes over, we all have to show him Domino you know .
sd	I j , I actually live in Florida
sd	Domino's a real good dog.
qw	what, possessed you to get the dog?
b	Yeah.
bf	Sure learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it and things like that.
sv	That kind of builds some character a little bit.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	that's something that's important for sure.
qy	I think, do you live in a, in a fairly rural part of the,
bk	I see.
b	Yeah
sd	I would estimate seventy pounds.
sd	it's a suburb of Orlando
sv	but, you know, that whole space issue, I think, is real important.
b	Yeah,
sv	and that's all part of keeping your part of the relationship. You know, showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those issues.
sd	My mother, she freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs, that don't train them
sd	The question was, what is your opinion of youth, spending a year or two in public service.
b	Yeah.
sd	my only experience with it, I was in Central America for a while, and, in San Salvador, in El Salvador,
sd	For instance, everybody had what they called there social year, that they had to put in
sd	and basically it was a, repayment for, high school education,
sv	I think possibly what, they're thinking about here, more external Peace Corps, Type things where we're sending people off shore.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I, guess I was of age when the Peace Corps came in, and all that.
qy	Did you ever get any information on it like,
sd	That's what I was wondering about was whether they actually,
b	Yeah.
qy	Wasn't Jimmy Carter's mama that was in the Peace Corps?
sv	I don't know which end though.
sv	that's been interesting, though, the kids that have been over, you know, coming back right now, you know.
sv	because from what I understand, from some of the guys I know, you know, crime, is punishable, just almost, instantly and public,
sv	so you don't have just a whole lot of, what we consider street crimes.
sv	but when you do that then it becomes almost, a ,
sv	people will kind of set up their own little club,
b	Yeah.
qh	well, if they went AWOL, what are you going to do.
ad	Put them in jail .
aa	right.
sd	he was in C C C during,
sd	and the only good thing he could ever say about, the whole Roosevelt administration was, civilian conservation corps,
sd	He thought that was great.
sd	but that was great.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Yeah
qw	who, who, who would determine what these people do.
sd	You know like C C C was run by the army
sv	and the only opposition to it really was that it was, you know, starting some sort of a military elitist type, you know, special corps of cadre of people and that sort of thing.
sv	And, when the politics get real confusing,
b	Yeah.
sv	We've gotten to the point where, you know, if, well, if the racial make up of the group was such and such, you know, they'd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and, you know, That kind of thing.
ny	yeah.
sv(^q)	and know matter where you build it, somebody else is going to scream, well, you didn't build one over here.
sv	It's, the logistics of the thing that, gets you going.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
sv	here you are to the logistics of the thing again, you know.
sv	it's just so many
sd	My daughter in law is Panamanian, you know,
sd	and they have situations like that down there. Where they have, the social, in some sort of way,
sd	if you want to go to school outside the country, and many Salvadorians did, they'd go to school in Cornell, Iowa, of all places,
sd	the ones I knew, you know, always chose the Red Cross, because they didn't do anything
sv	And they had all kinds of, things they could go into, agricultural, and you know, Really good stuff,
sd	but, unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that, Red Cross, it was so many of them in it, that your chance of having to do something it was very slim.
b^r	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	Then that's, kind of a private organization,
sv	he was a good you know, in , instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible,
sd	so, You know, things he would do with an airplane,
sd	but any rate that's off the subject,
b	Huh uh.
sd	I see how they were organized in, Central and South America
b	Oh.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	you ready?
bk	Okay.
sd	And when we retire we're going to buy us, you know, a new one and get rid of the two that we have right now.
qo	how do you like that ?
ny	yeah.
sv(^q)	But I keep saying lets put it off, lets put it off, because I'm hoping they'll get so many better features.
sd	Because I've seen some of you know, like the head on collision type things, when they had it , and people walk away from it.
sd	and the people walked away from the, wreck, with no scratches nothing. You know, a few bruises.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	I would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door.
qy	would you ever have thought of that?
sv	you probably wouldn't have,
qy^d	I don't know if you've heard about it a few years ago, they said, you know, before they had like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist?
sd	and it was on one of those kind of shows like TWENTY TWENTY
sd	and so it like, you know, did something to their spinal cord
sd	then they were like paraplegics.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you like it?
b	Uh huh.
sd	The reason that we're thinking about something like that, we took a trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to Florida
sd	Well, as soon as I get my quarters in, I'm, retiring period,
sd	that's it,
sd	you know, no more .
sv	but you know, I like to I mean, hear about more people that have things like that you know?
sd	the different kinds
sd	because I've only ridden in the one,
sv	I can't even think of the name of it now.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
t3	you remember?
sd	it has the front and the back and you know, it has the back seat let down into I mean a queen size bed
sd	and then it had the two swivels in the middle, and then the two swivel chairs on the front
sv	and, I mean it was fantastic,
sd	and I was scared to drive that big van.
sv	Well, does yours have that this one had it where you know, you would see something coming in the rear view mirror, I mean not the rear, those little side mirror things
sv	and it would look like it was further back than it was.
qy	does yours do that too?
qy^d	I was wondering if all vans did that,
b	Uh huh.
sd	at first we were going to get a pick up truck, with a camper on the back of it, of it,
sv	I mean it's, unreal,
sv	it just practically don't get any.
sd(^q)	but I said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along when we went somewhere.
sd	if it had, the seat belts on the door now I wouldn't get it.
sd	Period.
sv	that would be good.
sv	I don't think they should do away with the seat belts now.
sv	but I think you need the shoulder thing
sv	but, I think you need that bag to pop out too.
sd	You know, because I know so many people, here that have been killed in head on collisions, where maybe if they had that air bag, they may still be walking around.
sv	Every new car that came out, I wish they would require it in it.
ny	Yeah.
sv	They're given like, a ten year time limit where,
sv	These cars, I guess they figure all the old cars, will be off the roads or something in ten years
sv	and then, you know, if you didn't have a car that had one, then your insurance would go up enormously,
bd	that's okay,
aa	Okay.
fc	Well, you too.
sd^e	I sure do.
sd	I ride a bicycle quite a bit and work out with free weights .
sd	But, I haven't been doing so well this year,
ba	that's weird .
b	yeah.
qw	So what's your motivation?
ny	Yeah.
qr	Was it for health, or, to look good?
bf	It was just a side benefit.
b	Yeah.
aap	Up to a point.
b^m	Yeah.
qrr	or do you enjoy working out.
sd	and, and I feel like I'm obligated to do it, because I've been doing it
sd	so I should keep up.
sd	And there's some days like it's the hardest thing in the world to get started.
sd	I'm, twenty seven.
sd	still young, getting older.
b	Yeah,
b	Yeah.
na	Right.
b	Right.
sd	I notice if you stay in shape you don't age as bad,
sv	those kind of things age you more.
b	Right,
sd	and then you don't work out because you,
aa	Right,
sd	I finally quit because, like all I was doing was going down hill fast.
b	Yeah.
bf^m	Right back to them.
b^m	Yeah.
b^r	yeah.
sd	and now I work out at home, because my schedule with school and work, I don't have time to get down to one.
sd	but, I actually prefer to work out alone.
bh	Really.
b	Yeah.
sd	but when you get into some of health clubs where you just stand around and wait.
sd	You know, I like to start, get it done and get out of there.
sd^e	I'm not.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sv	especially having a kid, I guess, tends to just gain weight because you have to, to, to,
bf	Just have to start all over.
b	Right.
sv	some people are a little bit fanatical about it.
sd^e	and about, working out and fitness, you know,
sv	but people that live for it and, you know, eat a bunch of different pills, and, all that kind of stuff, it gets a little bit obsessive.
b^r	Yeah.
sd	Steroids.
sv	there's really bad for you.
b^m	hormones.
sv	it's too dangerous.
sd	and he just, really looked bad.
h	And he, I don't know, just,
sv	At least you got a chance to out run them that way.
sd	and it, I like to move a little faster and cover more ground.
sv	I would think it would be hard on your legs and your joints and stuff.
b	Yeah.
sd	I can't.
b	Yeah.
sv	it's dangerous.
sd	but a regular ten speed with those skinny tires, you slide all over the place.
b	Yeah.
fc	Well good luck with the new kid.
fc	All right.
sd	Wendy, I guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if that may be the case and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that,
qy	do you have or a monthly budget, or a long term budget that you stick to?
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
sd	and we have to, pretty much stick to a budget.
sd	but, We have a fixed income
sd	and, what we try and do to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have, you know, the house payment,
sd	and we also try and set aside money for savings, set aside money for the coll , the kids' education college education, the future and, set aside money for bonds
sd	because we've been married for about ten years
sd	and we find out that, you know, no matter what kind of budget you stick on, there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house, that you have to have money for and, not enough to go and to take a loan out, but, you have to have money for.
sd	it's helped us, so that we haven't been, you know, too long on the month and too short on the money and try and stick with that
sd	and we stick to it
sd	and there's no surprises in that .
sd	Well, actually I have four kids.
sd	I have four four little boys,
ba	You bet.
ba	You bet.
b	All right .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ba^r	good.
b	Uh huh.
qw	well, what year are you in in college?
qy^d	so you have a few more years.
qy^d	I imagine it, is a little difficult to stick with a budget during that, during school and so it forth.
b	Yes .
bf	And sometimes that's a little hard with books and music and sheet music and stuff you've got to work on, too.
qy	Well, you're not a starving artist, yet, are you?
ba	Good.
ba	Well, good.
qy^g	there's enough of those in the world,
sd	I'm glad to hear that, Wendy.
br	who's not very well educated?
aa^r	yes.
sd	So that's why I'm planning and preparing for the, education of my children, also try and set that money aside.
sd	I majored in business administration.
ad	Tell me what books you read.
sd	I try to avoid the,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That does cut into your, reading time a lot.
b	Yeah.
sd	So, you know, I will, encourage you that you do get a little more time to yourself later on .
sd	I, won't say what.
b	Yeah.
sd	 I'm an editor.
sd	And s , so, I'm at the
sd	and therefore, I read, psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, philosophy, linguistics, history, 
sv	I've read some of it.
sv	It's, it's a great place to be
sd	If they don't, want an editor, they don't come .
sd	We, don't.
sd	 we have books that are written here that are then published by all sorts of different, commercial and academic publishers and university presses.
sd	So, I end up sometimes reading the things that are written here all the way through, sometimes just a few chapters because that's as far as they get .
sd	But, I also get, of course, lots of references to neat stuff to read about.
sd	So, I was just thinking when they told me the topic, I should read the, titles of the five books that are sitting on my desk right now that I'm in the middle of.
sd@	And, I'm reading, WITHIN THE PLANTATION HOUSEHOLD, which is a history, sort of a sociological history of southern women, black and white living on plantations. * needs slash unit a book called POISONS OF THE PAST, which is about ergotisms, that, fungus that grows on rye
sd	it causes the, , Saint Anthony's Fire Disease, where, people fell into fits
sd	and, There is a theory, at least, that a lot of people who were accused of witchcraft were actually under the influence of erga.
sd	like nursing, started out all men and then in the nineteenth century, began to have women.
sd	And now it's practically all women.
sd	And the, thing that changed that was the manual typewriter.
sv	It , then it became, you see, just sort of a clerical task.
sd	When you wrote it out in long hand you were a,
sd	You were a confidential assistant to the, person.
sd	And then, I've got a book called FASHIONS IN SCIENCE, which is a sociology that explains, why certain theories get to be popular in, sociology. And, how difficult it is to swim against the tide if you have a different idea that isn't vatted by your peers .
sd	I haven't, got too, far into it yet.
sd	So I got them out of the library and decided I'd read some more in them.
sd	So, I read a lot of history and, a few novels, occasional mystery stories, just, for fun.
b	Yeah.
sv	That's, a nifty idea.
ba	Great.
sv	I think the, the boom to parents and the shoelace department was those little Velcro tabs .
sv	I think that's incredibly .
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qw	What do you think is, the most promising, or practical book, of that kind you've read recently?
b	Uh huh.
sd	He was teaching,
sd	 from time to time out here, we have four different P B S channels that we can get on the cable .
sd	And, they'll have all ten of those shown back to back, in the middle of the night , for people can video tape them.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sv	there's some, absolutely wonderful illustrated, children's books.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	right.
sv	and, there are so many that look like they would just be absolutely wonderful.
sd	But I was tickled to see that some publisher is, reprinting the James Thurber books for children. THE, WONDERFUL O and THE THIRTEEN CLOCKS, that have been out of print for I think about twenty years.
sd	and they really did, enjoy them.
sd	 but they were, old copies then.
sd	But, I, was really happy to see that,
sd	Unfortunately, we are not much into recycling.
sd	I just don't . just from socializing with her
sd	they're given three baskets
sd	and they put them out on a certain day of the week
sv	and some of the communities that do, the residents are having to pay to participate in it. Which really doesn't make sense.
ba	that's good.
sd	You have to go to different places to do that.
sv	it just doesn't make sense to me.
b	Yeah.
ba^r	that's good.
b	Uh huh.
nn	No.
sd	I didn't know that.
b	Yeah.
sd	or you know, I read those little slips that come in to your, utility bills or your, garbage collection
sd	and they haven't, you know, talked about doing something like that .
sd	and she takes her own bags to the grocery store .
sd	I, I really don't think she has any paper products in her house.
sd	And she does make a lot of sense.
sd	Just her whole house is like wow.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	I don't know if you know the little character Barney.
sd	and he's really caught on.
sv	so that's really neat .
o	That's it.
qy	Do you like the way some people in there for instance, really take over and, we have no way, of knowing whether they are legitimately right or wrong and so forth.
qo	What do you think about these things?
bf	so you're saying you think the judge should actually have the final say?
sd^e	I know what you mean.
sd	Well, I hadn't, thought of it from that point of view before.
sv	and, what bothers me is I was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury to adequately understand what was being presented so that they themselves could make a proper and, accurate decision.
sv	But I also think that the jury should be, more carefully selected to make sure that they are entirely intelligent people and that they understand some of the details that are involved so that they can make accurate decisions.
sv	and they just make a decision based on whether they like the dress she wore that day or whether that guy smiled or growled all the time.
sv	That's no way to make a decision on some terrible problem.
sd	we would have fifty percent of them law students, anyway . Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life when they see what it is like to be in the jury side of a trial.
sv^m	That would be a really good thing to do.
ba	For goodness sakes.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	they saw the husband, get,
b	Yeah.
^2	They would find something wrong with it.
qy	Did they really?
b	Uh huh.
sv	You'd think there would be enough, people who saw the accident other than his wife, to also, make statements,
sv	So if they say a certain way, then why not believe them.
b	Yeah.
qy	do you use credit cards?
bf	So it doesn't get , the credit,
qy^g	if you're going to use credit cards you need to use that policy, I think, don't you? .
sv	Otherwise, you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that it's hardly, it's not a very good idea.
sd^e	but I don't use them very much, though.
sv	The other thing, I think if you do get overextended a little bit, you need to be sure and pay it off, more than one at a time, because I think you could run forever paying what they require.
sv	Just goes on and on.
b	Yeah.
aa	that's true.
sv	There are times, when it's very useful, like, emergency trip, or something.
sv	I think, they're very helpful, plus the fact that it's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes.
sv	or you end up in deep trouble.
b	Uh huh.
sd	If you, if you pay for everything by cash, there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit when you need something like a house or, a car.
sv	so they have become a very vital part of our monetary system , over the last few years.
sv	and an awful lot of people are in trouble.
sd	and he makes calls to people who have problems, you know, credit problems, that are trying to work out
sd	and, . Poor thing he comes home very depressed every night , because the world has so many problems of that sort,
sv	so it's, it's, it's, it's a really big problem I think, and, takes mature people to treat it,
sv	so that it's a real advantage to you, instead of a disadvantage.
b	Yeah.
bf^g	It didn't do you any good now, does it?
sv	Even before it probably wasn't, though, because you didn't get anywhere near as much as what it, you didn't get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying.
fc	It's good to talk to you.
fc	bye now .
qw	What is your favorite show?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Sure.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I watch just about anything, but not a lot of, T V.
sd	I mean I'll watch, you know, maybe a little while when I first get home in the evening.
sd	and then I'll watch that HARD COPY or or that kind of thing, you know,
sd	and I like the NINE ONE ONE, and UNSOLVED MYSTERIES.
b	Uh huh.
sd	my husband is really crazy about EVENING SHADE that comes on Monday evening.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	And I've got to where every Monday I rush around so I could sit and watch that with him because it's really funny.
sd	so we've got to where we will sit, and watch it on Monday night,
sd	Like I say I'm not,
sd	and the one with the sergeant that married the woman with the kids, Sergeant McGillis .
sd	Sergeant, MAJOR DAD.
sd	that comes on right after, the EVENING SHADE and then MURPHY BROWN, and DESIGNING WOMEN.
sd	and I watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others, as I can.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, you can't hardly watch KNOTS LANDING with the little kids around though.
sv	Except they, probably are in bed, by nine.
qy	Did you get your pizza taken care of?
qy	Have you watched that?
sv	you know, it's really pretty good.
sv	I mean, it's kind of like, you know, soap opera I guess.
sv	It's been pretty good. Some, pretty good acting.
sd	Now I watched, BROOKLYN BRIDGE this week for the first time,
sd	I liked it.
sd	Now I haven't seen I'LL FLY AWAY yet.
bf	It's nearly, too late for T V.
sd	I get in, from work
sd	so I have to get up and do dinner, and everything.
b	Uh huh.
sd	If we are home on the weekend, we always watch videos,
sv	I really probably should watch more of them than I do.
sd	and, And I don't just spend all my time,
sd	and my husband, now he sits and watches T V constantly.
b^r	uh huh.
sd	I could be around here for hours myself and never have it on.
sd	and I'll have to watch that I'LL FLY AWAY this week.
b	Yeah.
sd	I never get in in time for any of those.
fc	Well, it's nice talking with you.
fc	Bye.
sv	but I guess medical insurance is probably what I consider the second most important.
sv	no matter what you do about that, yeah, unless you're like a Senior V P or something which I am not .
sd	And then when you interview for a job or something sometimes people, expect the benefits to take the place of a certain salary level.
qy	are you married?
sd	and he has other things he takes.
sv	So I mean in that kind of situation it's really almost, redundant, you know,
sd	You know that some of the benefits, I would rather have, money.
sd	more money, actually, Or flex time or something that was a little more personal, you know.
qy^d	you don't use the medical insurance?
qy^d	You use your company's?
qw	Where does he work if you don't mind me,
qw	What's the name of that company ?
qw	What do they do?
qy	Are they a big Company
sv	see, that's probably cause Canada has the, government run health care systems, social medicine.
sd	You don't pay a dime.
^g	You know?
ba	Sounds wonderful.
sd	if I were, him, I'd tell him make sure he stays there.
sd	but, and we take my dental, his medical.
sv	And the medical I mean, I think it's terrible, you know?
sd	but then they're getting ready to change it again for Aetna.
sd	and, you know, T I just did the thing where, with the smoking premiums.
qy	but do you know about the smoking premiums?
qy	do you guys smoke?
b	yeah.
sv@	you don't sound like you're in this category, but I mean for extremely obese people or something?* needs slash unit note punctuation The kind of people that can't sit in the airplane chair, you know?
qh	You know, who's going to croak first? The people that smoke or, you know?
sv	Seems like, an unnecessary penalty,
sd	but I just, you know, I don't how they can do it.
sd*	Carte blanket . / * listen: probably closer to "carte blanche"
b	Yeah.
sv	but, That's why I'm not a boss, I guess .
sv	They have to be a little bit different than the American,
b	Uh huh.
sd	T I is at least, five years,
b	Yeah.
ba	my goodness.
sv	but that's a pretty standard thing anymore.
sv	You know, husband's company probably matches more than T I, though.
br	they do ?
sv	That's still pretty good, though. I mean the fact that your vested that quickly in the pension.
sd	I think E D S has seven to eight years.
sd	So it's like T I in that respect, you know?
sd	and, I mean, and I'm working for a company that's making money .
sd	You know, E D S has a cash flow problem as they say but, not E D S, T I,
sv	I think everywhere they just need to sit down and hire some people, the grunts, as I call them, like myself to tell them,
sd	like T I has, no day care.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I would, think so,
sv	and the other thing I think is really good is that E D S is much better than T I at, I think, right now than, that we have day care, the health program like T I has Texans?
sv	But I don't think it, that it's developed as much as it could be for the size company as T I.
sv	I mean if you ever walked into E D S s health, corner court health clubs on site and you walk into Spring Creek, well, Spring Creek's better than the one on Dallas Parkway
h	but, I mean, yeah.
ny	yeah.
sv	You know, instead of like six, treadmills, you've got like twenty.
sd	And E D S can't even compare in size. In terms of the number of employees.
sd	I guess it's just where and like E D S reimburses you for adoption.
sd	And T I doesn't have anything like that.
sv	You know, so I guess I wish the companies like T I and a lot of others were more progressive in that respect
sv	I mean they have very strange like dress codes
sd	you can't wear slacks at the corporate site and that kind of thing unless you're in a, y , you know,
sd	but there aren't manufacturing environments because of the type of company it is.
sv	I guess I also wish that, companies would look more at cost of living increases instead of just merit reviews.
aa@	Oh. Yeah,
aa	exactly.
aa	I know.
aa	I know.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I mean, I mean, I don't know how you and your husband are, too,
sd(^q)	And I said, hey, I'll probably do this even if I'm a millionaire which I won't, ever be.
sv	I mean, it seems like every time you try to get ahead and take a vacation or something well, the car insurance is due .
b	yeah.
sd	I don't know what we're going to do about,
sd	I didn't say that.
sv	It's probably been too hot today for either of us to,
sd	Usually people are all over the country.
aa	This is true.
sv	It's, just something you have to keep telling yourself, you know, that, that's what I want, that, you know,
sv	and people are lucky to have any kind of benefits.
sd(^q)	And I went, you know, that has to be rough.
sv	I guess one thing I'd like to see, too, and I don't know how T I is about this, but I'd like to see, employees rank and file be able to contribute more the execution of their job.
sv	that's a good word for it,
qw	How is T I in that mode?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
bf	All part of a good old boy network,
b	Uh huh.
sd	They're pretty much if that's where the widget goes, stick it in the hole, you know.
sd	They're kind of formula oriented.
qh	so, You know, what can you tell them ?
ba	Really.
b	Okay ?
fc	and keep cool.
fp	Hi Ed.
fp	Hi.
qw	Who wrote that?
b	I see.
b	Right.
sv	That is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And, they have not made a movie of the week of it yet.
b	Yeah.
sd^m*	Explained , /* listen; could be br
qy^d	Supposedly scooped up by the triangle.
b	Yeah.
qy	On that same topic, have you ever read anything about, you know, the Amelia Earhart story, whatever happened with her?
sv	I am sure there is something out there, ,
sd	Well whatever, this is one aspect of it.
sv	and it makes you think about things.
sv	That is for sure.
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean, usually, if I find a good book, I will sit, you know, for two days until it is finished. If it's that good,
sd	and that was PRESUMED INNOCENT.
sv	It's just, incredible.
b	Yeah.
sd	and I think I did read Tom Wolfe and VANITY,
aa	yeah.
sv	the movie was nothing compared to the book.
b	Yeah.
sv	I mean, because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive, when it comes to, you know, pinpointing, so , society's ills and, things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things
sv	and, and so, it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie .
sd	but, gee, I like to read gardening books and things like that. Just to tell me what to do with my garden
b	Yeah.
sd	and I have never gotten to it .
b	Oh.
sv	Our lives are built around foods that we like and, nutritionally good for us.
qw	What kind of dining out do you like?
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	Pancho's, that's, a new one.
b	Uh huh.
sd	We have one called Chi Chi's in our area.
qy	Isn't it Mexican?
qy	Do you have it there?
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, I love Mexican food myself.
ad	But you go ahead now .
b	Uh huh.
ba	boy that is wonderful.
sv	I can almost live on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if I had to.
ng	but I haven't been there.
qw	Where did you go to college?
br^m	the U S , Naval Academy?
b	Uh huh.
fe	I'll be darn.
sd	and, all my work has been in research for the Navy .
sd	Underwater acoustics.
no	I have dealt with nearly all of the research laboratories that the country has.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	you grew up in Orlando.
sd	Well, that's what I worked on.
sd	The end of last month.
na	I certainly have .
sv	but, I guess we should continue on,
b^m	Okay.
qw	How do you like Chinese food?
sd	Well, I, enjoy the Szechuan type of, Chinese food.
ny	Yes.
sv	but, it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals.
sd	just at home.
sv	When you find the right cookbook, why it works out.
fe	boy.
b	right.
sd	Isabelle Chang.
sv	I think you will enjoy that.
qr	Phil, I guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work, or do you like to do it?
b	Yeah.
qrr	or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn?
ba	Well, that's pretty good.
sd	but this is the first time that I really have to landscape a house.
sd	It's not on a main road.
sd	and it has nothing .
sd	I think we figured out total, this is for vegetables about two thirds of an acre.
sd	So we each have a third of an acre we do.
sv	That's a lot .
sd	and he's been there for a long time
sd	so, it just happens they built a shopping center next to it
sd	and we grow a lot of food.
sd	you have to step down in them now because we've tilled them so much,
sd	But I wish this phone would stop screeching,
sv	It's not getting any better.
b	okay.
sd	I mean it's been dropped on the floor a hundred times.
^q	Can you hear me.
b	Yeah.
sd	we grow a lot of, the basic, corn, potatoes.
sd	and, acorn squash are good winter keepers.
sd	I mean, things the way we grow are carrots, cabbage, that sort of goes to waste
sd	She plants a lot of tomatoes
sd	But she helps me a lot, too.
h	Something,
sd	so. I wish I knew more to tell you why,
b	Yeah
ba	that's really weird.
sd	like you say, they cross pollinate just by bees,
^2	Something weird.
sd	this last season it was too wet up here
sd	and we got half our yield.
sd	It was really bad because of the water.
aa	Yeah.
sd	and I'm going to have a seven yard truck come in with some top soil.
sd	my problem is I want to use those rail ties to build up a planter
sd	but I don't know if the creosote in the rail ties is going to do something, you know, if I want to grow a tomato or something in there
sv	I mean, I guess it'd go with my flowers.
sd	I always thought I'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird
sd	And I don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated.
ar	but they put, some kind of chemicals in there too.
sd	so no goi , I'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there.
sd	my flower gardens are always been like on the ground.
sv	it just looks so much better when it's up against the house, tiered up.
sd(^q)	and the landlord cut it down and said, Yeah, that's one thing you have to do is keep that lilac bush cut down so it doesn't rub up against the siding
sd	Anything, as long as it doesn't rub up against the siding.
sv	and then the people that do have them, they spread, and they sprout all over their lawn.
sv	And people who do have them, curse.
sd	they aren't trimmed at all.
sd	and the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns on it.
sd	So we're going to get a chain saw and limb it extensively so it gets the trees up overhead,
sd	because I can just see brushing up against it, that it would rip your skin.
sv	Many times worse, because of course, it's a tree.
sd	My husband will have problems borrowing one.
qy^d	you have pets, I understand, a couple of them.
qw	What are they?
sv	they think they own you .
sv	you probably don't know po ,
sd	when Beauregard was talking he was the dog, remember.
sd(^q)	and he used to say, pets can be most as much trouble as kids, if they work at it a little bit, and even more when they work at it a little bit .
sv	And I think that's true,
b	uh huh.
ba	Th , co , just good company, that's neat.
sd	Now we don't actually have a pet right now.
sd	I got it so it wouldn't shed, one of these, French Poodle, a little French Poodle.
sd	and we only had him about three or four weeks before he was hit by a car,
sd	but I cannot believe the whole family just, he just got in to us so quickly,
sd	I could not believe it.
sd	I have to tell you about our most interesting pet, though.
sd	we had an iguana living with us for about, about two and a half years I guess.
sd	name was Clyde.
sv	I think there was one in the school, zoology department, you know, or biology department, one or the other, anyway,
sd(^q)	and I said you've got to be kidding, I'm not going to live with a lizard .
sd	and then they move and about scares you to death sometimes.
nn	No,
sd^e	he had full run of the house.
sd	He just loved to sit on the back of my dryer where the heat came up out of the dryer, you know.
sd	when we'd have family home evening and everybody would sit in the living room and the fire would be burning he'd walk across my feet sometimes .
sd	He'd come out to the kitchen, just kind of look at me until I went and got him something out of the refrigerator.
sd	and, you know, you could see him just enjoying it like a cat does.
sv	and , kids loved him,
sd	And Dan was a drummer,
sd	and he, the only thing he didn't like very well was the drumming.
sv	like he was trying to hi , , protect himself,
sd	and then he'd leave the room .
sv	well they take on human characteristics like, our other animal,
sd	and he just brought this Norwegian elkhound an, home
sd	and he'd pick up his dish and throw it in the air . And then bark and march around, you know,
sd	and then he'd pick up his dish again and throw it in the air until we came out and gave him some water.
br	Did what?
sd^e	he didn't eat flies.
sd^e	they eat greens.
sd	and he'd eat the outside leaves.
sd	and he'd eat outside except you had to keep him away from the garden because he liked to eat the little peas as fast as they came up, you know.
sd	he liked that.
sd^e	when Dan went up to college up at Ricksun , Idaho he took him with him,
sd	they found him the next day in a tree,
sd	and he wouldn't lay on it until we changed the covers.
sd^e	he wouldn't lay on it.
sd	h , he went to the bathroom in the bathroom.
sd	well we put some papers on the floor, underneath the john
sd	but, but even when he had an accident or something,
sd	and you could just vacuum it up.
sd	And in the summertime when he was outside and eating outside the smell was a little bit like a cat, you know.
sd	and that's been years ago.
sv	But it's, it was interesting.
qw	Well, what do your cats do besides sitting and purring and letting you pet them .
bf	and you just kind of took them, over,
b^r	uh huh.
sv	 We , I think,
am	that could be.
ba	pretty ones.
b^m	Newhart, .
b	Yeah,
qw	what do you think about, the self insurance business?
b	Uh huh.
sv	and I think eventually the number of people that can afford health insurance, as it is now getting squeezed and squeezed tighter.
sv	I think the medical profession is just pushing until there's no option but the government take it over
sd	and, it was ligaments, in her knee, as it turned out,
sd	I mean, he knows knee problems okay,
sd	Now, a, thousand, dollars for thirty five minutes.
sv	and they solved these problems,
sv	but there's, no doubt they get kickbacks to fill these machines up night and day.
sd	They don't have to pay them back in three months time.
sd	but there was a, deal where a doctor was going to be sued for malpractice on the death on an infant.
sd	it doesn't make logical sense to me,
sd	In our state right now, recently they've had a lot of, the rapists, murder type, killers going around
sd	and they're in there.
sd^e	Wisconsin, and Milwaukee area, you know.
sd	and, I know, in Minnesota, they had, the one that just, got out and went after a, college student and raped, and killed her
sv	and they are not too happy about that now, I guess,
sd	and, they get their names in the paper
sd	and they become big celebrities.
qy^g	Well, I know one thin , I think Texas has the death penalty, right?
b	Yeah.
nn^r	no.
sd	but, the person that's caught, he'll never do it again if he gets the death penalty.
sv	and there are a lot of repeaters.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	and when they get back out, they just go into worse crimes.
sv	Maybe they should try and separate them a little bit more.
b	Yeah.
sv	If you want to stop the crime, I think you've got to get, the people when they are kids.
sv	A lot of this probably just starts from the, from the homes. Also from the, the media, the T V s,
sv	all these, gory movies on there becomes, just a natural fact of life.
aa	Yeah.
sd	well, they probably won't sensor so much the sexual stuff as much as the violent.
sd	I'm ready if you are.
sv	Especially if they go hunting,
sd	he's read books about guns since he was like probably eleven or twelve years old.
sv	As far as just having handguns around to have them, I don't believe that you should have handguns around.
sd	There's too many sports people out there that do do these things.
am	well I suppose you could.
sv	And I think if they want one, they're going to get one.
sv	like I say, if they want a gun they're going to find out somehow to get one.
sd	in fact I had bought my son a rifle like for a Christmas present one time.
h	Now there might be now.
sd	But there wasn't anything for, you know, rifles and things like that.
sv	I guess it was just handguns that there was a, some kind of a waiting, you know, two weeks while they checked you out or something.
sv	But, most of these people that's got these guns that's going around, you know, robbing people and shooting people,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I was just wondering how that did work, if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show.
qy^g	You don't have to wait or nothing then
sd	I was just curious, you know, because,
sd	I know at the regular you know, gun shop that you, that you do have to wait for pistols, like a couple of weeks
sd	and you go pick it up.
sv	I think there is something like that.
sv	Anyhow, out here in California, I think there is now.
sd	Now we don't have guns because we don't go hunting or anything like that.
sd	like, I think his first little rifle that we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old.
sd	He likes to go to that, shotgun thing where you shoot at those,
sd	He likes to do that you know .
h	But, I don't know.
sv	But as far as just banning it completely, that's not going to happen.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	right.
sd	Now I do believe though, like in California, if a little kid gets a hold of a gun that someone has I think they're liable now for,
sd	they can be, you know, put in jail and everything. whoever owned the gun.
sv	You know, now when they have kids around, you'd think that they would be locking them up
b	Uh huh.
^2	Well they can get into almost anything anymore .
qy	do you think we're paying too much?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	How true.
sv	that's not what I would consider a luxury.
b	Yeah.
sv	so we can't really do a whole lot about how that money is spent and where it goes
sv	But not really.
b	Yeah.
sv	and, you know, they're studying some obscure bug, you know, in some other part of the world or some such thing,
sv	and I think that's wrong.
aa	That's right.
sv	And I think here lately they've been saying quite often and maybe somebody's coming to realize we're the nation in trouble.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And I think that's a mistake.
sv	Somewhere, you know, we have to realize that we can't just keep giving it away.
sv	We know what trouble they got into .
b	Yeah.
sv	but you will at least double that amount
sv	but they really stick it to you big time.
aa	Absolutely.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	That's a lot.
sv	I don't have any idea.
b	Yeah.
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	So, the real amount of your savings on that is, not much.
sv	You know, it's kind of a vicious circle there.
sv	And then, at a took that away as far as being,
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
ad	Well, you can come over to my house and spend it .
sd^e	I just don't have any.
sv^t	Well, I guess we probably talked just about long enough.
b	Yeah.
ny	Yes.
ny	Uh huh.
h	I don't know.
fc	You too.
fc	Okay.
qo	Well what do you think about the everyday occurrences that are an invasion of your privacy?
b	Right.
sd	I mean, my wife and I, seems like we get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing and rings up until ten, eleven o'clock sometimes.
sv	that's true.
sv	that's true.
sd	and a lot of days I'll get two and three calls, from from people selling insurance you know, to the small business man
sd	and, California, always trying to sell something, oil investments or stock investments or whatever.
sd	And now I'm getting the same calls at the house.
sd	and, credit card companies, they sell your name.
aa	I know. Yes.
sd	American Express does that, by the way.
sd^e	I understand they you know, they sell names because it's quite profitable to them.
sv	you're right.
sv	that's true.
sd	magazine companies, from subscriptions do the same thing
sd	it's the way they make additional money.
sv	so your name is valuable to, I guess, X amount of solicitors calling.
qw	what do you, where are you from?
sd	we live in the Dallas area, Richardson.
bk	Okay .
bh	Did you?
sd	I've talked to people in Utah, people in New York
sd	and I'll get people you know, from out of the state.
sv	Not from Texas.
bk	right.
sd	My wife's from New Jersey.
sd	from, Saddle River.
b	Okay.
sv	Well, that's nice, too.
sv	so she's been away for quite a while.
sd	so they just they over there in New Jersey.
sd	but that's the biggest one I can think of is just all the solicitors calling.
aa	I know.
sd	I might start using the answering machine more, because it's so hard to not pick up that phone when it rings.
b	Right.
b	Sure.
sv	you're probably right.
sv	it's hard to believe there's that many deputy sheriffs associations
sd	they call you one time to send three kids to the car , carnival or circus
ad	I'll let you go first.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I spent a couple, years down in, Plano, Texas.
sd	And, I was one of the home owners down there that got taxed to death, for the, Plano, school system.
sd	And, you know, I know that Texas doesn't have a state tax,
sd	and so all the things come out of the property taxes,
sd	I was better off paying a state tax back in Maryland, where, ,
sd	what they did in Maryland to get around that is they developed a renters tax solely for the purpose of paying for the services, that the renters were getting including the, educational services.
sd	so when, long, long time ago, when I used to live in apartments, I would pay a rent payment every month and a tax payment every month.
sd	And the tax payment went to pay for the services that I was getting as a resident of that particular county.
sd	Here in Maryland a certain portion of your property taxes, goes to education,
sd	but also a portion of the state tax that you pay goes back into the county that you live in, to pay for the educational system.
sd	like Collin County, would only equal about maybe an eighth the size of Baltimore County, here in Maryland.
sd	I mean the counties are much larger.
sv	You know, in the whole state of Maryland I believe there's only like, fifteen counties.
qy	the flip side to this is, are we getting what we're paying for,
sd	and I heard a report because, of, the emphasis that the President was putting on education, you know, him running as our education president and then finally a couple of years later getting around to doing something.
sd	in other words, they came up with this federalized system where everyone in the third grade would be taught basically the same thing.
sd	and everybody in the fourth grade's basically taught the same thing.
sd	and since it's inception, they've, the prices paid by the federal government per student has been thirty three percent.
sd	and that's real dollars, you know, adjusting it back to the days, you know, when it started, probably, you know, seventy years ago.
sd	And what they've said is that we haven't had a thirty three percent improvement in education.
sd	We've actually gone backwards.
b	Yeah.
sd	well, they've been having some problems, even here in, like Baltimore City which is, a, goo , good sized city.
sd	and of course they've, been cutting the teachers salaries, because they say we don't have the money to do it
sd	and, all the services are costing more money and everything,
sv	but a lot of emphas , now is being put on, you know, when children used to be taught, you know, like, each child is individual,
sv	and some students do horrible until like eighth grade,
sv	some do horrible, you know, until they get to like tenth grade,
sv	And then there are some students that, you know, read well at five years old, and, you know, seem to excel.
sd	And so the, you know, one of the things I heard proposed on, one of the public radio stations up here was that we should go back to teaching children at their own speed. Some ki ,
b	Yeah.
sv	and, and on top of that they make the child feel inferior, because he's not as good as another kid his same age.
sv	I mean, like, you know, that's ridiculous.
sd	and, you know, I, I have five children total,
sd	and I have two that are in, eighth grade this year.
sd	when they were in elementary school they were identified as being slow.
sd	they're a set of twins, a boy and a girl.
sd	Last year the, boy twin started doing real well.
sd	and this year it happened for the daughter.
sd	She just has been, really doing great this year
sd	and she has the right attitude towards school and everything.
sd	I remember when I was in school, I did horrible up until about, yeah, about the seventh, eighth grade
sd	and basically I got interested in math, and, never really did well in english
sv	but, you know once you got interested in something and things started to click in place then after that you take off.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	but. they really stress academics there.
sd	And, God, if your child is not an honor student, well then, you're, something wrong with you as a parent.
sd	And that's kind of the way they are there.
sd	And, when we moved back to Maryland, I moved to a, Baltimore County which is a northern county in Maryland,
sd	and it's basically a rural county, once you get above about the half way point.
sd	we went from a, middle school in Texas that served fifty five square blocks to a, middle school in Maryland that served fifty five square miles.
sv	And it was just a complete culture shock, because I mean, they're riding on the bus in the morning with, other kids that, you know, are a sleep because they got up at three o'clock and were doing chores
sd	but it's, agricultural.
sd	And where they had to raise a small animal.
sd	Had to learn how to drive a tractor.
sd	They loved it.
sv	and you know, it made school fun for them again because prior to that school was just a big pain, a drain.
sv	It was like, kind of like the way we feel about going to work .
sv	and they seem to really enjoy it.
qw	what kind of fishing do you enjoy?
qy^d	So, you like fresh water.
b	I see .
sd	Well, I was raised on the Texas gulf coast, in the summers,
sd	and during the Christmas holidays we'd go down to our house on the coast
sd	and so, I thought fish came out of the ocean
sd	and anything that was fresh water was muddy
sd	so I didn't learn to fish in a lake until I was well into my twenties
sd	so I had always been a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun.
sv	There's so many different ways to catch fish.
sv	but it's a lot of fun.
sd	So, I grew up fishing.
qw	What area of lakes do you like?
b	I see.
sv	I think I know where, Lake Caddo, or something like that.
sd	If it's supposed to be one of the best bass fishing places. They hold tournaments there, and everything.
sd	I really don't want to share a boat with a snake.
sd	I, I, I don't see it.
sd	I'd make some quick arrangements
sd	and I've told so many stories about the snakes
sd	you know, when they pull in, there's a snake instead of a fish, and things like that
h	I don't know,
qw	What's the largest fish you ever caught?
sv*	On a like that's not a bad size fish. / * listen; transcript should probably read "lake" not "like"
sd	I would be impressed .
sd	I've never done that.
sv	and there's just so many other ways live down there.
sv	It's not a treat
sd	it's what you do every day.
sd	one of my favorite things was, we were forever catching crab and steaming them you know, out on the beach and you know, just, pitching them out, on, what am I trying to say, newspaper and, breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them, and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know
sd	and that's it.
sd	but, the other little creatures would take care of what was left.
sd	So, going out on a boat, never did appeal to me simply because you know, there was so much else to do.
sd	I lived in Dallas.
sd	We had a house in Port Aransas.
sd	It's a little fishing village that is, Corpus.
ar	Well, South Padre is on down the bend
sd	it's like if you drew a line from Austin straight down, it would be in that region.
sd	Small island.
b	okay.
qy	Was it bad?
ba	I hate to hear that.
b	Huh uh.
aa^r	no.
sd	I have a favorite hotel that extends out over the water
qy	what is it, the Flagship?
qy	Is it still there?
sd	I like that place.
sd	I didn't realize that had happened, for some reason.
sd	Well, of course, being raised on the water I'd never swim in it.
aa	Huh uh.
sv	Swimming is for swimming, pool.
sv	That's why they call them swimming pools .
sv	You do not swim in the ocean.
aa^m	No.
sd	but huge sharks are down there.
sv	I mean incredibly large sharks.
sd	some of the young dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night
sd	it was incredible the size of them,
sd	the next morning they would have them strung up across the getties
sd	their tails would still hang on the bottom of the getties
sd	I won't have anything to do with.
qy	have you had very many of these calls?
ba	How wonderful.
fc	I enjoyed talking to you.
fc	Bye bye.
sv	I think we're supposed to discuss our view of the Soviet Union as a continuing threat to the United States.
qo	How do you feel about that.
sd	They're very large
sv	and they can become very quickly a large financial burden, as one more stepchild we have to carry around.
sd	but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they couldn't get anyone to harvest it.
sd(^q)	And the people in the city were saying, well why should I go do that. Make the government do that, that's not my job.
fc	I've enjoyed talking to you.
fc	bye,
qy^d	and, probably the first question would be whether you've ever had to go through that process.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
qy^d	So it was pretty much a physical decision?
qrr	or was she kind of opposed to it?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and so often they think they're adequately caring for themselves when they're really not eating or very balanced meals.
sd	It really is.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	I do that right now,
sd	and I'm not near nursing home age.
qrr^d	or probably in College Station there wasn't a whole lot of choice.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	That's a given.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Adapt.
sv	but the places like Presbyterian Village and some of the retirement places where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better, as far as elderly people adapting.
sd	They're able to move in while they're still independent and still social
sv	It's really kind of difficult.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And that scares me the thought of forcing somebody to do something.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bf	Not as independence.
b	Yeah.
b^r	Uh huh.
sv	And the quality of life really isn't there.
ba	it really is.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, they fear being dependent on somebody.
sd	She can't accept that we want to be the care givers.
sd	Well, she stayed in a temporary nursing home. Until she was okay.
sd	She's down in Temple
sv	and we're all heading that way
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^g	they're not, are they.
sd	even the bench warmer, I would.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
sd	and we go quite often, to watch the Rangers.
sd	we're heavy into that too.
aa	I do too.
sv	And I think, what caught so many of our attentions last year was that Nolan Ryan, you know,
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
sv	I know it,
sv	as far as predictions and stuff, I really think the Rangers may come out real strong this year.
sd	but last year I just figured they was under a lot of pressure because of all the publicity and everything,
sd	I really do.
sv	at least, that should help,
sv	it sure should.
sd	and of course, there's a few more, you know, I think are good ball teams also.
"	I really do.
sd	I like to go watch the Giants when they come to Houston some times.
bh	you haven't?
sd	I have a few times.
sv	they're a good ball team.
sv	They really are.
qh	wouldn't it though .
qh^m	Wouldn't it.
qy^g	we might actually get to go to a World Series,
ny	yeah.
sv	That's something you dream about.
sv	but, last year I was kind of thinking he sure did get in a slump.
sd	But they're saying this year, their predictions is that he's really going to come out of it and, be on top.
qh	Isn't he though,
sd	He either hits home run or strike out.
sd	There is not ever a in between for him.
b	yeah.
sd^m	To sign him again,
sv	you never know.
sv	if you offer them money, I'm sure they'll, they'll do a little bit of everything.
aa^r	no,
no	I hadn't heard.
sd	I really haven't,
b	Oh yeah.
sd	Well I hadn't either,
sv	I don't even guess they've even thought about sending the schedules out yet.
sd	We usually order our tickets way in advance.
sd	we try to go so often.
aa	they do.
fc	Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.
fc	And, hopefully we'll get to talk again.
fc	bye bye.
qy	Well, how about you, are you an exercise fanatic?
sd	Me either .
qy	Do you?
ba	Wonderful. Uh huh.
o*	Way. / * what is this?
sv	That's the way to do it.
sd	it's just a chore, you know,
sv	and that will get me where I'll have to do it, you know,
sd	and they were offering a walking class, where you know, you have to walk, you know, like for every mile you walk and every so many minutes, you get points, you know,
sd	and, at the end of the semester you go back in and like your final exam is a three mile walk.
sd	this many minutes you get a B,
sd	like about the middle of the semester I ended up having to have surgery on my foot,
sd	and this has been a couple of years ago,
sd	and I just ended up having to drop the class.
sd	you know, by the time the final came around, I wasn't even where I could wear a shoe yet, let alone walk three miles, you know.
sd	But, that was the only time I have ever been able to like start an exercise program and really stick to it, because then I had to go every week and log in what I had walked,
sd	and, my teacher looked at it every week, you know.
sv	But, other than that you know, I kind of get in the mood every once in awhile, say, okay, I'm going to start going to aerobics now, you know,
sv(^q)	and, I'll go for like two weeks and go, this is for the birds, this is too much work.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	you're amazed at how much that adds up.
sd	I was on, Nutri Systems for a while,
sd	when you come to your Nutri System meeting, don't park in the parking place outside the front door, park at the other end, you know,
sv	You know, when you're sitting watching T V at night, during every commercial get up off the couch, go to the living room and get a glass of water, go to the bedroom and make the bed, go do something, but get up during every commercial. And, things like that.
sv	And, you'd be surprised at how much just that little bit adds up, you know, just gives you a little more activity
sv	especially when you're like us and don't really want to do it anyway.
b	Yeah.
sv	I'm more into, you know, sitting, than I am ,
sd	I have a two year old,
sv(^q)	and I have found really though, I'm kind of the opposite, I'm more active now with him, than I was before, because now, you know, he'll "I want to go outside" and I'll go outside with him
h	I don't know.
sv	Just chasing him around the house, you know, will be plenty for you.
sv	You've kind of gotten out of that little stage there.
ba	lucky you,
sv	you're getting into even more interesting stages.
b^r	yeah
sv	Same thing, the terrible twos repeat at about thirteen .
sv	How interesting, I can hardly wait .
b	Yeah.
sv	that walkabout's a good program.
sd	and we did do it for a long time,
sd	so I had to pick Ryan up, you know,
sv	there's always an excuse, you know, to not do it
aa^r	I'm sure.
^2	to the mall, to the movies, to the friends, to the,
sv	Sounds like fun.
fc	Well, it was really good to talk to you.
fc	talk to you later.
sd	I haven't given this matter enough thought.
nn	No,
sd	I work for N I S T .
b	Uh huh.
b^m	And now,
qo	and how do people feel about it?
sv	that's a very different issue.
qy	does the testing cover alcohol as well as illegal drugs?
qy	So they ask you to declare beforehand what prescription drugs you are taking?
sd	but they don't say in advance ,
bf	The ones that would kind of constitute controlled substances or something anyway .
bf	So what they are asking you to tell them is all the prescription drugs you are taking which are controlled substances.
qy	Is Contact a, Bo ,
qy	Is Contact a, substance?
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qo	how do you feel about them?
b	Yeah.
sd	as soon as we get our bills, we pay it off.
sd	We tore all the rest of them up.
sd	if you're on a trip or something, you don't have to take a whole bunch of, you know, cash with you,
sd	but I don't like using them because I've seen too many people that used them and ended up bankrupt or on, chapter thirteen and stuff like that.
sv	Because they have this weird opinion that if you use that card, you don't have to pay for it.
sv	and it seems like ...
b	Uh huh.
qy	Are you married?
sd	I mean, that was her goal, you know, got to have a credit card,
sd	but she wanted to establish some credit,
sd(^q)	You know, and I'm thinking woman, , wake up and smell the roses before they come and get you.
sd	and people don't see that either.
sd	The only one that we have that we kept was the Discover card,
sd	and it pays you to use it. I mean, if you pay your bill off right away, if you don't ever have to pay any interest on it because they give you a certain amount every time that you use it,
sd	I mean, you have to pay the interest, not pay it right off,
sd	plus they don't have that, charge on it, you know,
ny	Yeah.
sd	we could have credit cards running down our ears.
sv	I just can't see it.
b	Yeah.
sd	I know it,
sd	she's in college,
sd	You know, somebody sent them something free.
sd	it's some weird name of a credit card,
^q	That's how you got on to it to start with, you know, what is the matter with this person, .
h	But, that's just the way I feel about it.
b	, yeah.
sd	but I don't know why I didn't.
b	, uh huh.
b	, yeah.
qy^g	I mean, you didn't go out and charge a whole bunch and lose everything, did you?
^g	right?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
fp	Hello.
qw	What's going on?
qy	Are you sure?
qy^t	Don't they usually tell you to say something?
b	Oh.
sd	we're supposed to talk about lawn and garden.
qy	What do I do?
sd	Well, I cut it occasionally.
qy	is that good?
sd	And I edge it occasionally.
qh	see, am I good, or what?
sd	And, much beyond that I don't do .
qy^d	he is going to build you a fence.
b	Uh huh.
br	What, for a fence?
qy	well, I thought, isn't he the same one?
b	Yeah.
sd	I don't know.
b	Yeah.
ad	but you know, you ought to get him to pull the weeds.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	so you haven't pulled any weeds lately?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	goody.
sd	I thought you were going to say there I thought you were going to say there was a snake in the weeds .
ba	God, .
b	Yeah.
qy	Did they die or what?
qy	are they going to come back in the spring?
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
qy	Those flowers, remember those little ones you gave me?
sd	well, I know they were still blooming up until about a few weeks ago.
ny	Yeah.
sv	they, They're really pretty.
b	Yeah
qy^t	I mean isn't it supposed to be five minutes?
qy^g	We didn't disconnect, did we ?
sd	Boy, I hate to think I hate to think I'd be talking to you without getting paid .
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
sd	and that was it.
bh	Really?
bh	really ?
b	Yeah.
h	I don't know,
sv	Well, there isn't really much to talk about as far as lawn and garden goes.
sd^m	Not for me either.
sd	and that's about it.
qw	What do I do with it?
qy	are they going to tell us to stop or what ?
qy	Isn't it five minutes?
sd	I mean, I'm all talked out about gardens.
qy^d	it's just suggested?
br	What?
co	We could talk, Let's talk about the baby.
o	Okay,
qy^d	The U S involvement in there, then I guess even though.
h	I don't know.
sv	I think that's true because of all the support that came through.
sd	and of course on the news I try to listen and also read between the lines you know .
sd	like so much of the business and the rebuilding in Kuwait and things like that will go to American businesses where as before they may be dealt with Japanese firms or other people.
sv	like the first priority ought to go to American businesses, you know which will be good for our economy.
sv	I mean we don't seem to slow down even when there is a crisis .
sv	Your oil companies, they may see, probably the first big rise in business they have seen in years.
aa	Uh huh.
aa	I do too.
^q	I want what everybody has.
sv	it's like you see two little pre school kids fighting over a toy, you know.
sd	I know they are putting President Bush right now in an awkward position concerning the, The treaty over there right now.
sd	but, you know the cease fire,
sd	I'm trying to say another, because he yeah. You know because he wants them to uphold their end of the deal as far as the cease fire
sv(^q)@	but at the same time, he's not wanting to go in and say, Okay, I'm going to fight your war for you, which I think is right. / * should be 2 slash units, with final clause getting sv code
sv	we're not the judge and jury.
sv(^q)	but I know that that's causing him a little bit of unpopularity with the people over there because they feel like, Gee, you told us, to stand up against him, but you're not helping.
sv	and I think we ought to help, you know.
sv	and, so I think he's done good on that stance.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
b^r	yeah.
sd	Well, he may have
sv	you have to have people who believe in your cause.
sd	You know, I know they tried to turn it into a holy war, because to them that is what's honorable. You know, if you die in a holy cause,
sv	but I think they are smart enough, to see there's nothing holy about it.
sv	We just want to go in and took it.
b	Sure.
sd	Well, I hope that's true.
sv	I guess in the back of my mind I think like maybe the Israeli Massad probably has ideas of going in and,
sv	You know, I thought they, showed a tremendous restraint in their reactions towards everything,
sv	but I don't believe for a minute that that means that they don't have ideas and plans of their own .
sd	But I do agree with you,
sv	and I think, that's how you have to go into something like that.
o*	And don't you feel? /* listen
b	That's right.
qy	And don't you think that long term that's been a big boost for the United Nations.
sd	I mean the United Nations been there for years, but all of a sudden.
sv	and the fact that when they have sanctions and we support things like this, it means something.
sv	And I think that's good for the strength of the United Nations.
b	Yes.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's true.
sd	They supported it.
sd	That is right,
sd	they did ask that they build up Israel and Kuwait.
sv	And I think they should have to.
sd	They lost .
aa	Well, that's true.
sv	Well I don't think Iran is under the same type of madman type leadership,
h	but there's always the possibility, I guess.
sv	I think so.
sv	I think the person who really may be at this time has a hard road to tow is Jordan's King Hussein because he really kind of, really tried to kind of straddle the fence.
sv	but at the same time, he didn't feel like everybody ought to be going against Iraq.
b	Right.
aa	No.
sv	no matter what situation they see they're going to find their cause whether it truly exists or not.
aa	I know.
sd	But, see you are also getting back to the ages old problem of Arab Israeli conflict, as far as personalties and who is the selected one of God
sd	and theirs tie so much to their religion.
ad	go ahead.
b	Yeah.
sd	I do it every day on a regular basis.
sd	I travel quite a bit in my in my business,
sd	I do it every morning usually after breakfast before I take a shower and get, you know, dressed going you know, to go to work.
sd	so you don't start at this kind of regiment, you know.
sd	but I do twenty five, where you have your arms above your head and and your body twisters touch you know, left and right toe
sd	and I do, ten, right and left, trunk twisters.
sd	And I do, about sixty, bicycle, leg thrust type things.
sd	And I do, twenty, leg lifters on each side. You know when you're p , laying on the floor.
sd	and, then I do about,
sd	now if you did football, like the old grass drills where you're on your stomach and you
sd	and that takes really about, maybe about thirteen minutes, in the morning.
sd	Years ago I used to, referee football
sd	and, to stay in condition, I did that, just as a normal basis,
sd	and then I do about a hundred before supper and about a hundred before I go to bed.
sd	I lost fifteen pounds just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles
sv	within reason, you know, you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical being
sv	I, I think it's really important.
ba	Good.
sv	Well, that's why Chuck, I think, if you did it on a daily basis and you didn't need elaborate things, you know, where you can make excuses like,
sd	and during the summer, I'll do, you know, at least seventy five miles a week and when I really was doing it maybe a hundred and fifty,
sd	there's excuses, weather
sv	But if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning, just like brushing your teeth you're going to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour. And you get up a half hour earlier
sv	and once you start getting into that, you just feel good
sv	and you look a whole lot better.
sd	and there's no way I can get her to.
sv	If you don't like to exercise, you know, it isn't going to happen.
sv	and you know, no sense getting in arguments with anybody, about it.
sd	And, if you get one of these mats. You know, go to a store, they normally have these exercise, things, these A B C s of physical fitness on them.
sd	One of my kids got me one of those for Christmas one year
sd	so you can put it up, you know, just in the corner.
sd^e	you can do that.
ny	yeah.
sd	and it's just about six feet long, rolls up
sd	if I do like sit ups, I'll throw a towel down or something. You know,
qy	did you vote in the last, national election?
ba	that's good.
sd	if I got the last local one.
sv	you're not sure where to go and vote and all that.
sv	or you don't know you know, where they stand or anything like that.
sv	I think you're right.
sv	or sometimes they don't like either of the choices for the candidates,
sv(^q)	so they think, well, you know, why vote.
sv	especially in Texas .
aa	yeah.
b	Yeah
b	Yeah.
sv	It also seems like maybe another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if, you know, not enough people are voting.
sd	it's kind of like in Louisiana where that, guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan member something got elected.
sv	Kind of scary when you think about that.
ba	gosh.
sv(^q)	people will sit home and assume, that guy would never get elected.
sv	Next thing you know, you've got him.
b	Yeah.
b	Right, yeah.
na	Right.
sd	he sure did.
sv	I think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days, or you could mail it in, or something like, if you have real strict work hours, and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long
sv	I think that discourages a lot of people.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I would be tempted to do it again.
b	Right.
sv	I think they should change the whole system so that it's easier
sv	I think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle.
b	Uh huh,
sd	A lot of times I'll vote a straight party ticket just because I don't take the time to find out you know, other than the major candidates, what they stand for on what issues,
sd	so I'll just trust well, the party kind of goes along these lines so I'll go ahead and vote.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I guess it'd be best if you knew each person and what they stood for and why and everything.
sv	and try to determine if what you read was objective or not.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think it could affect the outcome, you know, could make it unfair.
b	yeah.
sv	the press has a lot of power.
sv	you'd really open a can of worms.
sv	and I don't think they ever care to.
fc	Well, it was good talking to you.
fc	Bye.
sd	I guess, I'll just start by saying that we entertain with, a gourmet club here. which means that we have like eight people, four couples.
sd	most of the husbands cook.
sd	but it was the guys that got together and did all this.
sv	I think it's caveman,
sv	and it's a good thing because, you know, you can't knock that.
sv	And it's really, really kind of a neat thing to do.
sd	It's like, you know, if we can do it once every six months, we're doing well .
sd	So, I mean we originally started out, you know, when we were younger and didn't have so much stuff going on with the kids.
sd	then we tried to do it every other month,
sd	but lately it's just been once every six months .
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
b^r	really .
aa	it is absolutely.
b	Yeah .
sd	so I mean he can get within,
ba	my.
b	yeah.
sd	it makes you, keep looking for recipes every time you have an eye out, for something like,
sd	but that's basically what we do is the gourmet,
sd	so, you know, they would be pretty elaborate.
sd	I mean it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff,
sd	and, you know, you get all prepared
sv	it really is.
sv	I just, think it's neat.
sd	I just love sharing meals and, and whatever you can do, you know, to do that.
sd	I don't think you have to be, you know, more than hamburgers and hot dogs out, in the backyard and the, and the coleslaw and potato salad.
b	Oh.
qw	What are you providing ?
ba	There you go.
sd	We're all not built like, what, Martha Stewart, you know.
sd	We all aren't Martha Stewart and have our coordinated glasses and tablecloths and, and time to, you know, t ,
h	I don't know .
sd	I mean I love to make things from scratch, you know. Making breads
sv	and you know people really pretty much appreciate it.
aa	I think so.
b	Oh.
b^r	Oh.
b^r	Oh.
ba	There you go.
b	Oh.
sd	I mean, we have bakeries around here that, you know, you just gain weight going by the door, you know, just like that.
sv	I guess some of the best things I've ever had, some of them were just hors d'oeuvres, you know.
sd	Doing little hors d'oeuvre things that, I have a kick making that, I mean, you know .
sd	But gee, we have so much going on here because you know this is Dallas,
sd	this is, you know, chips and Picante sauce and anything hot.
sd	You know you can always make it hotter, and lots of stuff like that, you know,
sv	so. That's, a really good party time, eating all that hot food
sv	and they just love it, you know, down here.
sd	all the stuff that goes with that,
sd	I'm from Chicago.
sd	and how, I got to Texas by way, of Virginia and everything is a long story.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	so you're into microwave cooking.
sd	something that we can just cook in a hurry after we get off work.
sd	I've gotten in the habit of cooking something big on the weekends so that I have leftovers all week.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It's just my husband and I, too
sd	and I try not to make so much that it lasts more than that week
sd	but, I usually, I usually like to make spaghetti or soup or chili or, you know, something like that or sometimes a roast,
qw	What's your favorite thing to cook if you're having a dinner party?
b	oh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	that sounds delicious.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I end up with an old stand by that we call Russian chicken, because it's so easy
sd	and that's about it, you know.
sd	and then you take and make a dressing out of, Russian dressing, one bottle of that and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix and three ounces of apricot preserves
sd	and then I cover the pan with foil and put it in the oven for about an hour
sd	and then I take the foil off and let it brown takes about another twenty minutes
sv	and it's delicious
sd	and by the time I've got everything else ready, the chicken's done.
sd	So that's a real easy thing for me.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really.
sd	my mom gets that,
b	Really.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I have not done that well with.
sd	I have had a recipe that someone has given me that it's kind of like you just mix cream cheese and stuff and refrigerate it, you know
sv	but that's not the same as a New York style cheese cake.
sv	and it's really not very good
sv	I bet that lemon and orange peel gives it a little bit of tartness.
sd	so there's your good dessert for your dinner party.
qy	Are you into serving wines with your dinner party?
sd	I wish I knew more about it.
b	Uh huh.
sv	They would be, if you just had time to do it.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, I didn't even know they were offering that.
sv	well, I bet that would be a fun thing to do.
fp	Hello.
fp	Hello,
sd	it took forever to find somebody.
qy^d	and I guess we have to, talk about credit cards.
qy^d	well, if you're ready, then
sv	So. I think they're kind of dangerous.
b	Uh huh.
sd	me too.
sv	they're really trying to get you into that situation, because they know they've really got you then,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I mean, I think like half the amount that they cost in the first place.
sv	and now that's real irritating.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It was only a thousand dollars that we needed for the truck.
sd	You never miss one or whatever
sd	and so we charged them all up again.
sv	It's so alluring, and so easy to get,
b^r	yeah,
sd	and she was eating a cupcake and now her crumbs all over.
sd	and I just thought, you know, if we ever had something go wrong with our refrigerator or something, you know and we had to buy one, then we would really need that,
sd	and then we weren't smart enough to not use it,
sd	and, I'm, not for gun control, in the strictest sense of the, word.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	only outlaws will have guns then.
sv	And I believe that too because the person that is wanting to, commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gu , a gun, a knife, a rock, a stick, whatever it is, to commit a crime with,
sv	but there's an element that can't.
sv	They have got them outgunned.
sd	It had, held like a fifteen shot clip, which, they would be able to put down anything that came at them,
sv	but you figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an Uzi machine gun, a thirty eight,
sv	Smith and Wesson revolver isn't going to do you much good.
sd	you didn't have to list your guns,
sd	this was twenty years ago.
sd	But they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit in that respect.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	You had to fill out an application and, go down to the sheriff's office and get fingerprinted
sd	and, then } you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing.
sv	I think that, you know, a waiting period, can make a difference
sv	but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that.
sv	So there's, I don't, think there's any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is concerned because,
aa^r	right.
sv	we're getting into capital punishment now .
aa	But I agree with you there that,
sv	the, again the purpose of gun control is to control how it is being used is what the purpose should be.
sv	It's not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose, legal purpose but to keep the guy that's illegal from getting his hands on one.
sv	but, the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized because there is the criminal element.
aa	yes.
b	Yeah.
sv	You don't have to carry one in your car or your, or your pocket all the time.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	My wife the same thing, she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have not that I have an arsenal or anything,
sv	one of these days my grandkids probably.
sv	but, still I think they ought to know how to use one and that it's not just a toy and that it's not like on T V when someone gets shot, they get back up.
sv	If someone gets shot with a, real gun they don't get back up.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and he took me out with him and, single shot twenty two, and taught me how to shoot.
sd	and, and, he taught me how to shoot, a old single shot twenty two
sd	and, I was probably about twelve at the time,
sd	and, of course Uncle Sam took me hunting with him
sd	and he let me shoot and showed me how.
b	Right.
sv	we agreed pretty well on this I think.
fc	Well it's been real nice talking with you.
fc	bye.
qy	Do you go camping very much?
sd	we try to go once, maybe twice a summer. just, you know, for like a short weekend or something.
sd	We don't go for you know, week long thing.
sd	But we usually go to, a lake area, you know, where the campsites, are and do that.
sd^e	a tent.
sv	You're really roughing it.
b	Yeah.
qy	I mean?
sd	I'm in Garland.
sd	Right outside of Dallas.
sd	and she was pretty young when we started, camping with her.
aa	I know.
sv	and they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like, that to play with.
sv	It's pretty fun.
b	Yeah.
sd	we try to, go with another couple that have children also.
sd	we kind of split it up.
sv	Because it really does get expensive if you don't want to rough it all the way.
sd	and, and so we've built that up.
nn	No.
qy	Do you?
bk	Oh.
sd	I would too.
sd	And, so we'll go to a lake where they can go do that.
sd	and the girls can play on the beach area .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
ba	That's fun.
qy	Am I pretty Texan?
sv	you don't sound like it to me.
bh	have you?
b	Yeah.
sv	I have, I guess more of a twang, to my voice .
na	I sure am.
sd	I've lived here all my life.
sd^e	we went last summer, actually.
sd	we did like, we drove down to Houston to visit friends,
sd(^q)	And I said, Well, I'd love that
sd	and ever once, you know, on you know, my week long vacation, I, want to be a little bit pampered, you know, by a, hotel and a waiter .
qy^d	I don't know if you have ever heard of it?
sd	And, it has like dinosaur tracks, and stuff like that
sd	So we're going to try to do that like on a three day weekend, go there
sd^e	I haven't.
qw	Where at?
bh	Is it?
b	and, you know,
sd	But I would love to camp, in the mountains.
sd	she loves that place.
sd	She says that where we need to go sometime.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd	I love that.
ba	That's neat.
sd	I used to go camping all the time as a Girl Scout.
sd	All the time. I got real used to it then.
sd	I felt like we roughed it then .
aa	Exactly.
sd	I mean, we had to make the fires and dig latrines and everything.
sv	You have to get poison ivy and all that good stuff, to really be camping .
qy	Well do you, you say you haven't been in years?
ba	gosh, bless your heart.
b	Yes.
b^r	uh huh.
ba	I don't blame you.
ba^r	I don't blame you at all.
sv	Years ago it would have been fine
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I kn ,
ba	I can imagine.
ba	I don't blame you, not nowadays.
ba	Good.
bk	Okay.
ba	that's neat.
qy^g	It's hard isn't it?
qw	Now, how old are your girls?
ba	goodness.
sv^r	You're not old at all.
aa	Sure.
qy	Do you need to go?
ba	That's very smart.
qw	How many have you made so far, calls?
qw	How many have you had so far, do you know?
ba	that's good.
ba	Very good.
b	Yes.
ba^r	you bet.
sd	I always try to find out where they're from, you know,
sv	because it is neat.
sv	It really is.
fc	Well then, I guess I'll let you go so you can go get the door
fc	me too.
fc	Thank you.
fc	Bye bye.
qo	well what do you think?
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's true.
aa	That's true.
aa	Right.
aa	That's true, I think,
sv	they are going to get a gun no matter what.
sv	I think they're going to go out and find it someway, individual sale or something like that.
aa	That's true.
sv	I just think it makes honest people more honest
sv	And, if you have to have it in a hurry, something's wrong .
aa^r	That's right.
sd	so we talk about this a lot .
sd^e	I was watching a,
^2	worried about that.
aa^r	They do.
b	Right.
sv	or even the little toy guns look real.
sv	and that's kind of scary to think that you may be shot for holding one.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It looks like they've got a weapon.
aa	That's right,
aa	Exactly.
sv	and I think, that's a good idea.
aa	That's right.
aa	I know.
b^r	right.
sv	A gun is a gun to them.
aa	That's exactly right.
aa	Exactly.
sd	and, and they encourage it.
sd	and, So, it was quite unusual to see the people in that town.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Exactly.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	That's what we're doing.
b	yeah.
b	Oh.
ba	Well, that's neat.
ba	Well, that's real neat.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
ba	Well, that's real good.
sv	And they usually are real basic, common sense things.
sv	and people don't want to believe that.
b	Yeah,
b^m@	In the chamber . That's exactly right.
sd	She knows real well about her Daddy's guns, what not to do and what to do around them.
sd(^q)	she'll even tell her friends, don't ever, touch my Daddy's guns or something like that.
sd	and he'll tell how he's doing it or, you know, show her the insides or stuff like that.
^2	to be feared
aa	exactly.
sv	they'd have that respect for what it does, and what it can do.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
b^m	still .
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
^q	hold on ,
^q	I know he is.
sd	but, boy if someone did break in, I don't know that I could or would even grab it .
b	Yeah.
b	Yes,
b	Right.
sd	well we have dogs that are you know, very protective, you know .
sv	if they're stupid enough to come through then .
sv	and most people that, break in or whatever, go to houses without the dogs, luckily.
sv	And, that's one of them
fc	Well, do you think we've,
fc	Me too, on gun control.
fc	I think we are.
fc	I'm glad you're not .
fc	Well good!
fc	Bye bye.
sd	so football, I love this.
sv	but they seem to be doing pretty good this year.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
qy	Well, they haven't, have they just lost one game this year?
bk^m	Two.
sv	People are pretty surprised that I mean they beat the Giants.
ba	I bet .
qy^d	boy, I bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it .
b	Yep.
sd	And I think I was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on Sundays.
sd	I couldn't see him until like Tuesday because MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, if I didn't, like football.
aa	Yep.
aa^r	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	We're not convinced that we're going to be Cowboy fans yet.
sd	Well, I guess we'll first have to get to used to the idea that we're staying here .
sd	That's even harder.
sd	and he just got transferred here to E Systems,
sd	And here, yeah you've just got to drive down to the stadium
aa	Yes.
sd	Well, he's from here.
b@	So, Yeah .
sd	That's what I hear.
sv	Which is rare.
sd	They take popular songs and change them to fit, the Broncos and stuff.
sd	They did Johnny Elway to that.
sv	I think football is kind of a sport that I think you kind of, it's hard not to like it.
sv	It's exciting.
b	Yeah.
sd	This interstate seventy five song. Or whatever it was about Central Expressway and getting it done in nineteen ninety five and everything.
sd^t	the topic was, should the United States adopt the metric system, and if so, should,
b^m	And why didn't it work last time? .
sv	I wish, it had started a long time ago, is the problem, because we're so wound up in the in the system that we've got that, you know, trying to convert over,
sd	and I guess, they tried what'd the call it, soft conversion and hard conversion
sd	and you give it some sort of a weird metric number like six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter.
h	I don't know.
qy^d	Well doesn't just about everything now have both metric and English.
aa^r	yeah.
sd	I believe it was Exxon
sd(^q)	So they could put this sign out front that said, you know, thirty nine cents a liter.
sd	And nobody had any idea what a liter was,
sv	so you can figure out what you're actually paying for it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sv	when you learn one from the other, you always end up in this conversion thing all the time.
sv(^q)	but, you know, it's like somebody said, okay as of such and such a date, you know, anybody caught talking in the English, you know, will be shot or something like that, you know.
sd	I read that, what Uganda and,
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	course you're familiar with any drawing system you end up with things in inches in parts of inches, you know, half, fourth, you know, this sort of thing.
sd	And then you end up with a decimal, where you start getting into mils, and that sort of thing.
sd	And then some of them are done in, you know, purely metric.
b	Uh huh.
qy	have you ever lived in a country where they use metric.
sd(^q)	You know, if you start talking about miles, they'd look at you like, what.
sd	it's in a can that's taller but not as big around.
sd	and temperature is the big thing the Centigrade for which she says Celsius.
sv	if it's between twenty and thirty it's pretty warm,
sv	You know, you don't get all the little differences
sd	but the difference thirty and thirty five degrees is, quite a bit.
sd	five .
aa	something like that.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	they're on metric, aren't they?
sd	And this thing was even different than, you know, S A E standards and stuff.
sd	it was Austin motors engine and running gear.
sd	and, it was a total mess.
sd	so. It's just crazy.
b	Yeah.
sd	I thought maybe they would convert to, metric back when they went to the fifty five mile an hour speed limit, because what is it fifty six or fifty seven's qua , a hundred kilometers,
aa	you'd have people going, you're right, a hundred miles an hour.
sv	That'd sure seems like a long way.
aa	I guess that's it.
sv	they could've converted it to metric just about as easy.
b	Yeah.
^2	Not all that common.
sd	And you got to know where you are because anything that was the old canal zone is going to be miles per hour,
qw	What are you afraid of with them?
ny	Yes.
aa	Well, that's can be very, very true.
sv	They figure that, if they give you card, at no charge for a whole year that you will use it
sv	Well, the other thing, of course, is the fact that they hope, you will not pay your bill at the end of the month, so that you would be paying interest.
sd	I use mine a great deal, for groceries, for everything that I can and, then just write one check at the end of the month, for the entire thing,
bf	Sounds like you have a little one there.
bh	you have.
qw	How old are they?
sv	boy. Those are two very active ages .
qy	Well, do you ever use the A T M machines?
sv	Well, I find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks, in order to get cash.
b	Right.
sv	Well the other thing some people are not aware of, is they will use their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash
sv	and when they do that, they begin paying interest right from that very day on.
aa	Absolutely.
sv	Because they, they figure that, that's correct .
sv	The idea is to use their money .
sv	And, during that whole month and, then pay it at the end of the month.
sv	Well, I think that's the only thing you can do, is just say no and mean no and, not be tempted.
sv	That's their favorite word.
sv	Well, it's interesting, that, people have generally the same view. of credit cards, no matter where you go.
b	Right.
sv	Well, and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own,
sv	and, I mean, that does nothing, but exacerbate the entire problem.
ba	That's right.
fc	Take care of your little ones.
fc	Uh huh.
sd	it's a little Tercel .
sd	so I got him to take the alternator off and take it and, you know, get a replacement part.
sd	and it blew out all the fuses.
b	Yeah.
sd	I bel , something like sixty nine dollars, something on that order.
qy^d	I don't know if you have them in your area
sd	but there's just some little difference that, causes it not to work an i ,
sd	and that was my last experience.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Goodness,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	so I really can't complain about this one.
sd	it was a seventy mile trip everyday, you know, two ways was seventy miles.
sd^e	it was just seventy miles.
aa	Yeah.
sd	but still I drive a long ways.
sv	But I guess because they're highway miles, you know, it's not so bad on your car as if it, you know, were just regular street, you know.
sd^e	I do.
qy	Do you?
b	Uh huh.
sd	it's the same number that you call to make a call.
ad	and you can leave a message.
sd	and they'll call you back.
b	really.
b	Uh huh.
sd	let's see before I had this car I bought an Audi five thousand
sd	so the engine never got put back together again.
sv	I think those old cars might be a pretty good bet because you ,
h	I don't know, i ,
b	 Uh huh,
sd	I read a book one time that said that the best cars were made before seventy four.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I just don't know how much they'll want to charge me to,
o	Here goes Sharon.
sd	That's the only thing I found out tonight .
ny	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, isn't it funny how baseball's getting less than like football players would.
qy^g	And a lot more games, right?
b	Uh huh.
sv	I mean, I know Yankees have won a lot games . through the years.
sd	I tried to call earlier,
sd	and I don't even know where I even put that paper .
sd^e	I was just cleaning and throwing,
qy	Well, have you ever played baseball?
sd	Well, that's what I did when I was growing up.
sv	That was fun.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you ever go see the Rangers?
sd	I like just looking at the billboards.
sv	it's nice at night.
sd	That's when I've been.
nn	No.
qy	what was, no, wait about the liquor?
b	yeah,
sv	Well, they're trying.
b	Uh huh .
b	right.
sd^c	That's my kids turning on their music.
sd	I think it's the Bart man, the Simpsons .
sd	I wish I could .
sd	I'm in Garland.
sd^e	my husband teaches in Plano.
sd	C V A E.
sd	but I teach for Dallas.
sd	I'm trying to get out.
ny	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	and then they throw it out, and get something else, you know,
sv	and you get tired of that.
b	Yeah.
sv	they don't have as much money.
sv	Most of the time.
sd	there's so many of them .
sd	and you don't know what they're there for, you know, when they're coming, how long they're going to be,
sd	and they're writing the whole time .
sd(^q)	and I finally just got to where I go, okay, I'm Debbie Moore, you know, may I ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for, you know.
sd	Because, you know, you never know where they are going what they'll report
sd	and you hope they're telling you the truth.
nn	huh uh.
aa	it is.
sd	this is my eleventh year.
sd	now my job's good, much better than a lot, because I'm Chapter One,
sd	and all I do is teach reading all day long,
sd	and it's just ten children at a time.
sd	and you've got a lot of federal money, too.
qy^h	Teaching? .
ny	yes.
^q	We don't even know where one is.
sd(^q)	And so I go, okay, I mean, you just, did , what you wanted to do,
sd	and now they tell you what to teach and how long and, you know, what day, what period.
sd	I know which is worse.
b	Uh huh.
sd^t	but you don't have to.
^q	and please say good bye within the next five seconds.
sd	Well, you know, I hadn't either till last night, I was talking to this retired administrator from Cleveland, Ohio,
sd	and we started talking about gangs, you know.
ny	Yeah.
sd	And, everybody else that I've talked to has been right around here.
qy	have you taken any incoming calls?
sd	and it went over ten minutes.
sd	but the topic was boring I thought.
qw	What would you serve, if you were having a dinner party?
sd	I could go on and on about that.
ba	Ugh, neat.
nn	No.
sd	The last one I saw was DANCES WITH THE WOLVES.
sd	I enjoyed it.
sv	I mean, it was just more for my money.
aa	Uh huh.
sd	and one is eleven.
sd	They usually pick their own.
sd	You know, they've got it all figured out.
nd	Well, and Ninja Turtles.
sd	But most of the time really we watch them on the video.
qy^d	Just massive rental.
aa	I know.
sd	That's what we do, especially when it's bad weather, man, just, plug it in.
sv	and nobody has got them yet.
ba	Unbelievable .
b	Uh huh.
qy	Do you read?
bh	No?
sd	See I do that to make myself go to sleep at night.
qy^g	You saw FIELD OF DREAMS, right, a long time ago?
sd	and it's called SHOELESS JOE.
sd	and that's been real good.
no	don't ask me .
sd	The GHOST OF SHOELESS JOE was the name of the book.
ny	Yes,
sd	But, you know, in the movie the guy was black,
sd	There really wasn't a lot of difference.
qy	Well, do you think we covered baseball?
b	yeah.
sd	and, my kids go to parochial school.
sv	and you can influence the way things are.
sv	The immediacy just isn't there.
sv	people are, reluctant to pass, school tax levies even, when the money is needed or would be well spent because they don't have kids in the schools.
sv	and there's an immediate problem.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think the principal was, education for civic participation.
sv	and you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes.
sv	I mean and I think that one,
sd	And, that's why I guess I'm sort of, reluctantly, in favor of these, choice programs.
sd	And I guess to do that I'd probably have to take it at home.
sd	I enjoy the beach.
b^m	Antibeach.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I prefer a swimming pool .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I can understand that.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That would be nice.
sd	and I really enjoyed that.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've never been up to the Yellowstone area.
aa	You got that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, you have a lot of vacation areas you can go to then.
b	Right.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I feel like it would be confining.
sd	You know I would much rather get on a plane and get there and then enjoy myself.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Because, you know, I think that they have it all over there in just a few tiny, two miles.
sd	and it's all right there.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Right.
ad	I'll let you start this time.
nd	Well, even though it's totally out of my degree training, I've been working as, in the horticultural aspect, so the last, I don't know, fifteen, twenty years, so I'm,
sd	Well, I work for the state as a grounds keeper.
sd	I guess, growing up on the farm and that, I've always had a big interest,
sd	when I have an area to do, I always had a big garden and enjoy working on lawns and everything.
b	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's terrible.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
sv	I think the Saint Augustine and, Centipede grass is another one you have quite a bit of down there
sv	those two.
b	Yeah.
b@	 Yeah.
sd	and, you know, they just grow rocks
sd	it was raining continuously.
sv	And then, I know with all that moisture, a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems.
qy	are you, able to get, sometimes a double crops of certain things in your garden?
ad	Why don't you start?
qr	Things you already owned or things that you've picked up just to do that?
qr	Are they things you already owned or you pick them up just to do that refinishing?
sd	I've done both .
sd	I guess that we've been fairly successful with those.
sv	that's a kind of low risk sort of project, isn't it I guess.
sd	I have a, really nice desk. A nicer desk than I could afford. Which I got because my sister who worked in a hospital, liberated it after a fire
sd	and it turned out to be a nice desk. Maple top I think or something of that sort.
bh	really?
ba	I'm jealous.
sd	I've built my own deck and, things like that.
sd	I, I picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive
sd	But I can't say I use them very often .
sd	and that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel .
sd	But I've also used them where you, for rabbeting because, rabbeting on my, radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain .
sd	and now I use it twice a year maybe .
br	The ones that what?
sd	the little use that I've gotten from my router, I would say, I would spend my money on the bits .
sd	I have I'd guess you'd call a medium quality Craftsman router
sv	any time you buy a tool with a, a, as a, as a package the bits that they give you are low end.
sv	So. That's a thing to consider is to,
sd	Especially, I did some cabinets in, ash and oak
sd	We remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets, which had been in the original, remodeling of our kitchen.
sv	And, routing hardwood will, take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast .
b	Right.
qy^g	And then you take the blade to the to get sharpened, right .
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sd	and now all my blades need sharpening. Because, treated wood will also chew them up.
qo	so, Jack, what type of music do you like?
sd	I never really had listened to it till I got married,
sd	and my wife, enjoys it.
sd	And even every once in a while I put it on myself, you know.
sd	I like those.
sd	Though I couldn't tell you anything about them other than when my wife says, This is Bach, you know.
qo	How about popular music?
b	 Yeah.
sv(^q)	You know, people always say, Wow! the meanings of those words.
sd	I just thought they just all sort of rhymed, you know.
sv	That, whenever they say it two or three times.
sd	I, I commute back and forth between Baltimore and a rural town called Salisbury, which is two and a half hours away,
sd	and the difference in the radio with popular music, is totally different, you know,
sd^e	because Baltimore will play more, what might be considered a little bit more progressive?
sd	And as soon as you go down to Salisbury, this town that's, you know, two and a half hours away in the suburbs or whatever, in a real rural Maryland, it turns into basically classic rock.
sd^e	mostly oldies.
sd	you know, like when the Doors movie came out, you know, Doors was really on the radio there, you know. Where, you know, you'd hear one or two of their more famous songs, maybe top forty in Baltimore,
sd(^q)	but in Salisbury, that's all you would hear was, This is the Doors!, you know.
sd	So, it was sort of a funny thing.
aa	but there is.
sd	and I never really noticed the difference when I moved to this area?
sd	It just seemed the same.
sd	But when I went more rural, you know, it really changed.
bh	does it?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Boy, that would really be beneficial.
sd	I never get it.
sv	You know, and if you don't read the paper, you sort of fall behind if you're in, the car all the time.
ba	that's pretty good.
b	Uh huh.
sd	On fact, my grandmother does that a lot, because she's blind,
sd	or she's losing her sight or whatever.
sd	I can imagine, you know, if you're driving cross country, you know, listening to a story.
sv	lot of the classics are really, on tape.
b	Yeah.
ba	that would be good.
sv^t	Well, we strayed a lot from music.
sv	but I guess music comes into that whole aspect of listening. So as long you're listening.
fc	Well, Jack, it was nice to talk to you.
fc	and I hope you get some more calls and make some more calls.
fc	Bye.
qo	What kind of lawn and garden work do you do? .
qy	you've been working on it for three years?
qw	What have you done? .
b	Uh huh .
sd^c	You know, I can barely hear you .
sd^e	a little bit, yeah .
b	Uh huh.
qw	How did you get rid of them?
br	Pardon?
bk^m	Dursban Two,
qy	so you haven't had a problem with that, since?
b	Yeah.
qy^d	Not really.
sd	and we're just not real into the lawn probably because we're renting, I guess,
ny	Uh huh.
qw	What?
qw	I wonder why it does?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	do you enjoy doing it?
qy	Do you have a garden?
b	Uh huh.
qw	Where do you all live?
b	really,
br	Southwest where?
fc	and, do you have anything else you wanted to say?
fc	and we'll talk to you later.
qy	Martin, do you do any exercise?
qw	How's the weather out there in Georgia?
b	Uh huh.
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'm riding my Aerodyne bike, half an hour every morning,
sd	It's it's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and, has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise.
sd	and then I'd really like to get into that.
sd	It's it's really fun.
aa	uh huh.
b	Yes.
qy	Have you done that?
b	Oh.
bh	That's the big thing,
qw	So how is that?
bk	Oh.
b	Yeah.
qy	do you have healthy knees?
ba	dear .
b	Uh huh.
sd	He he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball,
sd	and, he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy.
sd	he wears his brace and his high tops
b	Oh, .
ba	dear.
sd	It is amazing how fast you take off the inches
sd	and then, every other day I'd like to incorporate the video, and then the bike on the other day.
sd	and the muscle builds real fast.
sd	and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells, and then build up to your, twenty five pound dumbbells
sd	and it's a hour long video,
sd	so I'm looking forward to losing this weight and being firm and healthy .
qo	what sort of camping do you like to do the most?
bh	rough type, ?
sv	motor homes can be a lot of fun.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well, so far my wife and I have pretty much had to stick with tent camping.
sd	This summer we went to, the Smokey Mountain National Park. And, stayed about three or four days in there.
sd	It was wonderful.
sd	and, it was beautiful, beautiful few days.
sd	It worked out particularly well, especially considering she was, what, six months pregnant.
sd	It was one of those, dome type pop up tents.
sv	Nice and quick and easy to put up.
sv	and, about had to be something like that getting around in a Pinto.
sd	It was a lot of fun.
bh	yeah?
qy^d	that's got to be beautiful territory.
qy	What, like, Sequoia National Park?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
 qy	Do they still have the scenic, roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees?
bk	Okay.
sd^e	so far, New Orleans is far west as I've gotten. Well, New Orleans and, Minneapolis.
aa	yeah.
sd	We're hoping one of these days soon after we're out of school to head that way.
aa	Yeah.
sv	They seem to be trailing out quickly.
b	Yes.
ba	I imagine.
ba	I would imagine they are.
b	Yeah.
qy^g	not a whole lot of forestry down there, is there?
bk	Oh.
sv	Place is forested with those concrete trees.
qo	Anyway, what do you figure has been the longest trip you've taken camping?
b^m	Three weeks.
qy	the whole family, then, was in on this?
b	Yeah.
qy^d	That would have to be a blast.
qy	well, you went out from Texas up into that area?
b	Yeah.
qy^g	Big Sur Highway, that's, where you're pretty much in view of the ocean almost all the time aren't you?
sd	It's the first time I've made a phone call on it.
na	Right.
sd	I read, a lot of Steven King, Dean R Koontz, some Danielle Steel.
sd	My aunt got me hooked on those .
sd^e	they're all novels.
sd	I'll read some, classic, too.
sd	like THE GRADUATE by Steinbeck.
sd	A ROSE FAMILY by Faulkner. That's one of my favorites.
sd	and I read the book from that.
sd	I'm from North Carolina .
qw	What kind of books do you like to read?
sd	I really have to be in the mood.
sd	I read one, like maybe once a year.
sd	I've never read anything by him.
b	Yeah.
b	Okay.
sd	I like to read a lot of non fiction history when Civil War era and that kind of thing.
sd	And that was on T V.
sd	It was, during Teddy Roosevelt's time. And, about a American woman that got kidnapped in, Morocco.
sd	this is when they were having their revolution or whatever
sd	and Teddy Roosevelt sent troops over and really portrays him as a, kind of a crazy man, you know.
sd	I had no idea that he was like that.
sd	and it should be a grizzly bear because
sd	and that's what made me want to read the book.
sd	I'm a real big fan of hers
sd	I like to read some of the philosophy stuff.
b	Yeah,
sd^r	I'm fascinated by that.
sd	and, even stuff about, not like ghost stories, but real encounters with ghosts and supposedly haunted houses.
sd	Some of it really freaks me out .
sd	I read DIANETICS once I got past all the gibberish on it.
sd	it didn't help me that much .
sv	But, I think once you're set in your ways, you're set in your ways.
sd	and I got the job that I wanted by applying the methods that,
ny	Yeah . .
sd	And we had five.
qo	And how about yourself?
bk	Oh.
sd	but I always just made it a point, you know, to spend about ten minutes with each one of them.
sd	So it was an hour, you know.
sd	But whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever, telling them stories or reading to them.
sd	Six years.
ny	Yeah.
sd	We look back and wonder how we did it.
sd^e	she never did.
ny^r	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well that's plenty though.
sv	Well, you know, with kids you're not going to have a neat house.
sv	And, you know it's tough to find time. espec , especially with both of them working.
ad(^q)	And you just have to set the time and say, okay this is going to be it.
b	Right.
b	Right.
ba	that's good that way too .
sv	Well, they say it, it, all it takes is about five, ten minutes a day.
sd	you know, and as the kids got older I made them, you know, help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too. Or whatever
aa	yeah.
b	And, well, yeah,
sv	Just keep them talking that way.
sd	But, another thing we used to do is have family councils. Every Sunday night.
sd	And we'd take turns being president.
sd	And I always thought we'd get outvoted five to two
sd	but it never worked that way.
sd	Well and we could bring up and we could bring up stuff too.
sd	Boy, we really got to know the kids well.
sd^e	In fact, they were all in, over the weekend for Easter.
sd	Well, we did too.
sd	And I remember the one daughter saying, we had a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree
sd	kind of hit us between the eyes.
sd^e	But that was always good quality time for us.
sd	but if they missed it, they had to abide by the rules.
sd^e	and boy, they'd show up.
sd	And we'd usually take notes
sd	and, you know, the younger kids, or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another.
sd	And they loved it.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	But, boy, I feel for you and your husband.
qo	So, what things do you consider an invasion of privacy?
sd	I started to think about all the big, you know, data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports and all those, you know, demographics studies that they do that, you know, have, who knows, how much, you know, stuff about all the purchases that you've made and everything kept tract somewhere
sv	but I know I mean they sell those,
sd	I mean I know drugs are illegal.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think they should be evaluated that way rather than with you know, a chemical, you know,
qy	These people that are carriers and don't that don't reveal it?
sd	I mean I've heard of things like, you know, you know, marking them somehow you know, or something like that or, you know, putting them all someplace like in a kind of,
sv	Wel , I guess it kind of borders on I mean what do you value more. The invasion of, the person's privacy or the possible danger to, you know, other people.
sv	I guess that's been the big role of government, I guess . I mean generally.
sv	I mean that particular case.
sv	not a huge part but a, you know
sv	the AIDS population I guess that have it, that don't know they do are spreading it.
sd	I don't know how exactly I feel about that.
qy	And you say you have some strong feelings about, the issue?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	They always like to be able to attract the, Einsteins or the Professor Chou
sv	Those are two things that I think are going on. Although I, I don't think the politicians would tell you that.
sv	so they keep allowing, the pressure cooker to let off steam.
sd	But I'm not to sympathetic about, letting large numbers of Haitians in.
b	Yeah.
sv	But yeah. If you let them in a million at a time, you know, it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population. But politically and economically.
sv	I mean it is now with Haitians the way it was with Cubans, twenty years ago.
sv	So there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in.
aa	Sure.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
qo	Well, how do you feel about trial by jury?
qw	In what way?
qr	do you feel they are swayed more toward, are you talking about with criminal or civil suits?
qy	So, do you think that, I mean the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry.
sd	I like the idea of juries of your peers in that you, you get personally more than one person making a decision.
sv	And second of all, you get a wide variety of background
aa	I'd agree with that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	well, what I don't like about, the jury doing the sentencing in that I think it becomes a lot less,
sv	the same crime gets unequal sentences.
sv	I think there is more of an ability you know, you know for selecting two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent
sv	but, I think there would be a large variation in trying to gage the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that measure stick across the board.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Of course a lot of that's also the ability of the defendant to, get a good lawyer.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I agree .
sv	They will admit to you that they don't have the benefit of being able you know, of, of, allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty
sv	it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
o	Okay.
b	Yes.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ba	mercy.
ba	that's too bad.
ba	It really is.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's wonderful.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's wonderful.
ba	That speaks, well of your mother.
qy^d	She had high standards.
b	Yeah.
ba	bless her heart.
^2	Challenges.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
b	Surely.
sd	And I can, relate to that,
sv	I think it's the image that the woman has and, in the world, as, the lesser of the two.
sv	but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to, like it to take.
sv	And, I think we are progressing at a snail's pace,
sv	but we are progressing.
sv	So, that's the main point is that we are going ahead.
sv	And, I think that, in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve.
sv	And, men, a lot of them have, come around and have seen, the error of their ways.
sv	But there are a lot of die hards out there that will never change.
sv	So we have to, face that reality also.
sv	It could be, if they are not sure of themselves.
sv	The one's that, go along with that, they are sure of themselves.
sv	And they know that they can, you know, be on the same level.
sv	And they do not have any, ego, problems that they are fighting.
sv	And, I think that we are going to be, on par with them in salary and in recognition, in the long term.
sd	and what I would like to see happen futuristically, is what we are discussing, is that yes, we each have our, jobs in life, and that we should recognize that. And that we should support each other.
sv	And, I think our problems would be fewer, if we supported each other. And just looked at each other as equals and none lesser, because we are equal.
b	Uh huh.
b@	 Uh huh,
b^r	uh huh.
sv	And if we, men and women, would do as the Bible said, that we would esteem each other higher than ourselves.
qy	Can you picture that?
sv	I mean, if your husband did that to you, and you did that to your husband, you would always be trying to please each other and not yourself.
sv	And, that's really the divine answer, and the right answer .
sv	So, that would be a beautiful relationship.
sv	And I think there are some people that have done that,
sd	and I have seen it.
sv^t	Well, I've been, I have probably had more time than you have to think about this subject ,
sv	I do believe it's a serious problem.
sv	However , there are solutions to it.
sv	we're probably making a comparison against, some European and, s s say, newer republics that, that have very high percentages.
sv(^q)	And then we further complicate it by saying, you know, we will keep the polls open until eight o'clock.
sv	My solution to that is that we hold it on Sundays. As do probably sixty to seventy percent of the European countries now.
na	no they hold it on a, either a Saturday or a Sunday, or at least a day when, a great number of people are not working.
sd	but that is one of my solutions. ...
qy	Have you absentee voted in in Texas?
sv	and it is a fairly complicated process where you have to go pick up the ballot.
sv	but other states you have to register every couple of years. ... Well, to vote, to just vote .
sv	And we're the mobile society,
sv	that is almost a fourteen percent turnover every, you know ,
sv	if it is difficult to register to vote, that would remove your eligibility to vote.
aa	Well maybe that is another factor , the motivational factor.
sd	one of them is WHOSE STARS AND STRIPES NOW?
sd	THE, TRIVIAL PURSUIT OF THE PRESIDENCY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT.
sv	It is the only way that you can use television effectively.
sv	If you don't refute it, as he didn't, there must be some truth to the matter, see .
sv	And indeed his trend started upward.
ad	Well, don't give too much credit to the American public for their motivational ability .
no	well, I don't know.
sv	Everybody seems disappointed ,
sv	but they don't throw the rascal out, their own rascal.
sv	That sounds rather crass, I think, because then you are saying, well, {D y y you know } , in , y y, it could be convoluted in many ways where people would actually, by paying them,
sv	the whole thing just stinks.
sv	but the idea is to get the individual to the polls, a a and we have to make it as easy as possible for him to get to the polls .
qy	you mean the special interest groups?
sv	I mean, but but he's excused from that.
sd	Generally, people, I've read polls now where they've excused him because there was a definite necessity to balance the budget.
sv	he did he did, he promised the best he could.
sv	And being associated with government, he should be held up to the light for that.
sv	And maybe he will.
sv	I think voters are motivated, ...
sd	Well, I don't know if they have higher turnouts overall.
sd	I think England has about a seventy percent, sixty five percent turn out.
sv	I think that we just discovered in, in the Indian elections is one of the greatest greatest and massive things in the world.
sv	just, it got more violent every year.
sd	They went down almost fifty percent in this election before they blew up Ghandi. But, simply because people were so concerned about their inability to, that their vote does not count any way. And the corruption of politics in, in that s s situation there.
sv	th , but, you know, everything is relative to when, you know, we had higher turnouts because at that time we talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter, right?
sv	but before this Voting Rights Act, what we had was a great deal of our population, mainly the blacks in the south and the Hispanics were precluded by, by, , voting laws, from their eligibility to register.
sv	Now everybody is available.
sv	because all the eligible voters
sv	you know, it was skewed by the eligible voters being less than the total population of ...
sd	I just, I mean I haven't studied the statistics well enough to,
sv	I mean, I think in this sort of conversation we can only do our own reaction.
b	Uh huh.
qo	What do you mean?
sd(^q)	I thought, Gee, I haven't taken anything back for a long time.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Of course,
sv	and then you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed
sv	we're a wasteful society, for sure.
sd	and they didn't work worth anything .
sd	all that were taken back in ages.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
^2	It's hard.
ba	wow.
qy^d	and it just pertained to that .
sv	but, But I think, too, a lot of people don't buy their warranties either because they know that when it's that old they're going to buy a new one,
sd	and and that has saved us thousands of dollars, you know, from to mechanic to anything like that
sv	but I think the technology is better.
sv	About quality.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, people aren't willing to pay those prices very often, so, you know, for a handcrafted something,
sv	So, if we get what we deserve .
b	All right.
sd	all young Americans, they did not specify, you know, exactly what young means.
b	Yeah.
aa	two years might be a little too long.
aa	That, that would be the problem. Sure would.
sv	or maybe offer them, you know, some sort of an incentive to do it. you know college credit, you know, something, you know,
sd	I'm not sure what
sv	a super do salary of any kind.
sv	but that kind of takes away from public service.
sv	I'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea.
sd	I'm not either really.
aa	That's right.
aa	That's right.
sv	They need, you , young families, whatever,
sv	they just couldn't, you know, take off to do that.
b	Oh,
aa	uh huh.
sv	It would have to be a lot of, you know, thought given to something like that, I would think.
b	Uh huh.
aa^r	Yeah.
sd	I'm not even really sure at this point in time, you know, what programs are out there.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	like maybe if there was something they could do own, in their own town or city, yeah, and not have to pull up roots and, you know, go somewhere half way around the world, or something.
aa^r	That's true too.
qh	And, you wonder, you know, what kind of quality job would they do, you know, Just sit around for their year,
qh	or would they really, you know, make a contribution of some kind.
sv^r	It's tough.
sv	But, I think, there would have to be a lot more, you know, information, you know, disseminated, before you say, let's do this, you know.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
sv	It really is.
sd	I don't really see the emphasis on things like Peace Corps, like you know, we saw back, I guess, in the Carter administration,
sv	that was a big thing with him.
sv	And, as a matter of fact, I guess Kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing, or was, you know, really interested in things like that.
sd	Like I say, I don't even know what programs are even ongoing now, you know.
sv	Anyway, it's a tough question.
fc	I enjoyed talking to you.
fc	take care.
fc	Bye bye.
o	Okay.
sv	That's a long time.
b	Uh huh.
qy^2	Andrews?
sd	Well, for the past week or two it's been cold and wet
sd	but before that, for most of the year, it's been hot and dry.
sd	I think for about twelve months through September the average temperature has been higher than normal each month. lots of ninety degree days during the summer.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	if you had it early.
sd	I think we usually have a frost in October.
sd	but the last few days it's been pouring most of the day.
sd^e	I've not heard of any particular problems this time.
b	Yes.
sd	then it, then it became winter like, today it's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day.
b	Yeah.
sd	I think it was an especially good winter for fall colors.
ny^r	yeah.
sd^e	we did, for a time.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Been that this year for the trees for the leaves.
qy	If it would came later it would be all right?
qo	so what do you think about the school system?
qw	why did you choose a private school?
qo	Then how does he like it?
qy^d	So he's been there all the time.
qw	How big of a school is it?
sv	A hundred per grade, that's a good size.
sv	I get a little leery of the real small ones that they don't get much interaction with kids
ba	That's good.
b	Uh huh.
sv	so I'm in a little different ballgame.
sv	and, they have to be so careful of the things they do and say.
sd	And, makes me a little nervous that, students don't seem to show that respect
aa	no.
sv	and, course, I guess the teacher used to warrant that
^2	For other people
sv	or this, generation's just kind of changed a little bit,
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	We used to have to wear dresses
sd	and it had to be matching
aa	Yes.
aa	Yes.
sd	They say you kind of act how you're dressed a little bit,
qy	does this school your son goes to, do they, require to wear a uniform
sd	Well, CITY SLICKERS, and STAR TREK FIVE.
ny^r	yeah.
sd	I thought I'd better see that one before I go and see six.
qo	How about yourself?
qw	How is it?
sd	I can't wait.
qy	Now, does the old STAR TREK guys meet the new guys?
qy^d	it's just the old guys still.
sd	You know, that I read in no, it was U S A TODAY
sd	That was it.
qw^d	I'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the old guys was.
qy	He was a doctor still?
qy^g	he didn't look too bad, did he?
qy	But, did they have some pretty good special effects?
sv	the script was bad, bad, bad .
qw	Why?
bh	is that right?
sv	Leonard, Nimoy, he does a lot better.
sd	or, no, JOURNEY HOME, I think that was.
qy	you're a real life Trekkie?
sd	I wouldn't go so far as being a Trekkie,
bh	really?
qy	did you get to talk to him?
sd	It was crowded.
nn	No.
ba	Wow.
sd	They have some good management principals in this NEW GENERATION.
b	Oh.
qy^d	so he kind of was a cowboy type, too.
sv	but, Jean Luke does more of a, committee type of management.
qw	What other movies have you seen?
qw	how was that?
qy^g	Lots of little funny spots,
qy	Did they have Thing
bh	Really?
qw^d	I've always wondered how he gets around.
qy^g	But he's in a box, right?
qy	Didn't he used to?
bk	yeah, that's, okay.
qo	How about you?
qy	Are most of the houses in your area three bedroom, two bath?
aa	Yeah,
sd	So like the den and the living room are all double cathedral ceilings.
sd	You can just spot them because the roof is so much higher.
sd	Well it's like when my son goes up into the furnace area over the garage.
sd	I would say about, about ninety five percent, no I guess probably a hundred percent of them all are mostly brick, with some wood.
sd	But of course they have a little river going down their area too, which is kind of nice .
sd	they've put little fountains in and such.
b	Oh.
qy	Do you have I mean a lot of yard around your house now, in Denton?
sv	They're built practically on top of each other.
sd	I know, I was,
sv	and you've lost your back yard.
sv	But it's great for mowing .
sd	and you've got plenty of room to even play a small game of baseball, but, don't do it around here.
sd	I hadn't thought about it that way.
sd	It was the same problem.
nd	I got layed off by T I .
sd	My ex husband was working downtown.
qy	do you do artistic painting?
bh	you do?
qy	Do you do a lot of it?
sd	and I've done a little,
sv	But it takes a lot of time .
qy	do you sell your projects?
b	Uh huh.
qw	Where do you work at?
qy	Now do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique?
b	Uh huh.
sv	That keeps you busy.
qy	well, do you cut out your own projects?
qrr	or do you brush it on?
b	Uh huh.
sd	I just bought a spray gun, one of those not airless, high volume, low pressure spray guns.
sd	and that's what I bought it for.
sd	But I haven't used it yet.
ny	Yeah.
ny^r	Yeah.
sd	fine furniture.
sd	That's why I bought the sprayer is to finish my projects.
sd	I get so sick of making ,
sd^e	but spraying does put on a nicer finish.
qy^h	For woodworking?
sd	and ts about it.
aa	it is.
qy^d	I don't know if you've ever heard of those.
sv	But it's nice to have the right equipment.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	mostly I do like you do, give it away as gifts.
sd	But, Making my own furniture.
na	just in junior high
sd	and then I just kept on through high school and then got my own equipment, kept up with that.
aa	Yeah.
aa^r	Yeah.
qy^d	Like the shelves and,
qy^d	For your tole painting.
fc	You're probably a veteran at this.
fc	Uh huh.
fc	Yeah.
fc	Where do you buy your tole painting paints at around here?
fc	is it on nineteen hundred?
fc	I know where fifty six hundred south is.
fc	Is that Ben Franklin then ?
ad	Well, tell me about your home.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
ba	It sounds nice.
bh	yeah?
sv	Well, you know, these guys that gambled high lost big you know.
sd	And, I'm insulating myself from that problem.
sd	I'm building my own house.
sd	And as I look out the window of my trailer, I can envision all the insulation that's going up today .
ny	Yeah.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I used to be a builder.
sd	And I retired about five years ago and started college.
sv	There's still no work, you know.
sd	so I did.
sd	And, see the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home.
sd	but you can't borrow the money to build your own.
sd	Well, it's to protect the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home
sd	and then the bank's holding the bag.
sv	as you know, anything that involves the government works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. Right?
sv	Hence the savings and loan problem we have.
sd	It's designed to be added on to.
sd	so I want to have a shop.
sd	Ten acres.
sd	He's on the other side of a hill.
sd	Seriously.
sd	Well, in the winter time, I can see another guy
sd	I can just make out his place, you know. I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north.
sd	Well, I took a lot of time in choosing this site because the house has no heating or air conditioning.
nd	Well, it's got a very small furnace.
sd	And we'll use a wood burning stove as well.
sd	But, in the house itself, I've been working inside, you know, lo , these many months
sd	and I have not had to use the heat.
sd	Because it's all geothermal.
sd	Well, as much as I could get in it, you know. And, the east side is glass.
sd	So it's almost all glass.
sd	I mean, you know. There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows.
sd	it's on the side of a hill.
sd	what I call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
sd	And the side that's on the other side is about six feet high.
sv	So I've got a pretty good grade there.
sd	And then when I put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides that will define the shop.
na	Exactly.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qo	So how do you feel about it?
sd	and a pretty, I don't know, I went through a, standard drug testing thing before I was brought on.
sv	I think it's important to insure the quality and, I don't know, almost the goodness of character. You know that kind of thing.
qw	Where do you work?
bk^r	okay.
ba	great.
b	Right.
sv	but there's always that margin of error.
qh	Like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind, you know, what are they going to do about that .
sd	and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for.
qw	what program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon?
sd	I'm a graduate student at U C F in Florida. University of Central Florida.
sd	But, even for interns they, they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing,
sd	and then, they essentially give you the offer
sd	and then at that point they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that.
sd	I'm actually in a mall calling
qy^g	You probably wondered,
sd	They probably give you a chance to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance to go through it.
qy	are you working right now anywhere
bk	Okay.
sd	A friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there.
sd	And he's doing an internship with I B M.
sd	So, one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process.
sd^e	That's one thing they don't do is drug testing while you're on the job.
sd	but they don't do it.
sd	and while I don't do any drugs myself, I've seen some people who work there, you know, smoking a joint or whatever.
sd^e	they don't really do that.
qy	You think you're getting your money's worth?
sv	Well, that's probably the next year's agenda.
sv	and I, I think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now.
aa	That's right.
aa	that's right.
sd	but I don't think it is anymore, not in Texas anyway.
aa^r	that's right.
sv	but, I think taxes generally are unfair
sv	I think, you know, generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line, which is, you know.
sd	and I don't mean to be knocking,
sv	It's a way of increasing the population, that was one of the initial ideas of, you know, giving exemptions on kids, on federal taxes.
sd	And where you exempt things, like, one of the best things I heard on taxes to stimulate the economy, someone, brilliant deductor, probably Lloyd Bentsen, said that all, you know, if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be, you know, spending more money using their credit cards.
sv	but if you look on all interest things, not just credit cards, but on your cars and, you know, any kind of interest that you're paying, from a personal point of view, that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers.
sv	They quit buying it.
sd	I just sometimes wonder if our money is being used in the best way.
sv	that's, I think is just being thrown away.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	and any time there is a budget cut or crunches, it's always the small guy that gets hurt.
sd	and and sometimes we're running around there.
sd	I really don't know what they do.
sd(^q)	I sometimes wonder, are they really doing anything,
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, they got so many hidden taxes, that it's really hard to figure out how much you are paying, because, go to a grocery store, something like that, and you're paying a little tax here
sv	but there's probably at least about twenty five to thirty cents of different taxes on our gas.
sv	And you don't realize,
b	Yeah.
sv	and that just raises your taxes, you know, they just get it a different way
sd	so, I mean, to me, it did, raise my taxes.
qo	What type of lawn and garden work do you do?
qy	Do you have a garden?
sd	I just have a small plot it's like ten feet by five feet.
b	I see.
sd	it's all the dirt I have, left in my backyard .
sv	It's cheap entertainment.
aa	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Takes a lot of room.
sd	my goodness, what a mistake that was.
sv	it just takes up, you know, like you say, a lot of your garden area.
sd	we just do, tomatoes, bell peppers, radishes and turnips, I mean, not turnips, carrots, beets and things like that.
sd	Well, she just plants a few for herself.
b	Yeah.
bh	Did you really?
sd	we, just wait until, you know, the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground.
sv^e	you can get a head start on it.
aa	I guess it, would,
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well it will make them taste better I'm sure.
^2	You got to inspect it,
b	Sure.
b	Sure.
b	Yeah.
sd	and boy, it is really nice,
sv	it sure beats dragging hoses around.
sd	It's really nice.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I enjoy having a nice looking yard,
sd	I just don't enjoy the work, that it takes to get it done.
sd	I had a lawn service to do my yard for me during the real hot summer months, you know, until I retired
sd	for the last couple of years I've done it myself.
b	Uh huh.
aa	it is.
sv	Of course, the chemicals themselves when you buy them, they're expensive too.
sd	and I screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something.
aa	That's right.
sd	I'm kind of bad about that.
sd	and I really don , you know, don't, want to spend the money for it.
sd	I'm not limited to, just mowing it on Saturday morning, you know,
sd	I can do it on most any day of the week.
b	Yeah.
qy	Is it this weekend?
sv	It's pretty soon.
b	Yeah.
aa	I believe it is too.
sd	I don't use, I seldom use anything harsher than seven dust, you know.
sd	but then, again, I don't want the bugs eating it upping either.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
sv	They really go through it,
b	Yeah.
sv	You know cutworms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too.
b	Uh huh.
sd	so I got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box. And put in a whole bunch like eight hundred pounds of topsoil and manure
sd	and, you know, various other things, Raised it up.
sv	at least they'll have a hard time crawling up the thing.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
sv	You, really do.
sd	I just turned it all up and mixed it all up together with,
sd	I did it by hand,
ny	Uh huh.
sd	It wasn't too much of a job, really.
sv	It would be handy.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	It might be handy,
sd	I've never seen one.
b	yeah.
ba	That would be neat,
sd	We've had a garden, gosh, for years and years and years, of some size, you know,
sd	I can't remember a year when we didn't have one of some kind.
sd	you know tomatoes that are starting to bloom
sd	and I've got some radishes up,
sd	and as a matter of fact, I've already done a second row of radishes.
sd	And, the green onions are coming along.
fa	excuse me.
sd^e	for the first time we planted them this year.
sd	and I couldn't find a nursery that had any of them left.
sd	and, my wife does, a small herb garden on the side.
sd	They're up and doing fine.
b	Yeah.
sv	That's kind of a, let down.
ba	I bet,
aa	we sure do.
sv	One nice thing with onions and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have, you know, too many.
sd	We did that too,
sv	Makes, makes a colorful salad too.
b	Uh huh.
sd	We've tried it, before
sd^e	we haven't had much luck with it we're going to try it again this year.
sd	They have some little buds on them hopefully they'll do something.
sd	We enjoy fooling around with it.
sd	we've got some beets,
sd	We used to do it at home when I was a kid, had a huge garden.
b	Uh huh.
aa	yeah, it does take some space.
b	Yeah.
b	I see.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That will be neat,
b	Uh huh.
sv	they're expensive.
sd	I really, don't know.
ba	That will be interesting.
b	Yeah.
sd^e	I have a daughter.
ny	Yeah.
sd	She's only about, a little less than two years old.
nn	No.
b	Yeah .
sv	I think that's really a decision that,
nd	well, help them make in terms of, you know, what they are wanting to do.
sv	You know, that's a big influence, I think and, You know not only what you can afford, but what's going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are.
sv	So, you know, you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do.
sd	University of Mississippi.
sd	well, well, it was within the state.
sd	But it was not necessarily local, it was,
qy	What's the criterion for choosing to go there?
sd	well, at the time, I was, thinking of going pre med
sd	and in the state, they had the best pre med curriculum for the, state institutions.
sd	It was choice between there and, a private college that, was a bit more expensive.
sd	so I ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me.
sd	I enjoyed it.
nn	No.
sd^e	it was a six hour drive.
sd	it was like another world.
sv	and at that age it's kind of difficult sometimes.
sv	Especially, if you have not been away a lot that extended .
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	that's like, you know, when I went on to get my masters you know, it was where I was at the time.
sd	You know, I was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else because I was pretty much settled
sv	so when you are first going to school you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go.
sd	the computer science center.
sd	north building.
sd	about three years.
sd	actually, I mean I came straight from school to here.
sd	So, cause this was the first real job after getting my degree.
sd	After my masters.
sd	My undergraduate degree was not in what my masters was.
sd	So I made a career change basically.
sd	I like the school where I went.
sd	I mean, and I would not hesitate at all to encourage her to go there there if she wanted to.
sd	Or the school where I got my masters at, which was a different school.
sd	And, I liked it almost as well.
sd	but, you know, that, I'm not going to hold them to that just because I went there.
sv	I, you know, think that's
sd	If they want to, that's fine, but otherwise not. Although I would get quite a break on, on tuition .
sd^e	because they, allow for, tuition, break for out of state students who children of alumnae.
sd	Well certain schools do it.
sd	I was involved in some, alumnae recruiting, here in town, recently, well last year .
sd	and it was kind of fun, because you are to, trying to get people interested in your school, you know.
sd	this was a college night at a high school in Richardson.
sv	There were a hundred schools, probably there all competing for the same kids.
sv	It's kind of interesting to, to talk up, you know, your, school
sd	And, I was surprised by the number of kids that came by and had heard of, you know, our school. and were interested in it.
sv	situations like that, you don't realize, you know, until you start thinking about it, the kinds of advantages you school may have over others.
sd	That worked out so well.
sd	but, it seemed like there were quite a few kids that were definitely interested in going there.
sd	But her, her daughter was, a, ma , dru , a majorette or something. You know, a baton twirler or something
sd	She had cards printed up, actually describing, you know, business cards describing her daughter's, you know, she had won several different twirling awards, and all this,
sv	I think some parents go a little bit overboard.
b	Yes.
sd	and then they just meet at, like, a park or something to have like a short, or a small, dinner type thing.
sd	and we were living in Utah at the time.
sd	and each time they had a reunion they'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody.
sd	and that person can call, you know, beforehand and just make sure everyone knows, too.
sd	And then they just sort of do like a little program or, you know, something like that so that everyone's sort of involved.
sd	and we're all there
sd	I mean everyone's, you know mostly not farther than an hour away.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
sd	and so everyone has to update their little books or whatever.
na	I do, but not very much compared to my mother in law.
qy	Is it your grandma's own sibling
bk	I see.
qy^d	Well, maybe, they just moved away and then sort of lost contact.
qy	Have you?
b	Uh huh.
sd	like twenty four hours a day someone, has to be, Well, there's someone in my fiancee's family.
sd	and all the other children are working or whatever.
sd	But she goes in the senior citizen center.
sd	but it's only for like two or three hours at a time.
sd	and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he's not able to do now.
sd	But he refuses to consider any other,
qy	and is that how your parents feel
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and, than he thought it would be.
sd	and, he's the one because he's the one that isn't going to work every day and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone.
ba	well, that's great.
sd	so I can't say much.
sd	so if my parents do need to live with someone, it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for. You know,
sd	We feel like, it's our responsibility,
sd	But I wonder how much, you know, if one of us is going to have to quit work someday or retire early or something.
sv	This country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country.
sv	and in this country nobody really, Yeah, nobody really pays attention
sv	but you know, it's just funny
sv	and everything really isn't that much for elderly people to live on.
sv	You know, even if they're in good health it's incredible.
sv	they don't get special treatment and maybe they should, you know
qw	How old are you?
qy^d	So yeah, and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother.
sd	and then I'll respond.
b	Yeah.
qw	Well, how long have you been here?
b	Yeah.
sv	You need to get into the the system a little more and know where to take things.
sd	and we didn't recycle at all before we came
sd	we save most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now.
sd	in behind Walmart they have bins
sd	and then we usually save up our cans and change them in for money.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and, Now they aren't worth much right now,
sv	but it's better than nothing ,
sd	and hopefully we'll be getting them in the month of October.
sd	but the trucks that were supposed to do it, there's been some problems with from what I've read in, you know, the mail that we get
sd	I get tired of newspaper littering the garage .
sv	I feel guilty we don't recycle our milk containers because they seem like a big waste.
b	Yeah
sd	they fill up the whole kitchen garbage can
sd	and I think that's when I'll start doing the plastic, too.
sd	I've gotten used to washing you know, the, salad dressing bottles and things like that,
sv	but we can do our part take an extra minute or two.
sd	when we first were here, it was like we'd take maybe a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full,
sd	and it would be like two dollars but since last time we've gotten more like a dollar.
aa	Yeah
sv	I think, more people are are recycling.
sd	and whatever pop we drink, we used to take the boys out for a bike ride, and pick up the litter, you know, the cans
sd	but we haven't done that for a long time
sd	and , you do get to stop once in a while when there is a can to rest ,
sv	and that will spur you on,
sv	All right, well, it sounds like we're doing our part and at least starting, Trying
sv	that's all you can do
sd(^q)^t	if it's been long enough, five minutes is when they cut in and say, we don't have any more room for recording .
fc	So we can say good bye now.
fc	and maybe we'll get on line again.
fc	Thanks, Sherry.
sd	the way I work, the way I dress for work is, this year, nineteen ninety one has been really suit and tie,
sd	or I shouldn't say suit, but coat and tie every day.
sd	a year ago, I changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group.
sv	I guess it's a different set of standards, I guess.
sd	I mean, pretty much it's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat.
qo	How do you dress?
b	Uh huh.
b	I understand.
b	Right.
qy	So, does it change?
b^m	no.
qy	or, I guess, do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that?
sd	So, back in my old job, up until through nineteen eighty I would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like,
sd	but, probably once a month or so, there was some reason that I would have to put on a suit. For a customer presentation or something.
b	I understand.
sv	it seems like T I is pretty cut and dried with like, two or three levels.
sv	there's the upper management that always wears gray suits. And the people that don't,
sd	if you, if I want to say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like I used to be in that research
qy^d	and I guess you are.
sv	and then there's kind of the branch manager level or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing.
sv	But there's not much,
sv	It's nice that there's not a requirement for it.
sv	I guess you see those once in a while.
aa	Sure.
sd	I'm not even sure what they are.
aa	all right.
sv	but, I think we, we did it .
qy^d	and your name was Lisa.
ba	Great.
sd^e	and I work in the north building.
ft	well, thank you.
fc	good day.
qw	the question was, what kind of books do you read for entertainment, I guess,
ba	With two little kids I can understand that.
qw	what kind of,
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	By, somebody who was there
b	Uh huh.
ba	I can imagine.
sd	I read an awful lot of, periodicals and, you know, almost what you call reference books.
sd	And, I'm embarrassed to say the last, you know, honest to gosh, cover to cover book that I read, I cannot, right offhand, I tried to read, one of the Michener, LONE STAR or the TEXAS HISTORY BOOK.
sv	It does tend to,
ny^r	yeah .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b^m	BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	There was a lot more to it than that, weren't there?
sv	well, it was a political move.
sv	All the other areas which I think at that time would have included West Virginia and, may have been Kentucky, a few states, you know, that were not part of the South but still had slaves.
sv	They didn't emancipate them.
sd	I've got the same problem .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	isn't much there, was there?
b	Right.
sv	and they had an interesting time there.
sv	but you know, just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole Union navy for a while from coming up the Sabine River which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story.
am	That , could be it.
sd	but it was the last, organized battle between the two units was in Texas,
sv	Texas participation in the Civil War was, minor at,
aa	Yeah.
sd	well, my wife's from Galveston,
sd	Well, I'm from New Mexico
b	Uh huh.
sv	It sounds like Iowa or something.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, my sister's living in Illinois right now,
b	Yeah.
sd	I used to read a lot more than I do now.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And, the SHADOW OF BLOOMING GROVE and TWO THOUSAND AND TEN and GRANT TAKES COMMAND and THE WAR IN THE YEAR , SPACE that was the one I was trying to wade through was SPACE, James Michener. Didn't get very far on that.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	the books are kind of, imposing to say the least.
sv	I don't think.
sd	And there's THE HISTORY OF YOAKUM COUNTY, TEXAS there.
sd^e	yeah, and I've got a HISTORY OF KINGSLEY, IOWA
sd	Well, because that's where my folks all came from.
sd	That was part of that trilogy that, Bruce Canton did.
b	Yeah.
sv	they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting, you know,
b	Yeah.
b	you're reading DUNE.
qy^g	That was a movie too, wasn't it?
bh	Was it?
qy^g	I guess the guy that's on the new STAR TREK series was in that thing, .
bh	really? .
b	Yeah.
ny	yeah .
sd^e	Somebody who, saw the movie here the other day told me it was the most terrifying thing they'd ever seen,
sd	they didn't sleep all night.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah,
sd^e	I don't have the foggiest notion what it's about,
b	yeah .
qy^d	that's the one.
qy	Even better than JAWS and some of that?
qy^g	a Freddy Kruger type,
b	yeah.
qo	first, I need to know, how do you feel about sending, an elderly, family member to a nursing home?
aa	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and, finally, she had Parkinson's disease,
sd	and it got so much that she could not take care of her house.
sd	and, that was even harder actually.
sd	and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling.
sd	I mean, she had, she had children all across the United States
sd	and, you know, she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children.
sd	And, that was pretty heart rending for her.
sd(^q)	I think when she finally came to the realization that, you know, no, I cannot take care of myself.
sd	I mean, for somebody who you know, for most of their life has, not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm, ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines.
sv	And, you know, facing that situation, it's quite a dilemma.
sd	probably one of the biggest decisions I think that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make that decision than just delegate it.
sd	and they actually had a conference.
sd	And, I mean, it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family, getting down together and doing that.
sd	and just the children were involved in the decision, because it involved just them. you know, making that decision and then finding a place
sd	and everybody had duties to perform.
sd	You know, whether it was just, you know, giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot, of the decision making, you know, like finding a proper nursing home.
sd	and, well, they had, well, they had, they had seen it coming.
sd	I mean, I, I, I har , I, I truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like, that for me.
aa^r	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and her daughter came and visited her
sd	at least her daughter, came and visited her and also her several grandchildren, came and visited her every day.
sv	it was more of a relief for her.
sd	I mean, I, I di , I don't know how I would deal if one of my parents came with Alzheimer's. or something like, that which is far more devastating.
sd	And, I, I think that what one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it wasn't necessarily, you know, like the quantity of care but the quality of, care.
sd	That the people that worked there were very were very interested that, to make it as close a home environment, as possible.
qh	how close is it to a home environment.
sv	that's probably the major question.
b	Yeah.
sv	You know it's interesting that the population of the United States is changing because, you know, now that so many more minorities, where they have had extended families for such a long time.
sv	matter of fact in the United States we used to have extended families.
sv	But, I guess as we become more industrialized and more, you know, less in a rural situation we don't, we, we, we choose not to deal with the, extended family because we feel it's kind of cumbersome, when in reality it makes things much much easier.
sv	I, I think that perhaps the extended family, you know, that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care.
sv	You know I mean, of course there comes other issues, you know, whether or not any of the grandparents whether we feel like they're going to be a good caretaker for our children.
sd	I mean they raised us after all.
sv	and I, I kind of see that, you know, perhaps, you know, we may need to like get close to the family environment and and get down to the values of, you know,
sv	money seems to be too big of an issue. With, with, with, with what's going on today
sv	and I think, I think that that may be, you know, perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problem.
sv	I mean, I mean we may not have as high a standard of living
sv	but actually have a truer standard of living.
b	Yeah.
fc	Okay.
fc	All right.
fc	Hey.
sv	 I think it's health care.
sv	I think everybody would say that.
sv	belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you,
sv	sometimes I think it's more important than salary.
sv	but, since I have three boys, it can turn out to be important.
sv	in a given year, dental expenses can really kill you.
aa	Right.
aa	Right.
sv	and then, if the cleaning doesn't get you, the orthodony will.
sv	or, pretax savings was another thing that I think is a a great, a great benefit .
sv	And I think it's really something that the government ought to encourage more because, there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in, Germany and Japan. ,
sv	and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up, the savings that you wouldn't otherwise do
qy	Leave?
sv	They may have, just plain parental leave, which either one can take.
sv	I know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think is too short.
sv	I really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks.
aa	Right,
sv	There ought to be, some compromise where, where the person would be guaranteed a, career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position in exchange for a longer period of time.
sv	and yet anybody whose gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up.
sd	I think you've put your finger on the one benefit that I would most like to see, changed . the, parental leave.
b	Right.
sv	There's no other way. I mean unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely.
sv	you shouldn't have to make it.
aa	you're right.
sd	would I like to have that.
b	Yeah.
sd	I'll take care of that .
qo	What's your opinion?
sv	When it comes to government spending, there are so many studies done that don't mean anything
sv	but we'll spend hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars on.
sv	but, it could be put to more practical use.
sd	and I read, you know, how our politicians voted each week in the paper.
sv	and what they ran on in platform don't necessarily come true in their voting in the senate or Congress, whatever.
qw	what state do you live in?
qo	What do you think about Robin Hood?
qw	What school district do you work for?
sd	I work for Plano.
sv	So, we're comparable.
sd	As a matter of fact, I just paid my Richardson taxes because I live in Richardson and supplemented the Robin Hoods very thoroughly, I think.
aa	Yes.
sd	I remember there was about five years ago.
b	Yes.
qy	well, did you read in the Dallas paper where they increased the administrators' pay by thirty three percent after they laid off all those teachers.
sd	But, you know, I'm not going to complain because Plano we all got a pay raise this year.
qy^d	You all got a pay raise this year.
qy	Is that correct?
bk	Okay .
qy	Are you on the early retirement?
qy	are you enjoying it?
sd	I say Arlington, Texas now because I talked one night to somebody in Arlington, Virginia.
qy	do they have one?
sd	Well, I learned something already .
qw	How much time do you spend with your children?
br	What?
qy	So you do spend less time then?
qy	Are they married or what?
sv	boy, you have a lot of kids.
qy^g	You you shouldn't be lonesome on a holiday,
qy^d	They have to see their other parent, I guess too.
ba	I know.
qw	What?
sd	That's what my mother said one time.
sv	and if they force them to, you know that's not good either.
qy	Well, do they all live in the area?
ba	wow.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Golly.
qw	How did they end up so far away?
qy	Those are the youngest ones?
sv	Boy, those are a long way.
b	Uh huh.
bf	So they wanted to make their homes there.
qy	are those two married?
qr	They, just working up there or going to school or what?
b	Uh huh.
sv	they do. Especially if they're meant to, I think.
sv	so it's never too late.
sv	Especially in some of these schools around here, I think they have about twenty percent older students.
sd	I've seen some people that are really quite up there you know they look like in their very late sixties
sd(^q)	and I say that's great, why not, you know.
aa	No.
sv	you're really ready to learn finally.
sd	I mean, I don't know why I even went to college when I was seventeen.
sv	It was a complete waste of money.
aa	Right
sv	We don't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the morning .
sv	yeah, we're past that age .
sv	We know what we can do .
b	Uh huh.
qy	and do we approve what other, families do.
aa	That's right.
sd	I was going to say the same thing.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	Are going to have to solve some of the problem,
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
sd	and then other than that there wouldn't be any rain. So,
aa	yeah.
sd	and I'm glad to see there haven't been any this year.
sv	Still could come,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	it's so hard to predict here.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, today it's not bad out there.
b	Uh huh .
b	Yeah.
qy^g	So you do that even in January,
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's interesting.
b	Uh huh .
sd	People that I know that come from, like Georgia or North Carolina, Yeah, they say, it's,
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
ng	I was central California.
sd	Central valley.
sd	But it's a dry heat, yeah.
sd	I know. Well, I lived in Africa for a couple years in Cameroon
sd	and it really feels similar to this during the summer.
sd^e	I still work with Wycliff Bible Translators.
sd	It's an organization where we are looking to translate the BIBLE into languages of the world that aren't yet written.
sd	or you know, first an alphabet is developed
sd	the international headquarters for Wycliff Bible Translators is right here in Dallas.
sd	That's what brought me here,
b	Yeah.
sv	I thought the fall was really nice.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	you probably do a lot of that with scout scouting.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qo	So, Julie, how do you feel about AIDS research?
sv	it would have made even better economic sense to, to have had a lot more research than a l , longer ago.
sv	You know, you know, because, the country's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but what they do is, if, you know, you apply for to get a insurance policy they'll, check to see if you're H I V positive
sv	so you'll never be able to get insurance ever again.
sv	I think a lot of it was just that, you know, because of, of the, audi , you know, because, because the majority of the high risk groups were people no one really cared about.
sd(^q)	one, one h , one humorous retort I heard someone, you know, who claimed that, you know, AIDS was, you know, God's punishment was that, then lesbians must be God's chosen people.
qy	d , you mean, do you actually think we're doing enough right now to,
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv(^q)	I mean, it seems that, you know, it's just going to reach a steady state a lot, lot higher point than it will if you know, we'd nip it in the bud to quote Barney Fife.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I would probably agree with that.
qr	so do you think it's more important to spend money on research or for support of, people?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
nd	Well, they just kicked it off down here in Sarasota county.
sd	they started first in Sarasota City. you know, which makes up a pretty small portion of the county actually.
qy^d	And, they've got these, I don't know what, if you're familiar with Sarasota county at all.
sd	it's county wide program now.
sd	And what they've done is they've broken everything down into garbage. yard trash. Plastic, cans and glass. And then, paper.
sd	Which, in the paper, it's just, newspaper and corrugated cardboard. Is the only thing you're supposed to put in there.
sd	No slicks.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b^r	Yeah .
sd	but it's the other big vitamin company? Shaklee.
sd	and, and what she said that generally, the problems that people have with being environmentally conscious is number one, they don't want it to change their lifestyle and like, you know, especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything.
sv	that's, that's what recycling at home sorting does, you know.
sv	I mean it's a little extra work.
sv	And, it can actually turn out to be a lot of extra work because what they do, what they do here in Sarasota county is they've got,
sd	and you set it out by the curb.
sd	or you can have bundles up to a certain weight, and certain dimensions, tie them up and put them by the curb.
sd	and it's about one by one and a half foot wide and long.
sd	This is a little container.
sd	Then they have a blue one the same size for the paper goods.
sv	and you know, and, and if you've got, food containers or anything like that, it's a big problem.
aa	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	This is true.
aa	This is true.
b	Uh huh.
sd	they've got these large garbage cans that you can rent from the waste management company here. if you want to have a nice garbage can, you know.
sd	and it's big.
ny	Yeah.
b^m	Yeah .
sd	but out here in the county you have to rent them.
sd	And they just add it on to your water bill or something.
sd	East of Sarasota.
b	Uh huh.
ny	Yeah.
sd	About an hour. About an hour south of Tampa .
sd	but those guys, they just kind of get into, s , stewing up trouble, you know. With the callers and things like that.
sd	and from listening to that, I kind of got an idea that I thought would be good with
sv	the welfare program that's going on right now.
sv	I don't know if there's so much wrong with the public schools, as much as, we're expecting too much out of them.
sd	Minnesota, Wisconsin.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, it is getting very expensive to run schools,
sv	There's just so much, more and less money to do it with.
b	Yeah.
sv	and, I think it should go right back to the parents. If you don't train your kids right then .
aa	yeah.
sd	I know when I, was going to school it wasn't uncommon for a teacher to strike a student that was misbehaving.
sv	and they could probably lose their job .
aa^r	yeah .
sd	It seems that'd be a subject that I don't have much to say on .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah .
b	Right.
sv	I know in a lot of cases, different districts like to have nice fancy schools.
sv	And maybe they should be a little more, concerned with paying the right people to teach and be, satisfied with maybe a little older school.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I don't foresee them, building a new one for a long time because they can't afford it.
sd	I get, I get that experience starting next fall with kindergarten.
b^m	Yeah.
sd	But, being one of these late in life mothers, I've listened to everybody else's, you know, complaints as to what's the matter with either their kids or the school system.
sd	So I've been surprised.
qy	are, do you have school age kids ?
bk	Oh.
qy	Such as?
b	Uh huh.
sd(^q)	I thought, Christ, they're letting me in, to, you know,
sd	I don't know anything about it.
sv	And even if I knew how to teach the subject matter, I don't know if I'd know how to handle that kind of a group of kids.
sd	and there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that are going to be attending this school.
sd	What I'm seeing now, in terms of kindergarten preparedness, just from, in, in different preschools it's like day and night.
qh	And I wonder, how do they handle a child who is obviously very ready and another child who doesn't even speak English, let alone know her colors.
sd(^q)	I thought, well, how do you weed those out?
sd	They said at the bottom of the S A T scores of graduating college seniors are usually those people that go into education.
b	Yes.
qh	are the rest of us who went for the big bucks, you know, staying out of, you know, where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated to spend some time teaching or something with these kids?
h	I don't know .
sv(^q)	At the same time you think, God, I hope I don't sound like a stage mother because, right now if you ask my friends t , put twenty mothers in a room and ask them how many have gifted children, you're going to have twenty hands, you know, up there.
sv	it's not a kid who's, you know, precocious.
h	I don't know.
ad	don't say that.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and I think, you know, you have to teach how to write an answer and, you know, how to construct a thought process.
sv	And if they can't, I mean if they have missed that training, then somebody, you know, before you're start penalizing them with bad grades for not being able to communicate what they're thinking, teach them these basic skills.
sd	but boy he sure had trouble, you know, putting things on paper.
sd	And at that point, he has now graduated from warfare electronics school with honors.
sd	This is the kid who really, you know, barely made it through high school.
sv	And I keep thinking, you know, it's really not too late at any point to do, you know, some ,
aa	Yes.
sv	Otherwise, he might have been driving trucks or framing houses, you know, from here to eternity.
sd	You know, it does make me nervous.
sv	Maybe I should volunteer to, you know, teach what I know.
fa	I'm sorry .
sd	and I'm Melanie from Harrisville, Utah.
sd^t	Bill, we're talking about family reunions.
qy	have you ever had to plan a family reunion?
bk	Oh.
qo	And how did you feel it went?
bk	Oh.
^h	let's see what else.
b	Uh huh.
ba	boy .
b	Uh huh.
qo	Well, what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together?
bk	Uh huh.
bk	Uh huh.
ba	that's good.
qy^d	it was just pot luck.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	show off a little bit .
qw	Now how old is she?
qy	is she, you know, pretty.
ba	wow.
ba	that's neat, that she's in good health, and at that age.
sd	but I found that advance planning was the key to success.
ny	Uh huh.
ba	that's wonderful, though .
b	Oh.
sd	I have a brother lives in Australia, to, Boise, Idaho, and, all kinds of places.
aa	We are .
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my gosh.
qy^d	They must really like it there.
b	Oh.
fp	Hi Diana.
qy	Have you all been able to do much as a family these days?
qy^r	Have you all been able to do much as a full family these days, all of you.
b	Yeah.
qy	Do you work outside the home?
sv	it makes it a little bit easier, I think, that way.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	So you have a break too.
b	Uh huh.
bf	It sounds like you might too.
sv	and phone calls that's about it.
sd	yeah, that's what we mostly do, pretty simple things.
sd	Especially since my youngest one is , excuse me, only fourteen months.
sd	she's really getting to the age where she's playing, and likes to go places.
aa	That's right.
sv	that's a big thrill for them.
b	Yeah.
aa	that's true.
qy	have you ever been to the Science, it's called the Science Place?
sd	and we went there a couple of weeks ago
sd	We've only been in, I think it's Science Place Two.
sd	the thing that sticks out most in my mind is like a kids place area.
sd	they really seemed to go wild in there.
qw	Where's that.
b^r	uh huh.
b	yeah.
sv	It's a little bit of a ways,
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's sounds fun too.
qy^d	and you said about Plano and Campbell is the petting,
sd	I think maybe we'll try to do that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	you don't have to have tokens for everything.
b	Yeah.
sd	Well I've gotten some good ideas from you .
fc	but I'm sure that will be good.
fc	It was good talking to you.
fc	I really appreciate your suggestions.
fc	bye bye,
o	Jeri?
sd^t	We're supposed to discuss crime in the United States and what can be done with it.
sv	They're usually pretty broad anyway.
qw	Where do you live?
bk	Okay,
sd	so when I heard the topic I was thinking of the thing down at, Maceo High School in Dallas.
aa	It is, you know,
sd^e	mine are already in college now,
sd	at least when they were in high school, it was beginning but not like the rampages.
aa	That's true.
sd	well, I just don't understand of course, in my little world, how guns could be so available.
ba	my heavens.
sv	Well, maybe that's the answer to crime is getting more prosecution.
sv	and people don't do anything.
sd	And all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help.
sd	But nobody did anything.
sd(^q)	Nobody even called the police to say, you know, I hear a strange screaming
sd	I don't blame people with today's society about going out to help themselves.
sv	and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention.
sv	I can't say they don't care, because people just have to care about another person.
sv	But it's that not getting involved, that impersonal society, I think we live in today.
qy^g	he didn't have a license for the gun, correct?
b	Uh huh.
o	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
aa	That's true .
qw	what is your suggestions?
b	Out of each child.
b	Each individual child.
b	Right.
aa	Yeah.
aa	But, I mean, I definitely agree with you.
aa	That's true.
qh	I mean, what does this have to do with getting, you know, a computer science degree or whatever, you know?
sd	And then we have to take another one that's mid eighteen hundreds on up, to basically present.
b	Yeah.
sd	well that's, basically what they're doing.
aa^r	Yeah,
sv	I mean, if a child has, claustrophobia, I mean, that's just going to terrify him, you know
sv	I think that's not the way to you know, discipline a child by putting him in a closet .
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	,
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	that's true.
sv	So, they're definitely going to work towards being good, you know, rather than trying to act up and be bad, you know.
qy	I mean, don't you think?
h	But I don't know.
sv	I mean, they do things that they need that.
qo	what type of things do you do as a family to spend time together.
sv	with lots of kids you don't have lots of money for recreation.
sd	and we just have a hoot playing hide and seek when it's dark in our house,
qy	Have you taken a lot of vacations together
b	Uh huh,
bk	Oh.
qw	now where do they live?
qy^d	so that's a bit of a drive for you there.
qy^d	so you like to go there for the holidays
qw	what are the ages of your kids then?
qy^g	So you have some in the nest and some out,
sd	and then they go down to four.
ba	I bet,
b	Uh huh.
b	uh huh.
sv	and they want to do something else.
qr	do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is a positive one or a negative one?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh .
ba	That's good.
ba	good.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and it does begin with the families at home
sd	and so I'm a firm believer in that, too.
sd	and, hopefully it's going to spread, .
qy	do you have a lot of large families out there in Texas,
qy	You feel like you're in the minority?
sd	Well, out here in Utah, five is about the the average,
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd	in fact my mom's out there in Texas right now, in Dallas, spending a month with her cousins, on their ranch,
qy	is that close to Dallas?
bk	Oh.
sd	They have a ranch that has like five hundred acres,
o	Okay.
oo	or I will.
sd	Down in the south, we have a lot of shrimp, okay?
sd	And I have, shrimp that is steamed in beer, that I cook.
sd	and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert.
sd	And what's really neat about it is, the shrimp is cooked in like your rice steamer, your rice cooker.
ad	and you put a bay leaf and put some, red pepper over it.
ad	or you can just get some, you know, regular red peppers.
qy	Cayenne?
ny	Uh huh.
ad	Now if you use the dried kind? Then you would only use two of them.
ad	and then you pour two bottles of beer over it.
sd	Two pounds.
sd	That's the jumbo shrimp in the shells.
ad	Leave the shells on them so they won't just roll up.
ad	and you cover it.
ad	And you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil, and the shrimp turn pink.
sd	And, I usually put garlic powder in mine.
sd	and they shell it as they eat it.
ad	But, then the cauliflower, you, cook that in the microwave.
ad	and you core it. in like a, what do you call it? Like Pyrex or something like that, kind of bowl that would go in the microwave.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	But it's got to have one that has a cover on it.
ad	And you, put about two tablespoons of, water into this bowl, and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt.
ad	And then you just set your cauliflower in there,
ad	And you rotate it one time.
ad	Y , when you core it, you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off.
ad	and you turn it one time.
sd	And I shred up some just regular white cheese.
ad	And you cook it for another three minutes on high, you know, just mainly to melt the cheese and everything, and let all the seasoning melt into it.
sd	And, it's done.
sd	and then I put the, shrimp around the outside of it, you know, on my platter.
sd	And they have the, garlic bread,
sd	and it makes it a real nice looking, you know.
sv	But it looks like it, you know .
sd	You look like you went to a whole bunch,
sd	And, usually I cut those little cherry tomatoes up, and put some color into it, you know,
sd	and I'll lay those on top of my salad, you know, to make it look nice and things like that.
sd	it usually serves six.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	Have you ever had crawfish?
sv	But see, that's one good thing about living down here is, usually anybody that comes over, you know, even if it's like, out of town guests and stuff, they want our cooking.
sv	You know, they want it from down here.
sv	and more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	but it is, it is similar to, because you only eat the, tails of it.
ng	it looks more like a crab.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	I guess it looks more like a cross between, a crab and a lobster.
sd	But, you know, it's similar to a lobster too, because the tail has got the little pleats in it, like a, lobster would.
sd	And we call them mud bugs .
sd	it's the season for them right now.
sd	Louisiana.
ny	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yes.
b	You know,
ad	you buy it as a seasoning.
nn	Huh uh.
qy	I cook mine, well, do you have like a black iron skillet?
sd	I use, the black iron skillet to cook mine.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	The blackening is really the seasoning.
sd	I mean, there is, it's, a blackening seasoning.
sd	it's not like you would have to cook it for an extreme amount of time, or something like that, to get it,
^h	and, Well, I'm trying to see.
sd	It's got a picture of Dom De Luise on it.
ny	Uh huh.
na	Right.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ad	But you know, you do have to have it hot when you cook it. I mean, your pan.
sd	and what blackens it, is the seasoning.
fe	Oh! .
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Well, have you ever thought about coming to Louisiana, you know, to visit?
sv	you don't even have to go all the way to New Orleans, you know, if you want to really get some good food.
sv	I mean, you don't have to go that far south.
sv	But, of course, the further south you go, the better the food is, as far as I'm concerned.
sd	We're going to go to New Orleans, again.
sd	And, we're only going down there for the food, though .
sd^e	We go to the French Quarters and stuff like that.
sd	And so, usually we don't go to the tourist ones.
sd	We go to the ones that they tell us to go to, you know.
sd	And then we came back and ate, out on this, it was like a back porch .
sd	there's no where you can miss.
sd	it's unreal.
sd	The seasoning it's just unreal.
qy^d	Gumbo.
ar	No, gumbo.
ny	Uh huh.
b^m	Right.
sd^e	You can even make it with chicken or you can make it with seafood.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^h	And I'll tell you what.
sv	but in the second time, at least overtly, where someone comes in and, finds out information about you that should be private, does not seem, obviously, everyday.
aa	That's right .
bf	it turned out to be, an invitation.
qr	from personal parties or from these, phone answer, phone, commercial things.
sd	because I'm usually so insulted by them I just hang up as soon as I recognize what, they are.
sv	and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there's not even a person there.
aa^r	Uh huh.
b^r	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	and, I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country.
sd	I don't think I'd like the K G B monitoring my phone or anything like that.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh,
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh,
b	uh huh.
qy^d	Well, you must have a relatively clean conscience then .
sv	more harmed or something.
b	Yeah.
sd	I was just about to write a letter when I heard they canceled it.
b^r	uh huh.
b	Uh huh, uh huh.
^2	They had you pegged .
b	Yeah.
sv	I mean, you can't believe that.
sv	and they wouldn't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering, you know, full cash price, for it.
sv	and suddenly what started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home.
b	Yeah.
sv	If I deviate from social norms of behavior, if I run up and down the street yelling or something, someone's going to invade my privacy very quickly.
sd	certainly the language I know doesn't, but just says a word for loneliness.
sd	Loneliness is the closest you can come, which is really quite different.
sv	it's generally being alone is not a very desirable state, at least officially.
sd	and, as a westerner in India, I was often surprised, and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded.
sd	But on the other hand, I realized I could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic,
sd	and people would leave, me alone.
sv	But it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms.
sd	and it wasn't until I was thinking about it just now that I realized that's actually something that's culturally relative.
sd	of the time I've spent there, I still don't quite understand how certain things that I assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy.
sd	but for me a lot of what I do requires a sense that there's this invisible barrier around me which people wil , will respect.
sd	and I really do wonder how people do that.
sd	and they're doing something that normally I really only invite, people to.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Now, is he the elementary school?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
^2	But he is being helped.
b	Uh huh.
ba	great.
sd^e	that's something new to me.
sd	I think I read about that in the paper.
sd	Doctor Haggard is heading that up.
b	Uh huh.
bf	so you learned how to solve your problems on your own.
qy	and then he just didn't learn the right way?
b	Uh huh.
b	Okay.
aa	You're right.
b	Right.
ba	that's great for parents to be involved.
ba	how great.
qy^d	So she was able to zero in.
bk	Oh.
b^r	uh huh.
ba	no.
sv	but that's something that parents, I think, are able to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child.
sv	So, because, that's something you can do by just enrichment types of things in the home
sv	but learning disability, unless you are schooled in the types of things and ways to help a child like that, then it makes it real difficult
sv	and this to me is the benefit I see in public schools is that, you do have government money to fund, the kinds of programs that these students need,
sv	and I'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem, they test kids before they take them,
sv	and if they're a behavior problem, they're out.
sv	and, this is kind of a rejection type of thing,
sd	and we get students that come in that have been kicked out of the, parochial and, private schools
sd(^q)	and their attitude is, "I'm a bad boy," and proceed to prove it.
sd	I, would rather they not have that attitude,
b	Right.
aa	That's right.
b	Uh huh.
aa	No.
aa	right.
b	Right.
sv	If you choose the select top group out of the public schools and tested them, and then compared them to the private school group, then I think you would have a more equitable way.
sd	in, in, honesty, the kids in Japan they have to try out to even get into, to which kindergarten they're going to get into,
sd	in fact, they've had cases in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten, which means they probably won't get into the top elementary and high school,
sd	and if they don't, when they reach a certain age, that's the end of their schooling.
sv	It's only their top ones that go on, like ours do.
sv	And, and you can't compare, because they go so many more hours.
sd	The other thing is that the priority in the family is that child's education, and is that child.
aa	That's right.
aa^r	that's right.
aa	Yes.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sv	Well, and you don't see the parents, encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or, drill teams or band,
sv	and it's interesting to see them as they get older, then that is the type of adult they are.
sd	I, spent four years as a university professor.
ny	Yeah.
bh	do you really?
ba	That's great.
na	I did.
na^r	I did,
sd	and I was, given the opportunity after I'd started a management consulting firm to teach in, one of the business schools in the California State University system.
sd	At any rate, the topic is fascinating because one of the things I've done for the past few years is, research the problem from the point of view of, what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically.
qy	Have you ever,
sd	and the, teacher becomes a sort of a resource person to the learning cooperatives, I guess they're called.
sd	And there are, some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people, gain a competence with respect to the material.
sv	school systems are, in too many states, dominated by administrators
sv	and, I think certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research, of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance, particularly, accelerate the pace of learning.
sv	so it must be the way we're managing the process that,
sv	but clearly what's happened in this country is the school system's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities in the past thirty years that weren't existent,
qy	are they pretty happy with it,
qy^d	Even in Utah.
sv	Well, Utah's a place where you wouldn't think that problem would be very severe.
bf	so, you saw a fair number of troubled kids.
b	Yeah.
qo	Well what do you feel about the, present situation in the Mideast?
b	Uh huh.
sv	and I think you know, the, end of the Soviet Union will definitely have it's effect on the situation.
sv	basically since the end of World War two there was always, you know, that little proxy war going on. You know, with, the U S funding Israel and the, Soviet Union funding the Arab countries.
sv	but on the same token, you know, Israel has lost a lot of their, you know, value to the U S in being, you know, the foothold of capitalism. You know in the Mideast.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but on the other hand, you know, if they would have had a hard time retaliating because you know, they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes.
sv	had a f , they had, they would have had to fly through, you know, two enemies.
sv	The U S would claim that they would have not given them to them.
sv	I mean, of course, you know, public statements can be taken for,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I pretty much question what the U S s motives were in, in actually the original involvement.
sv	the cynical side of me says that, you know, it was more for, the domestic political situation than for anything else. You know, you know, and for portraying Bush is a strong President.
sv	I mean I really think that, my gut feeling is that, you know, he pretty much picked the fight with, Hussein.
sd	I mean I'm not saying at all that Hussein wasn't quite willing to enter that fight.
sv	But, you know, I think that, we chose to have our official feelings hurt.
sv	I mean I thought, I think that, in the past we've allowed lots of things like that to happen.
sv	I think it was, there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests.
sv	And I mean in, in along this line since, you know it really, it really didn't accomplish very much except we're getting, the Iraqis out of Kuwait.
sv	I just don't, I, I d , I, I, I don't foresee Bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and, you know, in fighting a second battle.
sv	you know, over the, over what probably won't accomplish much for him politically.
aa	Uh huh.
aa	Uh huh.
sd	but I never made it off of Oahu, which I've heard is not the nicest of the islands.
b	Uh huh.
ba	wow.
sd	My last vacation was actually in Morocco I guess
sd	that was about a year and a half ago,
sd	and we were living in France at the time
sv	and, so, you know, in that sense is just a little bit easier
sd	And, So we didn't really have enough time.
sd	We had about, a little bit less than two weeks.
sd	We rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere.
sd^e	in fact some of the days we froze.
sd	well we were there in the winter. In January or February, I don't remember which,
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's too bad
b	Uh huh .
sd	The only thing I didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide
sd	and there were some places, where people, defini ,
sd	there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off,
sd	and we had things in inside pockets and you know, in jacket underneath a coat type of thing.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd	the worst place was in Marrakech
sd	and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide
sd	and they keep everyone else away from you.
sv	and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you
sd	but we did it,
sd	and we were much happier,
sd	and you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone,
^h	,
ny	Yes.
sd^e	actually I haven't been all through Europe, like I haven't been to Italy yet.
sd	and so, hopefully, we'll get to travel a little bit too.
sd	I've been to the Galapagos Islands.
sd^e	that was one of the most wonderful vacations I've ever had.
sv^e	If you like wildlife, it's a fabulous vacation.
sd	and just the photos I have of it and gosh, incredible and be so close,
sd	August, eighty eight.
sd	a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings
sd	and so, I went to Hawaii and then to Australia and Japan and China,
ng	I, actually I didn't go diving.
sd	and so, that's actually been another of my favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips
sd	I drove from Sidney down to Melbourne and over to Adelaide.
sd	It's huge.
ny	Yeah.
no	I don't remember if I had shrimp.
ng	I don't think so.
sv	it would have been, I think, much more fun to do it like in the van, with a bunch of people.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	And I was by myself in China too.
ny	Yeah.
sd	But, it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because I hired a guide all the time,
sd	and so I never, you know, got out by myself, or not much,
sd	and, but this is from Hong Kong,
sd	It's just a train ride.
sd	I had one, yeah, two internal plane flights and a couple of other things.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	Around a thousand.
na	Japan's ridiculous.
sd	they were all completely clean,
sd	and they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line, hotels, because they said you can't stay in the cheap stuff.
b	Right.
sd	her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston .
sv	and it would really be fun, I think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver and a guide
o	All right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but you still have to pay your Visa bill.
sd	And, I worked in a prison in Fort Worth.
sv	You see it, you know the ones that have a genuine character change.
sv	and, you know, I leave that with the governor, who, of course, is going to go through every authority because they want to be be reelected,
^2	Punishment.
bd	that's okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right,
sv	Because under the law if your child back talks you, he would be stoned.
sv	see, if I don't believe that there's not a character change and the authorities agree, that this person needs to be excused, I believe for murder, rape, I even believe incest, things , that will permanently damage, the character of the child.
sv	I believe crimes against children should be punished by, by death. I believe, sexual crimes, unless there's a true change of character.
sv	but it's not, because the judicial system they've rejected the answer to all these problems they have, pretty much.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	And, you'd see the same kid who were back out there in two days.
qh	you know what I mean.
sv	I feel like that might be better, if it was run on a more scriptural basis, which would include, you know, you know, and expediting the penalties and just getting it over with.
b	Yeah.
qh	and that's why, you know, I'm like, okay, what's my role in this thing, , you know, what's my part,
qy	do you have any pets now?
b	Yeah.
bk	okay.
qr	a matter of choice, or compulsion?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that .
sd	we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat.
sd^e	They're very strict about it.
na	I love animals.
sd	our house when I was growing up there was almost never, at least one cat in the house.
sd	It was almost always at least one cat, sometimes, you know, like fifteen or twenty. But, always cats in the house.
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
qw	How old are your kids?
bk	Okay.
sd	One.
sd	He's about eleven weeks now.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy^h	originally?
sd	West Virginia.
qy^d	I don't know how familiar you are with that area of the country
qy	Charleston, West Virginia?
qy	that's pretty much the south end of the state, or the southern quarter of the state, anyway? .
sd	in the north end of the state, you've got that little narrow strip of West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania .
sd	Right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown.
aa	Yeah,
sd	well, my parents' house is like three miles south of where the Mason Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it continued that far.
na	it's beautiful.
sd	well, from my neck of the woods, it's hilly.
sd	you know, maybe four hundred feet elevation, type variations from the valleys up to the hilltops.
sd	most of the agriculture, it's more in the way of, sheep and cattle.
sd	And even that's, you know, small time mostly.
sd	the biggest chunk of what's going on there is, industry.
sd	It's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants.
sd	There's like two aluminum plants .
sd	Computer engineering.
sd	just finished up my fourth semester.
b	Yeah.
sd	it's a big change.
sd	I spent, twenty years as a mechanic
ny	Yeah.
aa	Yeah.
sd	I'm working on a bachelor's degree.
sd^r	I'm working on a bachelor's degree.
br	Pardon?
na	it seems to me, from what I've been able to find out.
sv	But, it's worth it once you get it.
ny^r	yeah.
sd^e	Most the class are pretty small.
sd	That works out real well.
sd	well, first off we'd probably wind up with a cat or maybe a puppy.
sd	I, I'm partial towards the larger dogs.
sd	our last, we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus.
sd	and they got, to be a lot of fun.
sd	we have a computer, here at the house,
sd	so I take half of that amount out of my checkbook with each paycheck, even thought it's really still there, so that I can keep, good balance, a running total, yeah through the month,
qo	What do you all do?
qrr	or does it work out pretty well?
qy^d	and you're staying within your budget and everything is working pretty good.
bf	You don't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that.
sd	we've taken that this year, and said we're going to pay off all of our credit cards
sd	and, we have, another loan with the bank,
sd	and so we hope by the end of this year, that by doing that we'll be free, and clear.
ba	That's good to be in that kind of shape.
qw	What are you all trying to do long term.
b	Uh huh.
sd	or so much a pay check and then they match it.
sd	we're putting it in C D's right now,
sd	and then we're also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund.
sd	and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and, what, what our, goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement, kids college, paying off the house, buying a different house, special thing, buying land and building our own house
sd	and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at, and then gave us you know, some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals, or not, and what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and the money we could put in at what time.
sv	that's a big thing to think about.
sd	I guess that's most of my, financial plans right now.
qy	is there anything you'd like to add?
fc	Well it's been nice talking to you.
fc	Bye, bye .
qy	Do you use P C s?
sd	You and me both.
b	Huh uh.
sd	And so I like the I B M P C, personally.
sd	and, I've become so accustomed to it that, it's second nature.
qo	What do you use?
b	Yeah.
b	huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
b	okay.
sd	So we use, an I B M P S two also.
sd	And, you know, every now and then the file gets so big, that, you know, it moves slower than I'd like
sd	but I do mainly graphic work on it. And, a little bit of word processing and then lotus applications to it.
sd	I enjoy working with them.
sv	I mean, the things you can do are endless.
b	Huh uh.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
sd	but I just don't find the time that I can use it.
b	Yes.
b	Huh uh.
sd	they didn't know how they were going to do without me at work because, I am pretty much like you said, the guru, in the office with the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is,
sd	they knew they were going to have to get a modem in the decks machine so that we could, in my home, so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so.
sv	But, you know, it's almost like we could become too dependent on them.
sd	And we use a lot of free lance.
sd	And, that's, pretty much takes up a lot of our day so for as producing transparencies and things.
sv	compared to the way the things have upgraded, Have, really,
sv	It's remarkable the things we can do now, and compared to, you know, a few years. Just the power,
sd	Mine, is just putting along .
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
b	Huh uh.
ba	now that's awful.
b	Huh uh.
b	Okay.
b	okay.
b	Right.
b	yes.
sv	The copy that you can with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers.
b	Yeah.
b	Huh uh.
sd	we're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer.
sd	the budget restraints and things like that, makes it difficult
b	Huh uh.
b	huh uh.
sd	And we, got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred dollars.
sd	but, we do a lot of transparencies.
sd	Sometimes the color would take too long to plot out.
sd	So they just want black and white, which see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick. Because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it.
sd^e	If it was a customer presentation then that would be different.
sd	and if well in our area, if we want to use it, you know, like you said, you had to change it, put it on a disc, And carry it over to there, and see if they're not using the printer,
na	Right .
sd	And, wait for an opportunity to use it.
b	Huh uh.
aa	I understand.
b	Huh uh.
b	huh uh.
b	Right.
qh	So how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you're behind the times in technology.
b	Huh uh.
b	Huh uh.
sd	We find it or hard to understand when, we work for a computer company, and, how are we supposed to present the imagine that we're supposed to present with equipment that's outdated, That's obsolete
sd(^q)	and when we try and then they complain about, this doesn't look good.
o	Okay.
qy	Your name is Lynn?
b^m	Linda.
sd^e	I read quite a bit, probably don't read as much as I would like to.
b	Uh huh.
sd	so most of my books are, I guess what you'd call self improvement type of books.
qw	What kind of things have you read?
b	Uh huh.
ng	I haven't gotten through it yet.
nn	No.
qy^h	as far as dealing with divorce?
b	Good self help.
sd	Well, probably the best one that I know of and I work with all the time is called SEARCH FOR SIGNIFICANCE by Robert McGee
sd	I don't know what the chains are down there. Maybe in the mall family book store, something like that.
sd	It's a Christian treatment organization
sd	so a lot of the books I've been reading have to do with helping them get through those issues.
b	Uh huh.
nd	and sometimes it's a struggle.
sd	it's hard for me to do a lot of, yeah, reading just for enjoyment.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's neat.
sd	I've always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college because I enjoyed some of those stories so much,
sd	but I never seem to have the time to do that kind of reading.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I've got a stack next to my bed .
sd	but I was trying to think, there's another Scott book that I've got that I had read.
sd	that's the one I was thinking of.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's interesting.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Is it ?
qy	?
b	Uh huh .
sd	I really just started.
sd	My wife has been working for T I.
sd	they tend to come out with a new book every couple of weeks just to help us deal with all the things that we have to deal with.
sd	and, I don't know when I'm going to get to them all.
aa	I don't think so.
aa	I don't think so.
sd^e	a little bit.
^h	Trying to think.
b	Uh huh.
sd	It's a lot about spiritual warfare and some things like that.
aa	Uh huh.
aa	that's true.
sv	Well, I guess we've covered the topic pretty thoroughly.
fc	nice talking to you, Linda.
fc	great.
fc	Hope you like you it.
fc	Uh huh.
fc	You, too.
o	All right.
sd^e	I exercise pretty regularly.
sd	I lift weights quite a bit.
sd	so I keep up with that a little bit.
qo	How about you.
bk	Uh huh.
bk	Uh huh.
bk	Yeah.
sd	My wife's about five months along
aa	so that is a good exercise for that.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I do it on my own schedule.
sd	but it was so difficult to go on a regular basis, to drive the distance you have to go.
sd	we've, just save the fees and buy some of our own equipment.
sd	and I use that sometimes too.
sv	but, I guess you're not as dedicated if you don't drive over to do it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think you really have to be disciplined.
sv	and I think you really have to, at least twice a week, just to maintain the shape that you're in.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
aa	Sure.
qy	Did you exercise between your first child and your second?
b	Yeah.
ba	Gosh.
qy^d	maybe it speeded up the process and all that.
ny	Uh huh.
b	Really.
ba	Well, that's good.
sd	my wife has been working with them.
b	Uh huh.
sv	But there's a lot of different things you can do that are enjoyable that you don't have to strain yourself or sweat or be real sore afterwards.
sd^e	I think we've talked about six minutes or so.
fc	Been good talking to you as well.
fc	Yours too.
qo	Well, how do you feel about it?
sv	That's like forcing someone to donate to a charity.
sv	I mean, and it's nice to try to teach young people some, civil, consciousness, but forcing them to donate basically their time and efforts,
sd	I don't either.
^q	I think that's dumb.
sd	I've been here for, just well, no, almost four years.
sd	And I lived with Dana in school.
sd	That's how we know each other.
sd^e	last weekend. We went to Six Flags Saturday.
sd	Had a good old time.
sd	I mean, the recording mentioned the Peace Corps.
b	Yeah.
sd	and every once in a while I'll do, a, local Big Brother Big Sister thing.
sd	Or I'll go, you know, do a .
sd	I couldn't possibly commit a year or two of my life to go do something.
sv	they send you someplace that there's a lot of bugs .
sv	I'd probably catch a terrible disease and die.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and none of this, you go spend two years in the Peace Corps to broaden your horizons.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, I mean, in that respect a lot of people join the military to grow up and to decide what they want to do,
sv	and the Peace Corps or something like that is probably useful as that kind of a time.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I'd probably have a different perspective if I actually knew someone that had gone into the Peace Corps.
sd	But I don't.
sd	well, I'm going to go get a good job and make some money and buy a nice car.
sv^t	and I guess they keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it.
aa	Yeah.
aa	I know.
sd^t	probably five or six.
sd^t	Not a whole lot.
qy^t	Did Dana sign you up for this?
sd^t	so they mailed me the information that I filled out .
sd^t	I've talked about the weather.
sd^t	So that was pretty interesting.
sd^t	And I talked to somebody about credit card usage.
sd^t	and they didn't have much credit available to them.
sd^t	And so she basically didn't use credit cards and didn't know very much about them and how they work, and how you can use them to your advantage, and how, you know, you can do certain things with them.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd^t	and I haven't gotten a one of them yet when I've called.
ba	how funny.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and I can't even I can't even grow an ivy.
sd	Well, I killed it pretty quick.
qo	what type of magazines do you have?
qy	do you, receive a lot of information on skiing through the SKI MAGAZINE?
bk	Uh huh.
qy	do you think
bk	Oh.
qy	did you receive information from your skiing magazine?
bk	Oh.
ba	that sounds nice.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
ad	well, you need to come out .
b	Uh huh.
sv	it's wonderful snow .
sd	so the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING has just been a great, great help.
sd	I like that.
aa	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
sv	Every once in a while they come in handy .
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
b	that.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and they like to go through
sd^e	and so we've found good use for those.
b	Oh.
sd	Well, I do have a boy in junior high, too,
o	advice on son or daughter going to college.
sd	that's advice that I will need in time future for my children, rather than one that I have, personal experience with .
sd	I suppose I would ask what the child wants to do in life and what the child hopes to get out of college and what sort of college would best meet those needs.
qw^t	What advice would you give?
sv	I guess one clear cut piece of advice is by all means visit the college campus.
sv	talk to faculty members and students.
^h	I'm thinking what problems my children might have in that,
aa	but I agree with you.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well, course it is a big factor in having an understanding of how much parents will pay and how much has to come from other sources and you're willingness, one, to work during the summer or part time. And to, to take out loans to assume, debt after college.
aa	Yes.
sd	Mine is twelve.
fo^c	Hello?
sv	I think it's more a burden to provide for.
sd	I feel less strongly about the T V s and refrigerators.
o	Okay.
sd	The Dallas Cowboys.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	they're going to get better.
sv	That kind of killed them at the end of the season last year.
qw^d	So, I don't even know who your favorite team is, actually.
bk	Okay.
qy	Has Herschel Walker done much for them?
h	I don't know,
h	But, I don't know.
sd	Emmett Smith,
sd	I'm pretty impressed with him so far.
sd	and he was supposed to go.
x	,
b	Yeah.
sd	I have no idea.
sd	No earthly idea.
qy	did they make it to the play offs at all?
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	Kind of like the cowboys,
sd	I don't know about the Vikings .
sd	Just hadn't heard much about them lately.
sv	he never really got in a game, never did a whole lot.
sv	and so, no one's going to have much faith in him any more.
qw	who is it, Michael Irvin
qy^g	it was his shoulder, wasn't it, that he had the problems with?
sd	But anyway, they're trying to you know, keep him, from reinjuring anything, but anyway .
qw	Thirty day notice for what?
b	really.
sd	I can't remember.
sd	I usually have, too .
sv	so I guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in.
qo	So other than the Vikings, who do you like?
bk	oh.
b	Yeah.
qy^2	Back when they were in Saint Louis?
sv	Other than that, I mean, you know, you know, when you grow up in a city that has you know, one of the greatest football teams until the last few years, you kind of tend to get caught up in it.
b	Yeah.
sv	I think tickets are,
ny	Yeah.
sd	but obviously yeah, they're all going up, more or less is what it's going to do.
sd	So maybe this year .
b	Uh huh.
aa	I do, too.
sd	I think if it's a con , if it's a convicted, felon on parole and he goes out and commits another crime or kills somebody, you know, I, I feel the same way,
sv	and he should be taken out .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
sv	you don't hear too much of those cases.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's right.
b	Right.
sd^e	it sure is.
aa	it's,
qh	because you know, if somebody has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death, how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of execution?
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yep.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
o	Okay.
sv	Because they feel like so many of the politicians are like crooked, you know?
sd	We vote every time.
b	Right.
sv	And maybe let them have some mock, I mean you know elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start really young.
ba	That's a real good idea.
b	Right.
ba	God.
b	Right.
sd	but down here, Louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all.
qy^d	I mean, I'm sure you heard about some of ours.
sd	And that's the reason I said maybe if you had something like a block party.
sv	I mean it could be like a sign that they would put down at the end of your block. You know, or anything like that
sv	One crook is as good as the other one.
sv	And they don't bother to listen to what any of them have to say.
sd	I don't care how small the ballot is, {E I mean, } if there's one thing, if there's one issue,
sv	because the way I feel is if I don't vote, then I don't have any reason, to gripe.
na	Right.
sd	you know, but they didn't go vote.
sv	And, like you said, if they would start when little kids and start letting them vote and learn how to vote and all. and the importance of it because, okay, if you don't vote for your friend over here, well your friend's not going to have a chance.
sd	and you voted for like cheerleaders and different things like that
sv	but they should start that a lot earlier.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Right.
b	Right .
sv	And, okay, this candidate tells you some things that are going to happen
sv	and this candidate tells you some things.
sv	but they have to do whatever these people, whichever one the other people elect do.
sv	but you're going to have to do what that person says,
sv	they would understand probably by the time they were in high school,
sv	they'd be ready to vote.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	I think that sounds great.
sv	Well, you know, they'd have to start when they're real young.
sd	the first time I voted, I never voted in high school because there was never anyone that showed us how to use the voting machines,
sd	so I didn't vote because anybody that went in there and they asked a question, all the other kids laughed at them.
^q	she don't even know how, wah, wah .
sd	And I mean it took such courage you wouldn't believe to go vote the first time because I was waiting for somebody to laugh at me because I didn't know how to work the machines.
sd	I was a married person.
sv(^q)	Where if they'd had a class or something or just a short time, you know, to, said okay, this is the way,
sd(^q)	I said because I want him to know how to use one of these
sd(^q)	but I want to show him how to use it so that he'll be able to vote .
sd	and now he's a registered voter.
sd	But he would not vote before then.
sv	And, I mean, I think that's bad.
sd	they have bins
sd	and I think that's all they have.
qo	What about you guys?
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
qy	For smashed cans?
b	Uh huh.
ad	can you hold on for just a minute?
sd^t	I'm going to try pressing one again to make sure that I pressed it hard enough because, okay, just succeed .
sd^e	well, I guess,
qy	Well, when you buy like, canned drinks and stuff like that, do they charge you for the deposit?
bf	so when you turn in the cans unsmashed, you're just, like, reimbursed.
bf	Type of thing.
ba	That's sort of nice, though .
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	so you guys can actually get ahead .
sd	Like we can recycle, clear glass, brown glass, green glass. and milk jugs and, newspapers, you know,
sv	everyone does newspapers.
sd	But, that kind of stuff.
sd	and they're not reimbursed by the people who are over them or something.
sd^t	they said that, ways, can encourage recycling,
b	Yeah,
b	Uh huh.
aa	that's true.
b	Yeah.
aa	exactly.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	And one way that we do it sort of in Iowa is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops.
sv	and what you're going to basically donate to a Goodwill or whatever, anyways, you can get a little bit of money for.
sd	And so that's something that I've never,
sv	But that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle, I guess.
qo	How do you feel about gun control?
qy	Well, don't you think that you know, just having, you know, some, you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry.
sd	There is no national,
sv	in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon. You know or on probation or, you know, other obvious things like that.
sd	you, you know but have your legal right to get a gun.
sd^e	I'd probably say about a five.
sv	Seems like it's a good safe number to pick, you know.
b	Uh huh .
b	Uh huh.
sv	the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much.
sv	you know, I mean, the problem though, you know, since the United States had this, you know, pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that I think, you know, if you were introduced, you know, any controls, it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already.
sv	You know, so it's really kind of a complex problem.
sd	but I mean apparently we were ranked pretty high up.
sd	I mean I think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Just for protecting myself. You know, from burglar type thing.
sd	I do kind of live in the downtown area.
sv	I mean somebody is not going to break in, steal it, and you know, use it to mug someone, you know.
sv	You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever.
sv	then the actual shot doesn't go that far, you know, a wall will stop it pretty much.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	but you pick up the gun and point it at the person that person rushes you.
sv	And you know, you're pretty much dead you know. Because you've just told the person that you're about to kill them then, You know
sv	and then you know if they manage to get the gun from you, you know their first reaction is going to you know, stop you.
b	Uh huh.
qy	did it happen at a cafeteria or something?
b	Uh huh.
sv	and not only that, but the, repair capability of, service departments and dealerships was equally dismal
sd	and, it seemed that the only way I could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea.
br	Pardon?
sd	Well, at that time, actually, I had a Volkswagen Rabbit
sd	and it wasn't as bad.
sd	And it's wonderful.
qo	So, what do you have?
sv	All the more reason to, have a Honda.
qy	so you bought a Pontiac?
qw	how old is the car?
bf	So apparently it was the same one that was on there.
bf	and that was it.
sv	So what's the solution to that? I guess find a reputable service,
b	Uh huh.
b	Right.
ba	Well that's wonderful.
sv	You're lucky.
bh	really?
sv	The stationary bike is so, boring.
sd	But it's definitely a task.
sd	but I do it because I have to not because I want to .
aa^r	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
qy	So is it just women that go there?
sd	but I still don't like other people watching me.
b	Right.
b	Uh huh.
ba	That's, that's great.
qy	Do they have a pool
sd	I've heard that that's really good for you to do.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy^g	So you don't really feel like you're really working that hard, do you?
qy	When you're in the water?
sd	I never would have thought of that.
qy	Like wat , Are they water shoes?
bk^r	okay.
ba	that's really funny .
qw	if you're doing it on a regular basis, how often do you go?
b	Yeah.
sd	I mean it's, it's not a question of whether I want to, you know.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
fa	Well, I'm sorry .
qy	Did you ever try that?
bk	okay.
sv	Then that would,
qy^g	I guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you, wouldn't it?
bk	Oh.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Oh.
ba	Wow.
qw	What if you're already on one?
qy^g	I mean, when you go in there, they wouldn't make you do theirs. Would they?
bk	Okay.
qy	Is that what you're saying?
bk	okay.
ba	Wow.
b	Oh .
sv	That would be really nice .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bf	So you really do enjoy your exercise then, since your,
b	Uh huh.
sd	I wanted, I wanted to get one of those steppers when I bought the bike,
qw	Which one do you feel is better, since you use them both?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
b	Uh hum.
o	Okay,
na	we got two cats.
sd	you know, my family had cats when we were growing up the whole time until my Mom developed an allergies,
sd	I like them.
sd	see, I'm not a dog person at all .
sd	I was allergic to dogs when I was a kid, in fact,
sd	I may still be,
sd	I wonder sometimes .
sd(^q)	It was like, that could be it.
sv	but it's not quite the same thing.
sv	all cats are indoor cats,
sv	and, you know, you know, they, they make their mess in the cat pan which is,
sv	I mean, they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats' pans .
sd	But now you get these liners, that is garbage bags, you know,
sd	and that's it, .
b	Uh huh.
sv	Same idea .
qy	Everyday?
b	I see.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
qy	So, you don't have anything right now?
qy^d	except the kid,
sd	we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out,
sv	and you know, we couldn't do that with a dog.
sv	Well , that's, That's, pampering the petals .
b	Uh huh.
sv	they don't, they can't fetch, you know,
sd	I think we had fish when I was a kid
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	It's not as much fun.
bh	, an eel?
sv	now we really get sick .
b	Yeah.
sd	Like, I remember a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha, and, you know, used to drop mice in
sd	these aren't cats, , you know,
sv	this is gross.
ny	Yep.
sv	well, a cat will do the same trick .
sd	I had a friend in col , I had a friend in college who had a pet rat for a while.
sd	and she got it from the psych department.
ba	Whoops .
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I mean, you know, if you get them young and everything before they go, kind of nuts,
sd	but I could see getting one from birth and everything.
sd	and they tell me the same thing.
sv	again it gets into vivant much fun, , you know what, I guess they can be.
b	Okay.
b	Right.
sv	plus, I mean, the pooper scooper one New York,
sd	I was living in northern Jersey when that law came through, remember hearing all about it,
qy^d	we were wondering if they had any special law for the horses in Central Park.
aa	Of course, not.
b	Hit the bags.
sd	last time I was there was fall so probably wasn't that bad .
sd	I mean, it was in the, yeah, it was almost like October of eighty five,
sd	I think was the last time I was up there and at Center Park.
sd	and I used to go up and visit her.
sd^e	they're just mutts,
sd	my wife got them from, friend of hers at work and everything, you know, you know, as kittens,
sd	they're sisters,
sd	and the other one is named Holly.
na	yeah, both females, they're both spayed, or whatever it is, neutered, you know, ,
sd	and they're both declawed at least on the front claws.
sv	We don't even have to cook dinner anymore.
sv	the kids maybe on the average get, something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents.
sv	I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television.
sv	and there's also some, I think, poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time.
sv	It's so darned easy to turn the thing on.
sd	So I refuse to have one in the house.
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and you don't have to worry about them.
sv	But I don't think it's too good.
sv	and, you know, whenever you're with your kids, you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them.
sd	I guess our big outlet is music.
sd	and our, nine year old daughter plays cello
sv	I guess that's not a big surprise.
sv	But I imagine with infants most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them. Although,
sd	and I still try to read to them, although our son is not liking that anymore.
qy	Have you ever seen that yet?
sd	I tell you I read that book to my kids so many times I almost have the thing memorized.
sd	Well, I think his sleep book is my favorite.
ny	Uh huh.
b^r	uh huh.
qw	So how much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day?
ba	that's great.
qw	how old are your kids again?
b^m	Two and one.
sv	that's for sure .
qo	what do you do this weekend?
qo	what do you have planned for your yard?
b	Uh huh.
qw	What part of the state do you live in?
sd	My wife and I, we live in Dallas too,
sd	we're going to have to do a lot of lawn and garden work there.
sd	in Plano, and the soil has such a high clay content, that, I went to use my dad in law's tiller and it about for my arms off, sockets .
sd	and then when it gets wet, you know, you don't even want to get out in the yard,
sd	it's horrible.
qy	where you live is there a real high, alkaline or ash content
sd	I know right where that's at.
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really.
qy	is it limestone underneath?
qo	How do you put trees in there?
bk	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and they, they turned out pretty poor.
sd	I wi , I just wish I'd known , the variety and everything.
sd	and, I mean, they just grow so beautifully.
qw	Like what type roses?
b^m	hybrid teas.
sd	they're kind of like the bush roses.
sd	But, I don't know I think it only has about five or six more years to go because it's a really old bush,
sd	and the roses just seem to survive just fine there.
b	Uh huh.
qr	have you, done a lot of tree surgeon work on your trees or not?
b	Yeah.
sd	just if you want a lot of, you know, light for underneath, that may be all right because because we have some, we have some old fruit trees.
sd	We have a plum that's just about ready to go,
sd	but they really need pruning.
sv	It just seems like that even, you know, pruning once a year is really not enough
qw	but, what kind of, what kind of grass are you growing?
b^m	Bermuda.
sd	I've been trying, a mixture of, the bermuda and the rye,
sv	but it really doesn't.
sv	A lot of, silt that comes in it just doesn't seem to hold it very well.
sv	but the rye does really well. Especially during the wintertime.
sv	but, boy, once it gets over seventy, seventy five degrees it just dries up, shrivels up and dies.
sd	well, it's already been built and everything.
sd	but, this is out in west Texas,
sd	and they just, , have some problems, big time problems
sd	they just, so they just washing , watching their lawn just blow away.
sd	They have about two or three acres of land on lake front property, on the side of a hill.
sd	I mean, you can see the house from, you know, miles away,
sd	but, they save a lot of energy
sv	It's going to be from the ground up.
sv	The whole way.
sd	I mean, have the, all they have are mesquite and cottonwoods,
sd	and, it's all on Lake Greenbelt , that property out there.
sd	they have all the water they want,
sd	but they can pump water up from the shore,
sd	they have to pay like some kind of fee per year.
sd	But, right now though I think they're just, they're trying to get the trees planted and everything.
sd	and some places, they, they really nail them for tax.
sd	And, I mean, your talking what, just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes.
sv	it's ridiculous.
sd	because even though it's far out there, it's just that Lake Greenbelt , you know, they, they try to do it just from selling the water.
sd	But, the water usage, you know, they try to limit, even though there's three or four streams that flow into it, people still use it enough like in towns like Clarendon and other areas where they irrigate.
sd	but, the irrigation because it's gotten so bad the past few years,
sd	they don't even start growing until May, May or April, like after it's been raining for a few months.
sd	they don't do anything.
b	Uh huh.
sd	my wife and I, on the, on the south side of our house we planted some gardenias.
sd	but during the fall when it stopped, when, the rain let off just a little bit I mean, it just dried up.
fp	how are you today?
sd	Well as a matter of fact before we started this conversation I was working on my P C at home.
qy	Do you have one?
b	Yeah.
sd	but it is the I B M clone.
sd	It's not the T I P C from back when.
aa	Right.
sd	that's what we have.
sd	and, but I work at home.
nd	So I use it for that quite often.
sd	so I do a lot of that work on it as well.
b	Uh huh.
aa	it is.
sd	you can.
aa	that's right.
sd	we didn't decide to get one until I started working at home.
sd	for us it really took, you know, a business application to justify the expense of it.
b	Really.
sv	She could just as easily do those things by hand.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	my gosh.
b	Right.
sv	And you know there's not going to be those adding mistakes that we all make.
sv	Not unless somebody really enjoys it. Or perhaps is using it for education.
sd	A little Sesame Street one
sd	and he really likes that one.
aa	That's right.
sv	especially now when they get to junior high school, and even college.
sd	and she had to have a computer.
sd	I mean, it was like a necessity.
sd	She couldn't imagine going through college without a computer.
b	Right.
qy^d	any more I don't even know if a college kid would have a typewriter .
nn	no.
b	Uh huh.
sd	and then he went on and got his Master's degree while I was working.
sd	And I'm the better typist, of us,
sd	and we just had a regular old typewriter, not even a correcting one back then.
sd	but I typed his Master's papers and things on a typewriter.
sd	boy, to have a computer back then.
aa^m	At least.
sv	on a computer you take it out, bleep, print it out, fine.
b	Right.
b	yeah.
sv	The first time.
sv	That's probably one of the problems and frustrations that it's brought about, because people do feel like, well, we can just change it.
b^m	Yeah,
b	Right.
b	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
ba	I believe it.
sv	Well, it's good that she does that, I mean, bring it to people's attention.
b	Right,
sv	Especially when they're in school, I think they would get a lot out of it.
b	Uh huh.
b	Ooh.
sv	that still could add up.
b	Yeah.
fc	Have a nice day.
fc	Bye bye.
qw	Where do you live?
sd	But I'm now in Palo Alto, California which is, I think, the recycling capital of the world.
sd	and I'm, in full, support of all of them.
sd	but the, garbage men, come by, on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb.
sd^e	we have burlap sacks,
sd	and they give us one for aluminum and, steel, one for metals, and one for glass,
sd	and the garbage men come by and, collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if they're still in good shape.
sv	And, it really pays for itself because, then the city, gets the money from the recycling.
sd	At my office, we have two big cardboard boxes in the library where everybody goes to pick up their mail,
sd	so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or so , things like that goes in those boxes,
sv	It just seems like such a waste.
b	Uh huh.
sv	We have got so little landfill space left that we're going to run out before the end of this decade.
sv	And it's really going to be a mess when they have to start hunting for places to put the things.
sd	Now we can put all our yard clippings out.
sd	they're about four feet high.
sd	And you get them for I think it's about fifty cents apiece at the grocery store you, usually buy them by the dozen.
sd	And then you put all your yard clippings and, leaf rakings and anything that will be compostible .
sd	and they, the garbage men also pick those up on Thursdays.
sd	and at the end of every year, they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who want to put it on their flower beds .
b	Yeah.
sv	If they make it so that it's not a horrendous inconvenience, I think most people would.
b	Right.
sv	I think it's, to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up, then to get that two cents when you take it to the store.
sd	We still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans, for cash.
sv	But so few people, have enough to make that worthwhile you'd spend more in gas getting down there then you get back.
qy	Now do the grocery stores in Houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags?
b	Uh huh.
sd	well, we can get a nickel apiece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused.
sd	They can just subtract it from your bill,
sd	and they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags,
sd	and they say, as long as it's clean they don't want a plastic bag that's full of goop .
sd	so right outside the back door, I've got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles,
sd	and now we've got the bag for the plastic bags .
b	yeah.
ba	that's great.
b	Uh huh.
sd	they just put all our Christmas trees in the regular, compost, pickup
sd	so they did say that you had to put it out within, I think it was, three weeks after, Christmas.
sd	So, you know , if we have branches or something, they have to be cut in four foot lengths,
sd	but otherwise, they have to be in one of their paper bags.
sd(^q)	the week after Christmas they left a plastic bag on everybody's front doorknob with a little note on it saying, we're trying something new next week only, if you have any, of those little, Styrofoam peanuts that, any of your Christmas presents were packed in, put them in this bag and leave it out with your recycling
^q	and we'll, take all of those back and try to recycle them.
sd	That was just a one time thing right after Christmas.
sv	Well, those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills.
sv	They don't mash .
sv	And they stay forever.
b	Uh huh.
sv	they really have to rely on businesses that generate a lot of that stuff.
sv	and you're not going to bother if you have one bag full, to drive all the way to some recycling center to turn in just your little plastic peanuts .
b	Yeah.
sd	and then, your supposed to keep it recycled every day.
b	Yeah.
sv	Well, let us hope that everybody's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get, better reuse of things
b	Yep.
aa	It sure will.
qw	How do you usually keep up with current events?
sd	So, I try to catch that, if nothing else.
qo	how about you?
b	Right.
sv	I don't really need their help to do that.
sv	I don't think radio is as bad to do that as T V is.
b	Right.
sd	but I don't anymore, maybe once or twice a year.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yes.
sd	So, I started questioning just how bias they really were,
sd	I did grow up with David Brinkley.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I frequently disagree with his commentaries,
qw	What did you think of the news coverage of the war?
b	Uh huh.
bh	Really?
qy	Did that help you understand a lot what was going on your prior experience with the military did,
qy^d	I wondered if it would help you sometimes fill in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that people like myself might not pick up on.
qw	What weekly, magazine do you look at,
b	Uh huh.
aa	Sure.
qrr	or like, does it give, I guess, little encapsulated reports and then a few big stories?
b	Yeah.
sv	That sounds good if you were short on time, you could get a summary real quick.
b	Right.
b	Right.
sd	So, we decided to try to bring one in that was a little bit better for us, so to speak.
sv	It can't hurt, .
sd	So, I don't like to go the whole day without hearing anything.
qy	do you have that?
sd	So, that's, an interesting alternative occasionally that I like to use.
sd	It, It really is, it really is nice, I mean, because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and talk, and find out about.
o	Okay.
br	I'm sorry, what?
sd^e	I haven't recently,
nn^r	no.
br	What's that?
qy	Are you married?
bh	really.
qy	So do you like football?
sd	the same here .
qy	Do you live in Dallas?
b	Yeah.
bh	Really?
nn	huh uh.
sd	we decided just to watch them at home .
ny	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	so I'm more into college football than professional, I think.
sd	I'm at B Y U.
b	Yeah,
sd	Nursing.
b	Yeah.
bh	really.
no	but I don't know.
ba	Wow.
qy	Is she a nurse in Dallas?
bk	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Wow.
b	Uh huh.
ba	Well, that's great.
ft	thanks .
b	Yeah.
sd	Right now I'm in Utah, of course.
sd	I'd like to go back.
qy	Are you in San Antonio?
bk	okay.
b	Right.
sd	my brother in law, is in the medical profession, I mean, he's at medical school in San Antonio right now.
b	Yeah.
fc	Thanks.
fc	All right.
o	Okay.
sd	I'm in Dallas, Texas.
qo	What about yourself?
bk	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
sd^e	I've lived here for almost five years now.
sd	and I'm originally from Boston.
sd	but I like it.
sd	So I like it here.
sv	It's nice.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
aa	I know.
ad	tell me where that is,
sd	but I don't know it by that name.
b	Sure.
ba	That's a nice area.
b@	 that's quite a range.
b	yeah.
sd	I'm just north of Addison Airport up on the tollway.
sd	I mean, we've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy, eighty thousand
sd	so I don't I don't even know how high those go,
sv	but some of those are pretty big.
sd	They'd all be pretty similar to one another within a couple miles.
b	Yeah.
sd	I've noticed that.
sd	but it had existed for three years.
sd	So the whole block was all foreclosed.
sd	And, so, some were vacant for quite a while before you know, they finally sold them because there were so many.
sd^e	the only thing that we were worried about was the air conditioner because they'd have it just running constantly with the doors and windows open .
sd	So you know, we bargained to get an extra warrantee on that.
sv	it's just a money pit. Really is.
b@	So . Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	no.
ad	Tell me what you like to do.
ba	wonderful.
ba	Wonderful.
qy	Are you close to getting it done?
b	Oh.
qy	Are you going to move your whole family over there then?
sv	kind of your getaway place.
qy	and it's pretty flat there?
sd	and the one in Dallas is the one that got me to doing this
sd	I liked the hills and the trees,
qy^g	and you've always, lived in Texas, have you?
bf	Born and raised Texan,
sd	My brother in law works for the University, in Dallas.
sd	University of Texas in Dallas.
b	Yeah.
sd	so, it's been a real interesting thing for them .
sv	but maybe some day they can get closer,
sd	we'll see.
sd	and, I substitute at the schools part time.
sd	so I reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school,
sd	I'm around my kids
sd	I do lots of cross stitching when I have time
ba	and that's pretty fun.
sd	I play tennis.
bh	do you?
sd	We snow ski at Mount Bachelor mostly in Oregon,
qy	have you ever been there?
ba	Wonderful place.
qw	Where in Colorado?
b^r	yes.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I can hardly wait to get up there.
sd	We're to get one to three inches tonight.
sd	so of course I'm a real Seahawks fan
sv	and, going over that pass is just a real nightmare.
sd	my children all ski
sd	since I went to school,
sd	I keep hearing these marvelous things about Deer Valley and,
t3	don't, Adam, City,
qy	And your kids all ski?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, my boys are at the point where they scare their mommy to death.
sd(^q)	Well, I found it interesting that they started off with a problems of immigration in America and then went back and said, well, if there is a problem, what should we do about it?
qy	Do you feel there's a problem with immigration in America?
sd	I'm a first generation American.
sd	So I'm, from immigrant parents . Or an immigrant mother anyway.
sd	Poland.
sd	And that was, you know, prior to World War Two.
aa	But it's interesting that, you know, with the topic I think I agree with you.
sv	There needs to be more of an open policy.
sd	and, our Irish came and, you know, built the towns and, did labor.
qy	are you from Texas
bk	Okay.
ba	Well, that will be interesting.
sd	Because we have just, had a Naturalization Act where the Mexicans that were residents in Texas, I'm from Texas have become citizens now.
qo	What do you think about that?
sd	Well, I agree with it wholeheartedly.
sd	The only thing is I've got to share with you, my background is from New Jersey.
sd(^q)	So, when you were giving your answer I was thinking, is this a Texan I'm talking to? .
sv	Because Texan philosophy is a little different.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah,
qy^d	well, then you have first in the experience on immigration.
ba	Well, that is interesting.
sd	Well, I wonder, you know, even with those that were involved with Tienamen's Square.
qh	You know, did we really protect them?
b	Yeah.
qo	Well, what do you think about,
sd	we have in Texas a large Vietnamese population that has been brought in.
sd	And these are not the brightest.
nd	I mean we we're talking boat people.
sd	We have a lot of boat people in Texas.
ba	Good for you.
sd	I was ready for a fight on this one .
nn	No,
sd	interesting, when my daughter was in high school, one of the custodians was Vietnamese
qy	Okay?
sd	Well, this is a very timely topic inasmuch as we're going to a family reunion this weekend.
ny	Yeah.
sd	Down at Lake Texoma lodge.
sd	this is one that's, the Baker family reunion
sd	and this has been going on I would say, at least twenty five years or thirty, something like that.
sd	Maybe longer than that, I'm going to get back into the fifties sometime.
sd	and the first time I went was about fifty seven, I think.
sd	and now it's Lake Texoma, because that's more central location for people from Oklahoma and Texas to come to.
aa	Very important, because, you'll start losing people if it's too far to go.
b	Yeah.
bf	Never get them at both places,
sd	of course, over the years it has, built up as far as the organization is concerned
sd	And then they have generally a show or an auction or something on Saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such.
sd	and everyone brings in food
sd	and it really, has worked out.
sd	generally, I think it's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people.
sd	I think normal's about sixty or seventy.
b	Oh .
b	Oh.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sd	and I were the kids, the newlyweds, so to speak
sd	and our grandchildren are going now.
sd	So it's, wound up that, we're the old folks now.
sd	and they organize a baseball game for the kids
sd	so it it's a full day.
sd	Some of the people come down on Friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend,
sd	and some just come in for Saturday
sd	and it's a chance to see some of the relatives you don't see all year long except that once a year.
sd	so, That's just too far away.
b	Yeah.
sv	It's an, all day drive just to get to this area.
b	Yeah.
sd	each year, of course, they elect officers of the family reunion
sd	We discovered how much work it is just to organize and get it together. And it takes a lot of planning, and assembling of stuff.
ba	That's correct.
sd	I don't really care for her to be president again.
sd	but it's a lot of fun.
sd	and the grandkids really enjoy it because it's the only time of the year they see all their cousins from Oklahoma.
sd	this weekend's going to be a rock and roll show
sd	my two grandsons and one of their cousins are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song you know, in jeans and t shirts and such.
sv	So, it's going to be exciting for them, and for us too.
sd	They, really get, into it.
sv	well, that generally happens.
b	Yeah.
sd	well we've, had various things over the years, to raise funds for it
sd	and again, it's not cheap to rent the lodge up there or the meeting room down in the cabins and such,
sd	but, they've come up with,
sd	and, some people do
sd	and some people don't .
fc	Excuse me. But, anyway, that's the family reunion story.
fc	Okay.
qw	what kind of car are you thinking about buying next?
qw	What year?
sd	and I'm ready to get rid of it .
sd	and I've had a lot of problems with this one,
sv	I know a lot,
aa^r	it's definitely true because,
sv	well, Honda does too , that's why I was really,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
aa	That's true.
aa	That's true.
aa	not at all.
sd	and it was the worst car I've ever owned ,
sd	and, you know, I wouldn't even look at another car ,
h	but I don't know.
sd	it was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve months .
sd	I was really disappointed because I was, you know, so, hyped up on Honda,
b	Yeah.
sd	and I have kids,
sd	I don't like the new style, like of the Toyota van, and the new Chevy Lumina van,
sd	I'm not sure how to explain it,
sd	I mean it looks, I guess, kind of like, the Chevy Aerostar or Arrow,
sd	Astro, I guess, is what it, something like that,
sd	but I used to really like the looks of the M P V because it looks more like a mini van rather than I think,
sd^e	I have a couple kids .
qy^d	I'm sure you can, relate to air conditioning . living in Arizona,
sd	I mean, it's got to have those things, otherwise, I don't care.
b	Uh huh.
bh	really?
sd	but it's not practical for me,
qy^c	Hello,
qy^c	are you still there?
sv^c	something's wrong.
qy^g^c	it sounds funny though, doesn't it?
aa	yeah,
sv	I know, well, new cars aren't cheap anyway,
qy^g	we all have those kind of dreams too, don't we?
sv^e	This is strange.
sv^c	I think, something's wrong with this.
sd^t	I hope it's recording .
ny	Yeah .
aa^r	Yeah.
sv	they're cute cars .
b	Uh huh.
b	Oh.
sd	Wow, I haven't seen those.
ba	Wow.
aa	definitely.
sv	no matter what it is, if it's a limited edition, it's usually worth something later on.
ny	Yeah.
b	Oh.
sv	Now, see, I would have figured that to be a lot more than that for something that's limited edition.
qy^g	And, well , they weren't really that bad though when they were introduced were they?
aa	That's true.
b	Uh huh.
qy	Have you seen the new, Dodge Stealth? the, real nice one .
sv	the Mitsubishi is real nice looking too,
sv	now those are nice .
b	Right.
sd	it doesn't have really the performance that the expensive one does.
sd	and it's not that great, I mean, because they really,
sd	it's not quite as nice for a little bit less.
sd(^q)	I have a hard time looking at cars like that because I think, now, there's no way I can do that .
b	Right.
bh	really?
qo	Well, how do you feel about the immigration laws?
sd	well, I'm not real sure why I got this topic, because I don't think I checked it off on the list because I know very little about the current immigration laws.
b	Oh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	that doesn't make a whole of lot sense.
b	Uh huh.
sd	Well, my family is from, Europe well, from England and Ireland and, have been in this country for, more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years,
sd	they were all born here
sd	and I haven't taken the time or effort to learn what they are.
b	Uh huh.
sv	I think they'd come here trying to find a new market for their brand of crime.
sd	I was not aware of that.
b	Uh huh.
na	I think so .
fc	Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.
fc	Thanks.
fc	Bye.
ad	you want to start?
sv	that's stuff we never even thought about three years ago.
qy	Have they stopped that practice now?
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
aa^r	yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I hate to see a car going down the street, or even a truck or bus for that matter, that's putting out a lot of dark smoke,
sv	and I know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of cars,
sd	but that particular bothers me.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
qy	Your family have reunions on a regular basis?
qy^m	Once every five years?
qy^d	you have got a pretty big family.
b	yeah.
sd	well, I am originally from West Virginia.
sd	Most of the family is right in the West Virginia, what they call Tri State area, northern West Virginia, eastern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania.
sd	Most everybody is right in that area.
b	Yeah.
sd	but she is gone now.
b	Yeah.
^h	Oh,
br	Pardon.
sd	so, the day it happens is ninety eight percent of the planning usually.
sd	we, get together, at the park, the park, and playground area of the Church I was raised in
sd	and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat .
ba	gosh.
b	Yeah.
sd	Sunday afternoon or, sometimes it has been like on a Saturday afternoon.
sd	and most people do not have more than you know a couple of hours drive at tops to get there and back.
sd	So, we have got, my wife and I have, a bit longer ways to go than most.
nd	actually, we have only made one of them since we got married about four years ago. One of the family reunions.
sd	so that makes it kind of tough.
sd	they have been happening, just after the summer semester starts.
sd	and she took that summer off.
ba	goodness.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qw	Where is home for you?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
qy^d	Well, maybe this year you can find a more central location.
qy^d	Then the majority of them are still in the Missouri area.
sd	the rest of them are within, you know, a couple hours drive.
^q	and, you all come.
sd	somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon
^q	Am I related to you?
^q	I married your cousin's brother's uncle or something like that.
qy^d	And, still, you wind up meeting people you never knew you were related to. Let alone
b	yeah.
fp	Hi.
fp	and I live in Plano, Texas.
qrr	or should I start?
qo	what about you? .
b	Uh huh.
bk	Okay.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
sv	and it's a lot of work, owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it.
sd	sometimes I think, it would be nice to have a town home, with not having all that responsibility.
b	Right.
ba	that sounds lovely.
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	So in your area then there's probably a lot of, career type people that have those type homes
sv	So it, also gives you a common bond when you don't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors,
b	Uh huh.
qy^d	there lots of pretty trees and,
b	Yeah.
ba	how pretty.
sd	and, the landscape is much different here in Texas than it is, you know, in the north. or even where you are.
qy^d	A lot of leaves to rake up too, I bet.
ba	well, see, that's another plus.
sv	and if you didn't do anything about it, then they'd probably the leaves just blow away .
fc	It was really nice speaking to you.
fc	and have a happy Thanksgiving.
fc	Bye bye.
qy	Well, do you have any pets?
bk	Oh.
sd	I used to have box turtles, well, years ago, when I was growing up
sd	I really like them.
b	Oh.
sd	I had never heard of them
sd	and they're not, high strung or over bred 
sd	and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds
sd	and knowing how they love to dig and love the water, we thought that was kind of a tough climate
sd	and, my son would rather have a Golden Retriever, though, I think
sd	now he wants a good size dog .
b	Yeah.
sd	and and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood
sd	It's B I C H O N F R I S E.
sd	Bichon Frise.
sv	so they're good dogs for people with allergies,
sd	and they love people,
sd	They had a Cockapoo, and two Bichons 
sd	and she didn't bark at all until she spent time there
sd	she's a good watch dog
sd	she has a definite personality
sd	and so, if we're leaving her, she barks at us, because she doesn't want to be left.
sd	The circuses in Europe used to use them for the acts.
sd	they'll dance on their hind legs each
sd	but they're very easy to train
sd	They run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars, I think which I thought was a lot.
nd	Well, she's no longer breeding them
sd	and, the one male that she used had a tooth problem
sd	and so she only bred that dog once because it had the tooth problem, and did them strictly as, pets, you know they weren't show quality.
b	Ri ,
sv	but, yeah, takes a lot of time.
sd	I know that the dog's grandmother, was from Plano,
sd	that's where I live, too.
sd	on capital punishment in our state, they give the death penalty for shooting of a policeman,
sd	and I believe also in I mean killing a rape victim. I mean someone in the process of rape,
sd	and I don't really remember what else.
sv	I think it's justified.
sv	Very much so.
sv	I think it should be in other cases other than just shooting a policeman .
sv	but I think if they're going to come out and kill somebody else then they deserve it.
aa	I agree.
b	uh huh.
qy	did you see SIXTY MINUTES tonight, by any chance?
sd	he's a black man,
sd	and he just got fed up with it.
sd	And he said he's had his house broken into and windows smashed and his car stolen three times and everything, trying to keep him quiet,
sd	and they're going out and marching on the corners and taking back their territory .
aa^r	I think,
aa	I think you're right.
sd	We won't allow this in our neighborhood.
sd	And it said they're going to other neighborhoods from there,
sd	and then quite often they'll get shot, because they're horning in on somebody else's territory.
sd	I think they said forty one had been shot out of one church in the last year.
aa	I know it.
sv	Well it goes all through the state supreme court system before they're,
sv	then it should happen,
aa	That's right.
b	Right.
aa	that's right.
sv	but that's the way it is .
qy^d	I don't know if there was anything in your paper about it.
sd	even Robert Redford, you know, was protesting this guy's execution.
sd	and I was so mad.
sv	his crime was just horrible .
aa	I don't think,
aa	Huh uh.
sv	and being under the influence of drugs is no excuse to me.
aa	yeah.
aa	I do too.
b	Right.
qrr^d	or was it not.
b^m	No.
sd	I think it was the south east area, from Dallas.
sd	My daughter, my daughter lives down in Rowlett
sd	and she was telling me about it.
ny	Yeah.
sd	I can't remember what the town was, some little area.
bh	Is that right.
sd	I hadn't heard about that.
qy	They just mo ,
ba	Gosh.
ba	Gosh.
bh	Boy that's scary, isn't it.
ba	boy.
qy	Have you seen those?
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah .
aa	it is.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	yeah.
ba	boy .
ba	Shoo, I guess so.
ba	Gee.
aa	I know.
sd	and they never saw her again .
b	Yeah.
b	uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
b	yeah.
ba	I don't blame you.
b	Uh huh.
sd	And if they find who's doing that to those little girls, as far as I'm concerned he could, fry .
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
ba	that's terrible.
ba	gosh.
aa	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sv	it just doesn't seem right.
qh	I mean how can it be changed. Unless the legislature will do something
sv	and they don't seem to,
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
b	Right.
sv	I think it would be worth it everybody wo ,
ad	Go ahead.
b	Uh huh.
sd	sometimes I hear some things on the radio.
sd	I only get the newspaper on the weekends
b	Uh huh.
sd	I, I guess occasionally I'll hear someone at work say something though.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Well I guess it's pretty good.
sv	there's, I guess, a lot of pressure in that business to, borderline at that.
b	Uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sv	I'll bet that was the case of the war in the Middle East.
^h	Trying to think what else is, . is current.
sv	looks like we're going to have an income tax in Texas,
b	Uh huh.
sv	I would think they could find a better way to fund it though,
sv	Well, they're struggling with it.
sv	I'm not sure there's a positive solution for that.
^h	Trying to think what else is current.
sd	Well, the other thing I can think of is, what is still going on in Iraq and the Kurd refugees.
sv	it begins to make you wonder why we didn't go ahead and go on in and, finish the job while we were in there.
b	Uh huh.
sv	Seems to have helped him though, popularity wise.
qy	were they in any of the areas where they, some of the Scuds?
b	Yeah.
b	Uh huh.
sd	I don't know anything else that's current other than the weather
qy	have you all been getting rain storms down there?
sd	we did last night. some real massive thunderstorms.
sd	Apparently, I don't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too.
sd	Caused some damage.
sd	We may get some more tonight.
sd	and it's all saturated now,
sd	we're getting some flooding.
ba	Goodness.
sv	It's a lot more humid down that way.
sv	In fact, miserable.
sd	I think there were places around downtown Fort Worth last night they got three inches in a real short period of time, like an hour or so just, a bunch.
fc	Well, I guess that's it .
fc	That's about as much as we can do with current events.
fc	Good talking to you, Michelle.
b	Uh huh.
sd	So this is something that is,
sd^e	it is.
sd^e	they are.
sd^r	They are.
sd	and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home.
sd	unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that could not be given in the home.
sd	even the people that are wheelchair bound and really are incapacitated. Go and, participate in olympics
sd	and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair that's held annually at a big mall here .
sd	So that the people are really,
sd	They need, the nursing care,
sv	and, but it's a very expensive solution.
b	Right.
aa	Uh huh.
sd	and, they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who had, apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating.
sd	And when the family walked in, his wife and daughter and son in law, they were not even aware of what had happened.
sd	and, the, the woman, the wife said he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that that would require chewing or, so, you know,
aa^r	Right.
sd	He had on a pair, of slacks,
sd(^q)	and she said "I just took two pair over yesterday for him that were clean."
sd	Well, this was just something that I was, I witnessed to.
sd	And we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour .
sd	And, with just a curtain, of course, between us and,
sd	They said he will not go back to that one.
sd	I'm glad they the option.
sd	and there was no choice.
ba	my.
aa^r	Uh huh.
b	Right.
aa	That's right.
sv	Visits everyday.
aa^m	Right.
aa	right.
b	Right.
^2	Suspicious.
sd	she really was not aware of what she was doing.
qy	do you live in a home?
b	Uh huh.
bh	did you?
b^m	Uh huh.
sd	We had it built, actually.
sd	And, it's our first home, too.
b	Yeah.
sd	well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in,
sd	I much prefer having my own home and, just the space and more privacy.
b	Yeah.
sd	it's like twenty four fifty square feet.
sd	It's a two story.
qo	How about yours?
qy	Is it small?
bh	really.
qy	do you have children?
b^m	Just one.
b	Yeah.
qw	Well, like, how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood? .
b	uh huh.
b	Yeah.
sd^e	it, it, it does, it seems about, probably average.
sd	we're in our thirties.
sd	People across the street have eight.
ny	Uh huh.
sd	their home just burned down matter of fact, last summer,
sd	and, their house is going to be really big .
sd	He's, not an obstetrician, an orthopedic surgeon.
sd	and it's it's a lot bigger.
sd	and, it's not the biggest either.
b	Yeah.
b	Yeah.
sd	you say that, because we have those architectural codes here
sd	we have part siding on the two story part and then on the back,
sd	so we ended up having to go halfway up
sd	but, it's funny that you'd say that, because there were homes in here that didn't have any brick at all.
sv	So it's kind of like, they were.
b^m	Yeah,
sd	it's like the second phase
sd	and so that's kind of why, I guess, they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didn't have any.
b	uh huh.
qy	Well, you keep up with current events?
bh	Is that right?
qw	whereabouts in Pennsylvania.
qw	Where in Pennsylvania?
ba	well, great.
sd	We're supposed to talk about current events.
sd	and I like to read TIME magazine and PEOPLE magazine to keep up with what's going on in the world.
sd	And, not and then again not everything,
sd	Political things don't interest me a great deal, except I do like to stay informed enough to, feel like I halfway vote intelligently, you know
sd	just the events that happen around the world interest me. Stay in touch with it and feel like I know what's going on.
sd	Now I have to say all three of my children, none of them are too interested in current events.
sd	But I always have been
qo	But, how do you, stay aware of most of the current events. newspaper? T V news, or what?
b	Uh huh.
b	Uh huh.
ba	that's good.
bf	Well, you stay up with it pretty well, then.
b	Uh huh.
bh	you've been there
sv	well, you would be interested in it then.
sd	but I'm always aware of what's going on like that
sv	because it's interesting
sv	they've just been so terribly mistreated for so many years, you know. I mean, through Papa Doc,
sv	I mean he was a terrible tyrant
sv	but it's still been bad
sd	I've read some things about him that he wasn't too good himself.
sd	he didn't mind having people bumped off for certain things, you know.
sv	But, It's, one of the reasons the U S you know, didn't do more than they did at the time because they weren't all that excited about him, although he's probably better than a lot of them,
sv	I guess it's the only thing that works.
sv	I think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have
sd	and I listen to the radio
sv	but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe
sv	but I think the quality of our news is just, I don't believe it could be better
sd	I really don't.
sv	I don't think our news could be better.
sv	I don't see anything that they could do.
sv	Well, you always want to think everything can be improved upon
ba	I understand what you're saying,
sv	But by trial and error over the years, I think they got it about as good as they're going to get it.
sv	 nothing is perfect.
sv	that's why we have C N N.
sv	C N N has the time, since that's all they do is news to dig deeper.
ad	you want to go ahead and tell me your favorite team, or who you think will be doing well this year.
qy	Are we talking about, is this the N B A?
b^m	This is college, College, okay .
b	Uh huh.
sd	, so, that seems to help.
sv	and, the Lakers have always been amazing to watch.
sv	and, maybe now that that's over they'll come out of it
sv	or they're not going to have any of the team left at all.
sv	Kind of like the Cowboys , I guess.
sv	We'll see if it's held on.
qy	The Bulls?
sv	Course, the Celtics are always really good, too, with their players.
sv	Be interesting to see how the Olympics does this year with all the N B A players playing on the Olympic team.
sv	and we need to talk about baseball
b^r	yeah.
sd	and I haven't really even started thinking about basketball yet
fc	it's good talking to you.
fc	bye.
