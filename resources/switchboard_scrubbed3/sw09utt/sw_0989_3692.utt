qy^g^t	A.1 utt1	They're talking about, federal government, aren't they?
na	B.2 utt1	I'm sure,
nd	B.2 utt2	well, actually probably any government,
sv	B.2 utt3	but the federal one's the big one .
b	A.3 utt1	Yeah.
qo	B.4 utt2	so what do you think in the short term we should be doing to improve it?
sd	A.5 utt1	Well, I saw a program recently,
sd	A.5 utt2	and it said every time they cut, you know, like fifty five million dollars on a certain thing, then they brag about how much money they cut,
sd	A.5 utt3	and then they go and spend that money somewhere else
b	B.6 utt1	Right.
sd	A.7 utt1	and that's why the budget is never balanced.
b	B.8 utt1	Right.
sv	A.9 utt1	The Gramm Rudman Act didn't solve the problem.
sv	A.9 utt2	They just take all the money that they say they cut
sv	A.9 utt3	and they spend it somewhere else
b	B.10 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.11 utt1	or you know, they pad out their staff, or, you know, spend it in bounced checks at the, commissary,
b	B.14 utt1	yeah,
sv	B.14 utt2	I'm getting kind of disgusted with you know, the fact that they're counting a reduced deficit as being some big step.
sv	B.14 utt4	I mean, first of all, we've already hit the largest deficit, this proposed budget has the largest deficit ever,
sv	B.14 utt5	and, two, I mean, the deficit is only, is, is as far from a balanced budget,
sv	B.14 utt6	you reduce the deficit,
sv	B.14 utt7	you're still not, you're still not, you're still overspending.
b	A.15 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.16 utt1	Right.
sv	B.16 utt2	I mean, it's just the amount that you're overspending,
sv	B.16 utt3	and this is, you know, for some reason, the way that the reporting is going on now,
sv	B.16 utt4	it seems like the goal is to reduce the deficit to some, you know, still outrageous amount, .
sv	B.16 utt6	I, I think in the long term something is going to have to be done with, sort of the,
sv	B.16 utt7	well I mean, it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process, right, that you've got, people, you know, trying to corner money for their state or for their constituents so that they can get reelected.
b	A.17 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.18 utt1	And, there isn't any sort of overall accountability,
h	B.18 utt2	and, I don't know,
sv	B.18 utt3	I suppose that, that the only kind of solution ultimately that we're going to have, is, is exposure and information.
sv	B.18 utt4	And I don't know that in general the American people are that interested, you know, to listen to as much, you know,
sv	B.18 utt5	I mean, you're going to have to know what people are doing, you know, and how, and how, how partisan and how self interested their motives are and take it to task for it, because it's not going to get solved, you know, if people are still trying, you know,
b	A.19 utt1	Uh huh.
sv(^q)	B.20 utt2	like you were saying you say, you know, hey, you know, we just cut defense,
^q	B.20 utt3	let me grab some of this money for my state now,
^q	B.20 utt4	and then we can throw in some highway bill,
sv	B.20 utt5	or you can throw in you know, some other kind of thing,
sv	B.20 utt6	and, it's a pretty vicious cycle.
h	B.20 utt7	I don't know.
sv	A.21 utt1	Well, I think they should limit the Senate to one six year term.
sd	B.22 utt3	that's being batted around.
sd	B.22 utt4	my, my dad was always a proponent of that.
sd	B.22 utt5	He, he felt that that would get people involved who were interested in being public servants as opposed to personal servants.
b	A.23 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	A.25 utt1	Right,
sv	A.25 utt2	and don't let them come back,
sv	A.25 utt3	and, keep Congress to, two terms of two years a piece
b	B.26 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.27 utt1	and then it'll be overturning
sv	A.27 utt2	and they won't have the same people there all the time
b	B.28 utt1	Right.
sv	A.29 utt1	and then, all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all of their their payoffs and kickbacks
b	B.30 utt1	Right.
sv	A.31 utt2	and that'll keep them busy enough so that they won't have as much influence.
b	B.32 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.33 utt1	one of the biggest things is that, the fact that they're always trying to lean somebody toward one way or another, whether it's the oil companies, or the automotive companies, and like the air bag thing.
sd	A.33 utt2	The air bag came out, what, twenty years ago.
b	B.34 utt1	Right .
sd	A.35 utt1	And only now they're getting that put in cars.
aa	B.36 utt1	Uh huh,
aa	B.36 utt2	yeah.
sv	A.37 utt1	And the oil companies really aren't responsible, you know.
sv	A.37 utt2	The Valdez proved that,
sv	A.37 utt3	and then the government doesn't jump on them hard enough to make them do anything.
b	B.38 utt1	Right.
sv	A.39 utt1	It should have been done immediately.
aa	B.40 utt1	Yeah,
aa^r	B.40 utt2	yeah,
aa	B.40 utt3	I think that that's probably right,
sv	B.40 utt4	because in terms of long term, you just got to get people,
sv	B.40 utt5	I mean, at one point, at least on a local level, going into politics you know, what you're doing is, is really trying to serve the community right,
b	A.41 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.42 utt2	I mean, you don't expect to make any money out of it.
sv	B.42 utt3	You know, maybe you gain a little bit of local fame,
sv	B.42 utt4	but you put in a lot of work in exchange for that.
b	A.43 utt1	Right.
sv	B.44 utt1	And I don't have the feeling that national level politicians are at all like that.
aa	A.45 utt1	No.
sv	A.45 utt2	They listen to wherever the money is.
aa	B.46 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.46 utt2	And, you know, I think that, that the problem with having, you know, junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of wasting a lot of time you know, with in , inept politicians or people who don't know how to deal with it.
b	A.47 utt1	Right.
aa	A.49 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.49 utt2	they're not as efficient,
ba	A.49 utt3	that's for sure.
sv	B.50 utt1	But on the other hand, maybe that's,
