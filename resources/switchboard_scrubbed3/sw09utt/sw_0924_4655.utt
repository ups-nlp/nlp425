o	A.1 utt1	Okay.
sd	A.1 utt2	Well, just briefly.
sd	A.1 utt3	I worked in a nursing home
sd	A.1 utt4	so I kind of know, from way back, how things used to be run
sv	A.1 utt5	and I think there has been definite changes of nursing homes
sd	A.1 utt6	but I think, if I had to personally put one of my parents in a nursing home, they would have to be pretty bad off to where I couldn't take care of them at all.
sd	A.1 utt7	It would be something that, you know, I would certainly,
sd	A.1 utt8	if they're forgetting things or whatever, I'd prefer to have them at home or have them in what they call now home care where somebody comes in
b	B.2 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.3 utt2	and they cook meals
sd	A.3 utt3	and they clean their house for them,
sd	A.3 utt4	that kind of thing,
sd	A.3 utt5	so they still have their own independence
sd	A.3 utt6	and not reliable, you know,
sd	A.3 utt7	they don't have to be in a nursing home situation.
sd	A.3 utt9	the nursing homes, when I was working in them, were very much understaffed, very much, in need of good personnel.
sd	A.3 utt10	I think the patients weren't given the quality of care that
sd	A.3 utt11	I wouldn't have, you know,
sd(^q)	A.3 utt12	I look at it and say thank God,
^q	A.3 utt13	I got out of that kind of situation.
sd	A.3 utt14	But they were not given the time
b	B.4 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.5 utt2	and they were not given the money, basically, to staff, appropriately, people to help.
b	B.6 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.7 utt1	And I can remember lifting a patient all by myself, simply because there was not another person to help.
sd	A.7 utt2	It's either leave the patient in bed all day long or get them up
sd	A.7 utt3	and I would have preferred to get them up than to leave them in bed all day.
sv	A.7 utt4	so I think nursing homes have changed.
h	A.7 utt5	I'm not quite sure,
sv	A.7 utt6	but hopefully, they have.
b	B.8 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.8 utt2	th , I guess I haven't had that much experience.
sd	B.8 utt3	I've only seen like my great grandparents in a nursing home
b	A.9 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.10 utt1	but I have an aunt who lived on her own until she was well in her nineties
b	A.11 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.13 utt1	Sure.
sd	B.14 utt1	and then she got sick
sd	B.14 utt2	and she ended up in nursing home
b	A.15 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.16 utt1	and my parents went to visit her
sd	B.16 utt2	and it got to the point where it seemed like the nursing home didn't want to deal wi , her anymore
b	A.17 utt1	Sure.
sd	B.18 utt1	and so they gave her drugs to keep her asleep.
aa	A.19 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.19 utt2	I think that can happen
sd	A.19 utt3	and I think in the nursing home that I worked for,
sd	A.19 utt4	I wasn't quite sure of it,
sd	A.19 utt5	but I'm sure that some of the patients were, given medication to keep them quiet
sv	B.20 utt1	Nice sedative state.
aa	A.21 utt1	Yeah,
aa^r	A.21 utt2	yeah.
sd	A.21 utt3	And they would just lay all day long
sd	A.21 utt5	they also put mentally ill patients in the same,
sd	A.21 utt6	they were not on the same, you know, ward,
sd	A.21 utt7	but they were in the same nursing home
sd	A.21 utt8	so these mentally ill patients could walk into where the other, older people that were in there for reasons of, you know age,
sd	A.21 utt9	the mentally ill patients could walk right into the rooms or do whatever they wanted to basically.
sd	A.21 utt10	Because if you weren't there to watch them and keep them in their own wing, they had freedom to just walk around
sd	A.21 utt11	and I think there was a couple that were schizophrenic
sd	A.21 utt12	and I remember one time watching one of the, schizophrenic patients actually go out on, I don't know what they call it, a binge or whatever you want to say it
b	B.22 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.23 utt1	she grabbed a hold of this,
sd	A.23 utt2	and it was kind of funny when I looked back at it,
sd	A.23 utt3	but, I mean, I remember the patient getting very upset.
sd	A.23 utt4	That woman actually pulled, the other person's hair.
sd	A.23 utt5	I mean she just came up right behind him and pulled his hair, you know,
sd	A.23 utt6	and it was a guy that was just really upset.
sd(^q)	A.23 utt7	I mean he said what the hell are you think you're doing, you know,
sd	A.23 utt8	and I laughed at it then
sd(^q)	A.23 utt9	but then I'm thinking God, you know,
^q	A.23 utt10	if I had to put my parents in that nursing home, I wouldn't want them there.
sd	A.23 utt11	So I think there's laws now That nursing homes either have to keep the mentally ill totally away from these people and not in the same type of facilities,
b	B.24 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.25 utt2	even though they're aging mentally ill, they are still mentally ill
sv	A.25 utt3	and a lot of these older people you know, they're not insane or anything like that.
sv	A.25 utt4	They don't have these tendencies to lash out.
sv	B.26 utt1	To be violent.
sd	A.27 utt1	But seeing that kind of made me think twice about,
fe	A.27 utt2	jeez,
sd	A.27 utt3	I wouldn't put my mother, father in that nursing home at all.
qr	B.28 utt1	Was this in a big town or a little town?
sd	A.29 utt1	A small town.
bh	B.30 utt1	really?
ny	A.31 utt1	Yeah,
ny^r	A.31 utt2	yeah.
sv	B.32 utt1	Because it seems like the small town nursing homes, there's a lot more personal attention.
am	A.33 utt1	I don't know.
am^r	A.35 utt1	I don't know.
sd	A.35 utt2	I kind of look at it this way.
sv	A.35 utt3	I think if you have a big city area, I think there's more people to keep watch on it.
aa	B.36 utt1	Uh huh.
bf	B.36 utt2	You have more options.
aa	A.39 utt1	Yeah,
aa^r	A.39 utt2	yeah.
sv	A.39 utt3	And you have more competition.
sv	A.39 utt4	And I think nursing homes have to be better than when there's one nursing home for a whole community.
sd	A.39 utt5	And this is back in nineteen seventy seven that I worked there
b	B.40 utt1	Uh huh .
sd(^q)	A.41 utt1	and I look back at it and say jeez, you know,
^q	A.41 utt2	it would have to be awfully bad for me to put my parents in there.
sd	A.41 utt3	But my grandmother, later on got cancer and, could no longer,
sd	A.41 utt4	well actually she,
