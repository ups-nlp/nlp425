o	B.1 utt1	That sounded like one.
b	A.2 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.2 utt2	I think that there is something definitely wrong with our school system just because of the results that you see coming out of the school system, as far as, people dropping out of school, grades on test scores being low, more and more people taking G E D s trying to get out of high school instead of just going through high school.
b	B.3 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.5 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.6 utt1	You know something must be wrong as far as, not just the teaching techniques but just motivation, within the schools themselves.
b	B.7 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.9 utt1	Yeah,
ad	B.9 utt2	excuse me just a minute, 
aa	A.10 utt1	Uh huh.
t3	B.11 utt2	I'm on the other line Karen.
fa	B.11 utt3	I'm sorry.
bd	A.12 utt1	it's okay.
b^m	B.13 utt1	Okay.
sd	B.13 utt5	I hear what you're saying about the results.
b	A.14 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.15 utt1	And, what to do about it I guess is the big thing.
b	A.16 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.17 utt1	I'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my wife teaches school here in Plano.
b	A.18 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.19 utt1	And, I know that, the results that they get out of the system sometime is certainly not , you know, up to what the effort they put into it, you know,
sd	B.19 utt2	I've seen that for years,
aa	A.20 utt1	Right,
aa	A.20 utt2	and, I know,
sd	A.20 utt3	I work around, you know a lot of teachers
sd	A.20 utt4	and I understand how, supportive they are of their students and how excited they are,
b	B.21 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.22 utt1	but some how, I don't think the students are getting excited.
aa	B.23 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.23 utt2	I've often wondered if it doesn't come back to the home environment.
aa	A.24 utt1	yes
aa	A.24 utt2	definitely,
aa	A.24 utt3	uh huh .
sv	B.25 utt1	And, if, no matter what they do in the classroom, if they go home at night and, you know, it's all totally undone,
b	A.26 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.27 utt1	the thing that Karen, my wife, has run into so often is that you run into a group of kids that are going to succeed no matter what, no matter how bad their teachers are, no matter what a lousy system they're in, or anything else,
b	A.28 utt1	Right,
b^r	A.28 utt2	right.
b	A.30 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.31 utt1	these people somehow manage to, you know, push on through and are successful.
^2	A.32 utt1	Progress,
sv	B.33 utt2	It's, unfortunately probably maybe twenty five or thirty percent of them do that.
aa	A.34 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.34 utt2	not even that much probably.
sv	B.35 utt1	Well, that would be at the absolute most.
aa	A.36 utt1	Yeah
aa	A.36 utt2	uh huh.
sv	B.37 utt1	And, you know, those that, you know, come out, you know, fall out of the system, that are real trouble,
b	A.38 utt1	Uh huh.
qy^d	B.39 utt1	I wonder whether that's just a part of the system, you know,
b	A.40 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.41 utt1	you know, in a democracy where, you know, people have kind of, a freedom to sort of do what they want, you know, there's an inefficiency there,
b	A.42 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.44 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.45 utt1	and you've got to let you know, those,
sv	A.46 utt1	And speaking of doing what you want, just in society today being that it's nineteen ninety one, a lot of teenagers and young people have a lot more freedom as far as what they do, as far as, you know, even something as simple as staying up late, watching television late, going out late, start dating,
b	B.47 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	B.49 utt1	yeah.
b	B.51 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.52 utt2	you start dating too early, you know,
b	B.53 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.54 utt1	just little things like that, that do start in the home,
b	B.55 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.56 utt1	that plays a big part because you spend eight hours of your day, or more in school
sv	A.56 utt2	and so any other part of your life, that's going to definitely affect your school life, because you spend so much time there.
b	B.57 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.59 utt1	And sometimes in some systems they make everything so competitive, you know,
b	A.60 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.61 utt1	from the minute that you walk in until, yo , until you leave, your competing against somebody else
sd	B.61 utt2	or your competing against, a system or something, you know,
b	A.62 utt1	Right.
sv	B.63 utt3	there is a personality type I believe that is really noncompetitive.
sv	B.63 utt4	They're cooperative rather than competitive,
b	A.64 utt1	Uh huh.
sv(^q)	B.65 utt1	and when they get into a real competitive system they just say, well, what the heck, and, tend not to, you know, do too awful well .
b	A.66 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	A.68 utt1	Right,
sd	A.68 utt2	I talked to, a guy the other day
sd	A.68 utt3	and he is now in a program that's trying to get him out of high school because he fell back several years ago
sd	A.68 utt4	and he, he will have gone to school five years.
b	B.69 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.70 utt1	and the reason that he was doing so badly a couple of years ago was because his mother died,
b	B.71 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.72 utt1	and he was having to, support his entire family, take care of his brothers and sisters, you know,
b	B.73 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.74 utt1	and all that had an adverse affect on his school life.
ba	B.75 utt1	I would think so,
b^m	A.76 utt1	And, yeah,
sv	A.76 utt2	and that's a perfect example of how your home life, you know, plays a definite part.
sv	A.76 utt3	And, you know, any other aspect of your life,
aa	B.77 utt1	Yeah,
aa^r	B.77 utt2	yeah.
sd	A.78 utt2	but now, that he's in this program and, you know, he's, I guess okay,
sd	A.78 utt3	he's making straight A s,
sd	A.78 utt4	and, you know, it, it was there, it was just, I guess school was not a number one priority for him at that time.
aa	B.79 utt1	Yeah,
aa	B.79 utt3	right,
bf	B.79 utt4	survival becomes more of a priority than education,
aa	A.80 utt1	Uh huh,
aa^r	A.80 utt2	uh huh.
sd	B.81 utt1	and unfortunately, you know, there's and old joke about, you know,
sd	B.81 utt2	education's wasted on the youth anyway.
sv	B.83 utt1	you don't really appreciate it until you're much older anyway.
aa	A.84 utt1	Right,
aa	A.84 utt2	exactly.
sd(^q)	B.85 utt1	I know when I went to school, my attitude was kind of one of, you know, these people are, you know, taking a tremendous amount of my time, you know,
b	A.86 utt1	Uh huh.
^q	B.87 utt2	and I've got better things to be doing than sitting here listening to this stuff over and over again.
aa	A.88 utt1	exactly.
sv	B.89 utt1	I guess today some how or other there would be a program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing,
sv	B.91 utt1	the cure, some of the cures that I've heard for this that sort of make sense,
b	A.92 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.93 utt1	most teachers after they have taught for a very long, especially at the lower grades can spot a problem almost immediately.
b	A.94 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.95 utt1	And, it's kind of these intervention programs.
sv(^q)	B.95 utt2	Now, a lot of people will get to looking at these and say hey that's socialism
sv(^q)	B.95 utt3	and that's communism,
b	A.96 utt1	Right.
sv	B.97 utt2	and then it gets political.
b	A.98 utt1	Uh huh.
ba	B.99 utt1	But, boy.
sd	A.100 utt1	When people start talking about programs that help, for me, I don't care if it's socialist,
sd	A.100 utt2	or I don't care, as long as it's something that's going to do some good or that looks like it could be beneficial,
aa	B.103 utt1	Uh huh,
aa	B.103 utt2	yeah.
sd	A.104 utt1	I mean, that's the point I'm at now.
sv	A.104 utt2	I mean that's the point we all should be at, is like finding some solution,
b	B.105 utt1	yeah.
sv	A.106 utt1	I mean, you know, nothing totally radical,
sv	A.106 utt2	but if it's something that, you know, might help, you know,
sv	A.106 utt3	because there's not a lot being done.
sv	B.107 utt1	Well, you know, the radical programs in some cases are just totally unacceptable.
sv	B.107 utt2	There are kids, families, that should just simply be taken out of the homes, you know. And, you know, just removed from those situations,
aa	A.108 utt1	Uh huh,
aa^r	A.108 utt2	uh huh.
b	A.110 utt1	Right.
sv	B.111 utt1	or they're never going to get anywhere.
sv	B.111 utt2	But yet, politically that is not a very popular view.
b	A.112 utt1	Uh huh.
sv(^q)	B.113 utt1	I'm sure that if you, you know, ran on a platform of, you know, we're going to find the kids that are having trouble at home and we're going to take them out of the home.
b	A.114 utt1	Take them out.
b	B.115 utt1	Yeah,
qh	B.115 utt2	you know how far you're going to get with that.
aa	A.116 utt1	Yeah,
aa	A.116 utt2	not very far at all.
sv	B.117 utt1	but unfortunately it's something like that, in lieu of that, you know, is the intervention programs in school where these kids are spotted fairly early on,
b	A.118 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.119 utt1	and, you know, well that's get to be a problem in Texas, you know, because different school systems have got more or less money to take care of that sort of thing,
aa	A.122 utt1	Right,
aa^r	A.122 utt2	right.
sd	B.123 utt1	you got counselors and all that.
sv	B.123 utt2	But you know, you can counsel a kid eight hours a day
sv	B.123 utt3	and then he goes home
sv	B.123 utt4	and, you know, in worst cases he's got parents either on drugs or something like that,
b	A.124 utt1	Right.
sv	B.125 utt1	or they don't care.
sv(^q)	B.125 utt2	You know, mamma, guess what I did in school today,
sv(^q)	B.125 utt3	well who cares, you know.
sv	A.126 utt1	An a lot of the parents now are so young.
ba	B.127 utt1	True.
sv	A.128 utt1	You know, they still, they still don't know what's going on
qh	A.128 utt2	and how are they supposed to, you know, teach their kids that are coming up, you know, what's going on.
sv	A.128 utt3	I mean it's a vicious cycle, that we're, you know, smack dead in the center of
b	B.129 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.130 utt2	and we have to try to swim out.
sv	A.130 utt3	You know, kind of like the Bermuda Triangle,
sv	A.130 utt4	we're just sinking
sv	A.130 utt5	and it's almost impossible to swim back up.
b	B.131 utt1	Yeah.
b^m	A.132 utt1	But, yeah,
sv	A.132 utt2	there's definitely problems,
aa	B.133 utt1	Yeah
sv	A.134 utt1	its just the solutions you know, they're going to be in our political system,
sv	A.134 utt2	they're going to be on everyone's mind for quite a while, too long.
qy^d	B.135 utt1	I don't know if you've ever had too much to do with, especially Asian, Japanese families coming,
sd	B.135 utt2	here in Plano we've got, quite a few.
b	A.136 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	A.136 utt2	uh huh.
sd	B.137 utt1	engineering types, people who have come from Japan,
b	A.138 utt1	Right.
sd	B.139 utt1	and they put their kids in the U S schools
sd	B.139 utt2	and they're appalled.
b	A.140 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.141 utt1	You know, not so much at what the schools are teaching, but what they let the kids get away with.
b	A.142 utt1	uh huh.
sd	B.143 utt2	they're quite upset about the disruptive influence of school.
sd(^q)	B.143 utt3	Most of them would say, you know, those people should be removed from the school system.
b	A.144 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	A.144 utt2	uh huh.
sd	B.145 utt1	And in Japan they would be, you know.
b	A.146 utt1	Right.
sv	B.147 utt1	But, here again, you get back into a political thing, where,
aa	A.148 utt1	Yeah
aa	A.148 utt3	right.
sv	A.148 utt4	There's definitely too much leeway as far as,
b	B.149 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.150 utt1	I mean, I've been out of college only two years,
b	B.151 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.152 utt1	and you were saying that you don't appreciate education until you get out
sd	A.152 utt2	and I already, you know, I really didn't, I really don't see myself going back to school or anything,
sd	A.152 utt3	but, I appreciate more what I had.
b	B.153 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.154 utt1	And I had all these classes and all this knowledge and this big library across the street from my dorm,
b	B.155 utt1	Yeah,
qy	B.155 utt2	were you at Baylor?
sd	A.156 utt1	and I just didn't take as much advantage of it as I should have.
b	B.157 utt1	Yeah,
qy	B.157 utt2	did you go to Baylor?
nn	A.158 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.158 utt2	I went to U T at Austin,
bk	B.159 utt1	okay.
sd	A.160 utt1	So, I mean all kinds of resources and, you know, just there,
b	B.161 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.162 utt1	and I'd give anything to have that right now in my regular li ,
sv	A.162 utt2	I mean you have everything given to you.
sd	A.162 utt3	I don't see why people wouldn't want that.
h	A.162 utt4	I don't know,
sd	A.162 utt6	but then, if I was young, I wouldn't see it.
aa	B.163 utt1	Uh huh,
ba	B.163 utt2	well that's it
sv	B.163 utt3	you don't have, you don't have the view.
sd	A.164 utt1	But you know, now that it's gone, I,
b	A.166 utt1	Right.
sd	B.167 utt1	I graduated from Texas Tech, more than two years ago, I guarantee,
b	A.168 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.171 utt1	and, you know, I kind of look back at it sometimes,
^q	B.171 utt2	well that was a lot of fun,
sd	B.171 utt3	but, we , you know, I'm not sure that I took the greatest advantage of, you know, what, I went through there.
b	A.172 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.174 utt1	Right,
b	A.174 utt2	yeah,
sd	A.174 utt3	I did a lot
sd	A.174 utt4	and I experienced a lot
sd	A.174 utt5	and I feel like I got a good college education
sd	A.174 utt6	but just when I got out I feel like I should have spent more time in the library,
sd	A.174 utt7	I should have taken those continuing educations classes or whatever they were, you know,
b	B.175 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.176 utt1	the informal classes that you don't get credit for, you know ...
