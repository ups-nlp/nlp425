sd	B.2 utt3	see I was raised in New York,
qy^g	B.2 utt4	but I guess up there you all don't have too long of a growing season, do you?
ng	A.3 utt1	well, we probably have about three months, approximately.
qy	B.4 utt1	Do do you do your own gardening?
ny	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
ny^r	A.7 utt2	Uh huh.
b	B.8 utt1	Do you.
sd	A.9 utt1	We live on a,
sd	A.9 utt2	used to be a farm,
sd	A.9 utt3	but we don't farm much,
sd	A.9 utt4	but we do have a garden.
sd	B.10 utt1	See I got mine in,
^h	B.10 utt2	well, let's see,
sd	B.10 utt3	I put in pepper plants this weekend.
b	A.11 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.11 utt2	I wish I could be doing that .
b	B.12 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.12 utt2	I got all my little seedlings coming up in the kitchen
sd	B.12 utt3	and, I enjoy tinkering with it, you know,
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.14 utt2	it's pretty hot down here during the Summer,
sd	B.14 utt3	we hit, you know, a hundred, hundred and two sometimes,
b	A.15 utt1	Right.
sd	B.16 utt1	but, you know, we don't do too much during the Summer, as far as tomatoes and stuff, like that.
qy^d	A.17 utt1	You almost have, to get started pretty early probably. I guess,
ny	B.20 utt1	Yeah.
sd^e	B.20 utt2	usually I can put in, probably mid March, I can put anything in the ground, you know, beets, and onions, and stuff like that.
b	A.21 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.23 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.25 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.26 utt1	But then I have to wait for my,
sd	B.26 utt2	tomatoes have to go in here in the next couple of weeks
b	A.27 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.28 utt1	as soon as we're, sure we're not going to have another freeze, go ahead finish it.
b	A.29 utt1	Yeah.

aa	B.32 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.32 utt2	We've, had just a few, you know, that freezes a little here and there,
sv	A.33 utt1	More bad weather.
sd	B.34 utt2	but every once in a while, we get a freeze around the middle of April,
b	A.35 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.37 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.38 utt1	and it's pretty tough.
b	A.39 utt1	Uh huh.

nn	B.40 utt1	No.

sd	A.45 utt2	But he's not a gardener.
sd	A.45 utt3	he, he's been helping me more,
sd	A.45 utt4	but he really isn't, real crazy about gardening.
sd	B.46 utt1	I really enjoy it,
sd	B.46 utt2	it gives me time outdoors,
sd	B.48 utt1	and, you know, I'm a golfer,
sd	B.48 utt2	but, it gives me time outdoors, and time around my house,
b	A.49 utt1	Uh huh.
b^r	A.49 utt2	Uh huh.
sd	B.50 utt1	and I, burned my grass off here in the last couple of days getting ready to start to the Spring season, and see if I can grow me another nice lawn,
b	A.51 utt1	Oh.
b	A.51 utt2	Uh huh.
sd	B.52 utt2	I usually have a pretty nice lawn,
sv	B.52 utt3	it's a lot of work you know,
b	A.53 utt1	yeah.
aa	A.55 utt1	But like you said, it's good to get outside,
sd	A.55 utt2	and and I like my garden too .
aa	B.56 utt1	Yeah,
aa	B.56 utt2	it is.
sd	A.57 utt2	we have just a small garden,
sd	A.57 utt3	but we planted corn last year too, which takes quite a bit of space
b	B.58 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.59 utt1	we didn't have too good luck with it,
sd	A.59 utt2	because we had a couple of real good wind storms,
sd	A.59 utt3	and it really damaged the corn
b	B.60 utt1	yeah.
sd	A.61 utt1	so we didn't get too much corn, last year.
sd	B.62 utt1	We're going through that,
sd	B.64 utt1	we going through the dust storms down here now,
b	A.65 utt1	uh huh.
sd	B.66 utt1	but what I did with my garden, is I have a two by six frame that's five by ten.
sd	B.66 utt2	I have two of them sitting side by side
b	A.67 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.68 utt1	and then I put, like, a black plastic,
ar	B.68 utt2	it's really not a black plastic.
sd	B.68 utt3	They call it Wedet
b	A.69 utt1	Oh.
b	A.69 utt2	Uh huh.
sd	B.70 utt1	and I put that down,
sd	B.70 utt2	and then I put up a couple of inches of pine moss on top of that
sd	B.72 utt1	and I use one of those black poker hoses that actually oozes water every where
b	A.73 utt1	Uh huh.
b^r	A.73 utt2	Uh huh.
sd	B.74 utt1	so I waste it up and down there a couple of times,
sd	B.74 utt2	and I only have to water about two hours a week
ba	A.75 utt1	that's great.
sd	B.76 utt1	and it's pretty nice.
b	A.77 utt1	Uh huh.
b^r	A.77 utt2	Uh huh.
sd	B.78 utt1	Especially during the Summer, it keeps everything wet, instead of wilting.
b	A.79 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.81 utt1	we don't usually cover ours.
sd	A.81 utt2	We did a few different times
sd	A.81 utt3	sometimes we've covered with the plastic,
sd	A.81 utt4	and other years we've tried newspapers
b	B.82 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.83 utt1	but we do our watering from our spring.
qy^d	B.84 utt1	you have a spring,
ny	A.85 utt1	Yeah.
ba	B.86 utt1	how nice.
sd	A.87 utt1	We have an old fashioned pipe sitting, that, you know, water runs into
sd	A.87 utt2	and, my husband set up a pump that runs,
b	B.88 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.89 utt2	it runs first down
sd	A.89 utt3	and then it stops,
ba	B.90 utt1	that's, that's pretty nice.
sd	A.91 utt1	and when the water comes up, it comes on again,
sd	A.91 utt2	and we use that to water our garden , with
qy^g	B.94 utt1	But you actually enjoy it,
na	A.95 utt1	Oh do.
na^r	A.95 utt2	I do.
bh	B.96 utt1	Do you?
na	A.97 utt1	I love it,
sv	B.98 utt1	Get out there on your hands and knees, and crawl around.
sd	A.101 utt1	I'd rather be doing that, than housework .
ba	B.102 utt1	I can imagine.
qy^d	B.102 utt2	You all have much trouble up there, with insects
ng	A.103 utt1	well, not a whole lot.
sd	A.103 utt2	I think our cabbages, and broccolis and that we have more trouble with, that type of thing, with the,
qy	B.104 utt1	With the worms?
ny	A.105 utt1	Yeah.
b^m	B.106 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.106 utt2	I have quite a bit of problem down here with the squash bugs, and haven't figured out how to get rid of those yet.
b	A.109 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.109 utt2	Do you go more for keeping them off naturally,
qrr	A.109 utt3	or do you, use insecticides?
ny	B.110 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.110 utt2	I try to,
nn	B.112 utt1	no
sd^e	B.112 utt2	I, try not to use any insecticides at all.
sd	B.112 utt3	I try not to even use insecticides on my lawn,
b	A.113 utt1	Uh huh.
b^r	A.113 utt2	Uh huh.
sd	B.114 utt1	but, sometimes I can't manage.
b	A.115 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.117 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.117 utt2	Well, our lawn, is a big lawn because we live out in the country,
sd	A.117 utt3	and so our lawn is not perfect, you know,
sd	A.117 utt4	it's just the it's just a lawn .
b	B.118 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.120 utt1	Well, mine's full of dandelions, now,
b	A.121 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.123 utt1	Do you eat any of them?
nn	B.124 utt1	No,
sd^e	B.124 utt2	I never have.
sd	B.124 utt3	I don't know how to prepare them.

nn	B.126 utt1	No.

sd	B.132 utt2	I've never eaten dandelions
sd	B.132 utt3	now I've tried dandelion wine
b	A.133 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.134 utt1	but I've never tried any dandelions just to eat.
ad	A.135 utt1	use the greens, if you get them when they're young and tender, you know, before they have grown too, too tall,
b	B.136 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.137 utt2	because they do get a little stringy.
aa	B.138 utt1	All right.
sd	A.139 utt1	But, they're kind of fun to try,
b	B.140 utt1	Yeah.
ad	A.141 utt1	get a few
ad	A.141 utt2	and then throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes.
aa	B.142 utt1	I'll try that.
b	A.143 utt1	Yeah.
b^r	A.143 utt2	Yeah.
aa	B.144 utt1	I sure will .
sd	A.145 utt1	but I've been cutting our grass too lately because my husband's back,

sd	A.145 utt3	so, wasn't allowed to run a lawn mower,
b	B.146 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.147 utt1	so, it takes about four hours to cut our grass.
ba	B.148 utt1	Yow.
sd	A.149 utt1	And, we have hills.
sd	A.149 utt2	I'm afraid of the hills
sd	A.149 utt3	but, I'm getting on to it,
bf	B.150 utt1	So you all are into, so you all are into the lawn, big time,
sd	A.151 utt2	I just pretend they're not there,
sd	A.151 utt3	and I just go ahead and do it .

sv	A.171 utt1	Well, you never have enough room do you think. Especially if your into any hobbies or anything.
aa	B.172 utt1	No.
sd	B.174 utt1	I have a question to ask you about gardening though.

sd^e	B.186 utt3	You find them under bricks and all that stuff, where it's moist,
sd	B.186 utt4	and if you touch them, they roll up in a ball.
bk	A.187 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.188 utt1	I don't know what they call them.
sd	B.188 utt2	But I'm plagued with those things,
sd	B.190 utt1	and I haven't figured out,
sd	B.190 utt2	I even called the nursery,
b	A.191 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.193 utt1	I'm trying to think of what they are, what kind, they could be.
sd	B.194 utt1	I, I don't know.
sd	A.197 utt1	You find them under bricks usually, and that.
b	B.198 utt1	Yeah,
b	B.198 utt2	under bricks, or under wood,
sv	B.198 utt3	or you know, if you leave a piece of newspaper in the yard too long, they get in there.
sv	B.198 utt4	They usually come out at night,
sv	B.198 utt5	but, you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up that's been laying around,
sd	A.199 utt1	They're not a slug.

sv	A.225 utt2	I think you have a lot more insects down there even than what we have.
sv	B.226 utt1	You know, I think it's a big problem because we're in more of a tempered zone.
