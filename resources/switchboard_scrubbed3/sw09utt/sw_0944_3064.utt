qy	A.1 utt1	Do you use credit cards a good bit?
na	B.2 utt1	I do,
sd	B.2 utt2	and I wish I didn't .
sd	B.4 utt1	Before I got married, about the only credit cards I used were gas cards, because I didn't like carrying, you know the cash with me all the time,
b	A.5 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.6 utt2	but I just never wanted to get into the hang up of using credit cards and having all those bills hanging over my head.
b	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.9 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.10 utt1	In fact, I remember getting my first MasterCard,
sd	B.10 utt2	and the only reason I got it was, you know, there was a while years ago when you couldn't cash a check without like a MasterCard or VISA
b	A.11 utt1	Okay.
b	A.13 utt1	Absolutely.
b	A.15 utt1	Right.
sd	B.16 utt1	And so that's why I went ahead and got one.
b	A.17 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.18 utt1	It was a mistake .
b	A.19 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.19 utt2	Well, actually, I have a whole wallet full of credit cards.
b	B.20 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.21 utt1	I don't use them very often.
sd	A.21 utt2	I try to use at least one gasoline credit card a week, and try to use a different one, so that, you know, I keep those active.
b	B.22 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.23 utt1	I have a half a dozen department store credit cards,
sd	A.23 utt2	and I'll use those if I need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick or something like that,
b	B.24 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.25 utt2	just enough to keep them active.
sd	A.25 utt3	My biggies are the VISA, MasterCard and Discover.
b	B.26 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.27 utt1	And for the most part, I had used those for like, charging airline tickets, where I can pay for those, you know, you could make the transaction over the telephone,
b	B.28 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.29 utt2	or I fly Southwest a good little bit, which means I can just run that card through the machine.
aa	B.30 utt1	That's right.
sd	A.31 utt1	and it saves a lot time.
sd	A.31 utt2	And that's what I was using it for.
sd(^q)	A.31 utt3	However, we had a, a very pressing financial family crisis, which said you have no alternative,
^q	A.31 utt4	you must have the money to do this with,
^q	A.31 utt5	and you do not have any other options
b	B.32 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.33 utt1	so I charged all three of those cards up,
sd	A.33 utt2	and right now I am paying and praying.
ba	B.34 utt1	I know how that goes
sd	B.36 utt1	and that's exactly what we've, I mean I have to say I have been thankful for them, because there were times when it was just like that when we had to have the money
b	A.37 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.39 utt1	Uh huh .
b	A.41 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.43 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.44 utt1	we had no way around it
b	A.45 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.46 utt1	and the only way to do it is go get, you know, an advance on a card
b	A.47 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.49 utt1	Uh huh .
sd	B.50 utt1	and so like you were paying for it,
sd	B.50 utt2	but it's one of those I'm glad it was there.
sd	A.51 utt1	Well, I never did, Right.
sd	A.53 utt2	I never did use it for an advance.
sd	A.53 utt3	Most of my charges were, medications.
b	B.54 utt1	I see.
sd	A.55 utt1	Didn't have cash for the medications
sd	A.55 utt2	or the doctor would accept MasterCard or VISA
b	B.56 utt1	Oh.
sv	A.57 utt1	And, a lot of times you can get by using those for,
sv	A.59 utt2	different labs will use those charge accounts for,
qy	B.62 utt1	Do you find now, though, that even some doctors won't?
^h	B.62 utt2	I've found some doctors that say, you know,
^h	B.62 utt3	I was so used to doctors or medical care places taking credit cards,
na	B.62 utt4	and so many of them don't anymore.
b	A.63 utt1	Uh huh .
sd	A.65 utt2	like I said, that was just one period in my life where that was critical.
b	B.66 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.67 utt1	I don't generally charge.
sd(^q)	A.67 utt2	I say well, I need a checkup in six months,
sd	A.67 utt3	and I kind of set that aside and just pay for it.
b	B.68 utt1	Right.
sd	A.69 utt2	I'm reimbursed on insurance anyway,
sd	A.69 utt3	and I can handle, you know, paying for it and waiting two or three weeks.
b	B.70 utt1	Right.
sv	A.71 utt1	Getting into a credit card fiasco is easy.
aa	B.72 utt1	it is .
sv	A.73 utt1	It is easy,
sv	A.73 utt2	and it's very difficult to get out.
sd	A.73 utt3	I just cringe every month when I see those interest charges.
aa	B.74 utt1	I know.
sd(^q)	A.75 utt1	I say wow,
^q	A.75 utt2	I ought to go to the credit union and borrow the money and pay this off.
^q	A.75 utt3	Big deal,
^q	A.75 utt4	I'm saving two percent.
b	B.76 utt1	Right.
sd	B.76 utt2	But, you know, the interest, even though it bothered me, it didn't used to bother me so much, because, of course, you could list it on a Schedule A
sd	B.76 utt3	and you got all your interest, you know towards your tax deductions,
b	A.77 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.79 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.80 utt2	and now they've messed that up to where it really is a financial burden to have to pay it.
b	A.81 utt1	Right.
sv	B.82 utt1	but it, but it is easy to get into a credit card problem,
sv	B.82 utt2	and I think about young people that think, you know,
sv(^q)	B.82 utt3	there's kind of that feeling of hey, it's so neat,
^q	B.82 utt4	I have my first credit card
b	A.83 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.84 utt1	and they just don't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments.
aa	A.85 utt1	yeah,
sv	A.85 utt2	and it's not just paying back what you've charged,
qh	B.86 utt1	You know.
sv	A.87 utt2	it's paying that and half again.
aa	B.88 utt1	That's right.
aa^r	B.90 utt1	That's right.
sv	A.91 utt1	you send in, fifty dollars,
sv	A.91 utt2	you're going to pay twenty, twenty five in interest charges.
aa	B.92 utt1	That's right.
sv	A.93 utt1	You only get half of that paid for the principal,
sd	A.93 utt2	so I'm looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts.
b	B.94 utt1	Right.
sd	A.95 utt1	Now, I mean as the monthly payment amount goes down, that will free up more cash where I can continue to make the larger payments.
b	B.96 utt1	Right.
sd	A.97 utt1	as long as I don't have a major disaster where I have to use it again, I can do that.
b	B.98 utt1	Right.
sd	A.99 utt1	Meantime, though, I'm not building any reserves.
aa	B.100 utt1	No,
sv	B.100 utt2	and that's frightening to me.
sd	A.101 utt1	Anything that I could be put aside into savings is going for interest on those cards.
aa	B.102 utt1	That's right.
ba	B.102 utt2	That's frightening, too.
b	A.103 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.104 utt1	I just, I, my husband is in business for himself
b	A.105 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.106 utt1	I work for T I
sd	B.106 utt2	but he doesn't
b	A.107 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.108 utt1	and, I, I've kind of got my fingers crossed.
sd	B.108 utt2	I've learned when you're in business for yourself, that you don't count on something until it's happened you know,
b	A.109 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.110 utt2	but you know, it's those once in a lifetime cases,
sd	B.110 utt3	and after ten years he's got two of them
b	A.111 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.112 utt1	and they should pay through next month,
sd(^q)	B.112 utt2	and we're both just looking at each other every night going man, that will pay off like both of our MasterCards, you know.
b	A.113 utt1	right,
b^r	A.113 utt2	right.
sd	B.114 utt1	And, you know, just in one lump,
sv	B.114 utt2	because that's the only way you can do it, is to have a big chunk of money
aa	A.115 utt1	Uh huh,
aa^r	A.115 utt2	uh huh.
sv	B.116 utt1	or it's like you say,
sv	B.116 utt2	you pay forever.
aa	A.117 utt1	Uh huh,
aa^r	A.117 utt2	uh huh.
sd	B.118 utt1	And so I'm really looking forward to that.
sv	A.119 utt1	Well, you either need a big chunk of money
sv	A.119 utt2	or you need a large reserve so that if you do charge on that account, you can make a single lump sum payment.
aa	B.120 utt1	That's right.
sv	A.121 utt2	Now, those are very handy
b	B.122 utt1	Right.
sv	A.123 utt1	if you have the reserves and you can make lump sum payments, sharp, good no problem
aa	B.124 utt1	Sure,
aa	B.124 utt2	yeah.
aa	B.126 utt1	I agree.
sd	A.127 utt1	because you're living on the other guy's money for a while.
aa	B.128 utt1	That's right .
sd	A.129 utt1	But I can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money .
aa	B.130 utt1	I know
sd	A.131 utt1	And it just irks me.
sd(^q)	A.131 utt2	I say my gosh, I had to work three hours just to pay the interest on this,
sd	A.131 utt3	and I've got three cards.
sd	A.131 utt4	I've lost a whole day of my life to interest.
aa	B.132 utt1	I know.
sv(^q)	B.132 utt2	You're like what am I working for today .
aa	A.135 utt1	Yeah,
aa^r	A.135 utt2	yeah.
sd	A.135 utt3	And that just blows my mind.
sd	A.135 utt4	my house is paid for,
sd	A.135 utt5	my car is paid for,
sd	A.135 utt6	I've got some home improvements,
sd	A.135 utt7	but even the payment on that doesn't equal the payment on one of those credit cards.
ba	B.136 utt1	It's incredible.
b	A.137 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.138 utt1	Boy, I wish I could say that my house and,
sd	B.138 utt2	well, my car is paid for now.
sd	B.138 utt3	It was wrecked three weeks ago,
sd	B.138 utt4	but you see again the credit cards came in handy.
b	A.139 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.140 utt2	I had to have the money to pay rental car, pay this, pay that till the insurance company pays back.
aa	A.141 utt1	That's right.
sv	A.141 utt2	I think that is a good, healthy, safe use of credit cards.
b	B.144 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.146 utt1	Because you know that's coming back to pay it off.
aa	A.147 utt1	Uh huh,
aa^r	A.147 utt2	uh huh.
sd	A.147 utt3	I went to a seminar,
sd(^q)	A.147 utt4	they said don't ever use your credit card for consumable items.
^q	A.147 utt5	You only use credit cards for investments.
b	B.148 utt1	Right.
sd(^q)	A.149 utt1	I said for crying out loud, if I had the money to in , you know, if I could do some investing, you'd have to invest at better than twenty percent earnings in order to pay for the payments on the credit card.
b	B.152 utt1	Sure.
aa	B.154 utt1	That's right.
sv	A.155 utt1	That doesn't make a bit of sense to me.
sd(^q)	A.155 utt2	I thought God dang, where is his pencil?
aa	B.156 utt1	That's right.
sv	B.158 utt1	Well, the smart half was don't pay it for consumables,
sv	B.158 utt2	you know, if you can't afford to go to a restaurant and eat out and pay cash, don't put it on a credit card you know,
aa	A.159 utt1	That's right.
sv	B.160 utt2	and so that is the smart half.
b	A.161 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.162 utt1	and I can remember before we had kids, we did that a lot,
sd	B.162 utt2	but it was no biggie you know, because we could pay it off,
b	A.163 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.164 utt2	while after kids, and you're paying child care and other things, all of a sudden it's not so easy to pay off,
sd	B.164 utt3	so we cut that out real quick .
b	A.165 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	A.165 utt2	uh huh.
sd	B.166 utt1	but I do like having them there.
sv	B.166 utt2	There is a bit of security in having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis, they are there to use
b	A.167 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.168 utt1	but you have to have a very good sense of saving, or common sense not to get yourself in trouble.
b	A.169 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.171 utt1	Uh huh .
sv	A.173 utt1	You also have to have that willingness to commit to that because you're committing a good portion of your life and income when you do it.
b	B.174 utt1	Uh huh.
