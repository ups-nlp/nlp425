o	A.1 utt1	Okay,
qw	A.1 utt2	what kind of car are you going to buy next?
sd	B.2 utt1	Well, one of the cars I'm thinking about buying next is, a nice, safe, small car,
sd	B.2 utt2	but, the reason being, is we just purchased a van a little while ago because we have a big family,
b	A.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.4 utt2	and we use that to get back and forth and haul kids around and so forth,
b	A.5 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.6 utt2	and we have another four door car that I drive to work,
sv	B.6 utt3	and I think it'd be more economical if I were able to a smaller car and, wouldn't cost much with gas.
b	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	A.9 utt1	That's true,
aa^r	A.9 utt2	that's true.
qw	B.10 utt1	what are you looking at?
nd	A.11 utt1	Well, I'm really not looking at anything for a while,
sv	A.11 utt2	but you know, when you're driving down the road you see all these pretty new ones that are out,
b	B.12 utt1	Uh huh.
sv(^q)	A.13 utt2	and you think, well, maybe I would like a new car.
b	B.14 utt1	yeah .
sd	A.15 utt1	But I think I'll be driving mine about two or three more years anyway.
b	B.16 utt1	yes,
b^r	B.16 utt2	yes.
sv	B.18 utt1	Well, the cost of new cars recently are extremely outrageous for the
aa	A.19 utt1	Right,
aa	A.19 utt2	they are.
sd	A.21 utt1	I sure do like the looks of that new Mitsubishi Diamante.
b	B.22 utt1	yes,
b^r	B.22 utt2	yes.
sv	A.23 utt1	That is a pretty car.
sd	B.24 utt1	I really like the looks also of the new Mazda that they have,
b	A.25 utt1	Uh huh,
sv	A.25 utt2	that's pretty, too.
sd	B.26 utt2	but you know, the costs of a new car and those new models are extremely out of our price range right now.
b	A.27 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.27 utt2	they get pretty expensive.
aa	B.28 utt1	Yes,
aa	B.28 utt2	they do.
sd	A.29 utt1	The last one I bought, I bought a,
sd	A.29 utt2	well, it's a Town Car,
sd	A.29 utt3	but it was a demo, returned
b	B.30 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.31 utt1	and I got it with like, you know, I think it was like fourteen thousand miles on it and nearly ten thousand dollars less than what the list price was.
b	B.32 utt1	Right.
sv	B.34 utt1	Well, you can't go wrong with that kind of opportunity.
sd	A.35 utt1	So I was really pleased to find that,
sd	A.35 utt2	then, I bought it for cheaper,
sd	A.35 utt3	I was looking at a Honda Accord, a brand new one
b	B.36 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.37 utt1	and I bought the, the Lincoln Town Car for just a little less money than what I was going to buy the new Honda Accord.
ba	B.38 utt1	Wow.
sv	B.38 utt2	Well, you get a much bigger, better comfortable ride.
sd	A.39 utt1	And the thing about it is they give you that ten, that hundred thousand mile, five year warranty where it only costs you twenty five dollars to have anything repaired.
b	B.44 utt1	Yes.
ba	B.46 utt1	Well, that's fantastic.
ba	B.46 utt2	That's real, real good.
sd	A.47 utt1	So, I have really been impressed.
sd(^q)	A.47 utt2	I said, I probably never be able, to find another one that I can afford, you know.
aa	B.50 utt1	No,
sd	A.51 utt1	But I have loved this car better than anything I've ever driven, because you can go on the road and get there
sd	A.51 utt2	and you're not even tired.
qy^g	B.52 utt1	Very comfortable, smooth ride,
sd	A.53 utt1	And it gets like twenty six miles to the gallon on the road.
bh	B.54 utt1	it does?
na	A.55 utt1	It sure does.
sv	B.56 utt1	that's unbelievable for that size of car.
sd	A.57 utt1	they kept telling me that,
sd(^q)	A.57 utt2	and I thought they're crazy,
sd	A.59 utt1	so well, actually before I signed the papers on it, I took it over to Boozier City
b	B.60 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.61 utt1	and it did it.
ba	B.62 utt1	Wow.
ba	B.62 utt2	That's great.
ba^r	B.64 utt1	That's great.
sd	B.64 utt2	That kind of gas mileage, we're kind of hoping for on our van.
b	A.65 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.65 utt2	Well, that's kind of what we've always been told, you know, they'll do,
sd	A.65 utt3	and then we hope for it,
sd	A.65 utt4	and it never happens
b	B.66 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.67 utt1	but it does get good gas mileage.
ba	B.68 utt1	Well, that's excellent.
sd	A.69 utt1	Most of the time when I don't go anywhere I can drive it for like three weeks to and from work, you know, and then fill it up,
b	B.70 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	B.70 utt2	do, does it, need a lot of repairs?
qy	B.70 utt3	Is it a very reliable kind of car?
sd	A.71 utt1	I haven't had anything,
sd	A.73 utt1	I've taken it in twice for like just really minor things,
sd	A.73 utt2	and it cost me the twenty five dollars.
sd	A.73 utt3	really something really silly when we first got it,
sd	A.73 utt4	we couldn't get the light,
sd	A.73 utt5	they have all these lights in the car
b	B.74 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.75 utt1	and it has this fancy little light that gives you a reading light for the passengers in the back seat
b	B.76 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.77 utt1	and we couldn't get the light to turn off.
sd	A.79 utt1	And we kept trying, you know,
sd	A.79 utt2	and we went out to dinner with some friends,
sd	A.79 utt3	and it stayed on all night, you know just shining right down on them, you know
ba	B.80 utt1	dear.
ba	B.82 utt1	dear .
sd	A.83 utt1	and we couldn't get it to turn off,
sd	A.83 utt2	and the next day my husband goes out there
sd	A.83 utt3	and he tries to get it off,
sd	A.83 utt4	we turn the knob, you know, in the front that's supposed to turn the lights on and off
b	B.84 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.85 utt2	and we turned everything we could,
b	B.86 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.87 utt2	and he took it in,
sd(^q)	A.87 utt3	and they said, you know, you just have to press the switch.
sd(^q)	A.87 utt4	He says, I've pressed every switch in that car,
^q	A.87 utt5	and I can't get the light off,
^q	A.89 utt1	it's broken.
b	B.90 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.91 utt1	So they took it in and charged us the twenty five dollars,
sd	A.91 utt2	and they called and told us though, that all you have to do is turn the off switch,
sd	A.91 utt3	and they showed us where the switch was.
bf	B.92 utt1	They charged you twenty five dollars just to tell you that,
aa	A.93 utt1	they thought there was really something wrong with it when he told them he had already done the switch.
b	B.94 utt1	Uh huh,
qy^d	B.94 utt2	so they probably went through the,
sd	A.95 utt1	But he hadn't done the right one.
b	B.96 utt1	I see .
sd	A.97 utt1	And it's right on the arm rest in the back
b	B.98 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.99 utt1	and we didn't know it was there.
b	B.100 utt1	okay.
sd	A.101 utt1	And the guy hit it with his arm when he got in the car
qy^d	B.102 utt1	And found it right away.
sd	A.103 utt1	and so we thought, you know, there was, it was broken.
b	B.104 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.105 utt2	I guess it's been in two times.
sd	A.105 utt3	I've had it three years now.
b	B.106 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.107 utt1	And, it's been in two, maybe three times.
sd	A.107 utt2	But it's just been real minor things.
sv	B.108 utt1	Well, I think that, you have an excellent deal then,
sv	B.108 utt2	and the company is able probably to offer that kind of warranty on the car because they know it's so well built that they don't expect any kind of major repairs whereas with an awful lot of other lower quality cars you would be getting repairs after repair after repair
aa	A.109 utt1	That's right.
b	A.111 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.112 utt1	and those companies wouldn't be able to afford that for that kind of extended warranty or warranty at all,
aa	A.113 utt1	That's right.
sd	A.113 utt2	But it's been an enjoyable car.
sd	A.113 utt3	Like I say, I'll probably never be able to have another one, because I think we bought it for about sixteen thousand, you know
b	B.114 utt1	Yes .
sv	A.115 utt1	and I said, I'll never find another one for that price.
aa	B.116 utt1	No,
aa	B.116 utt2	not at all.
sv	A.117 utt1	And they keep going up,
sd	A.117 utt2	so I'll have to enjoy it,
