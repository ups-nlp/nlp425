qy	A.1 utt1	Are you ready?
ny	B.2 utt1	Uh huh.
qy^t	A.3 utt1	She didn't announce that to you?
nd^t	B.4 utt1	I didn't quite hear all of it.
bk	A.5 utt1	I see.
ba	A.5 utt2	That's fine.
sv	A.5 utt3	I think, that's pleasurable for all of us, if we choose the right restaurant .
b	B.6 utt1	Right .
qw	A.7 utt1	So, what are your thoughts on dining out?
sd	B.8 utt1	Well, I really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else.
qy^d	A.9 utt1	Not for the price?
na	B.10 utt1	Well, a little bit for the price,
bk	A.11 utt1	Okay.
sd	B.12 utt2	but, I think that as far as quality of food goes some of the most expensive places I've been had the, really the, the worst quality of food.
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
bh	A.17 utt1	Really?
bk	A.17 utt2	Okay.
na^m	B.18 utt1	Really.
sd	B.18 utt2	a lot of places that even don't look like much.
b	A.19 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.20 utt1	some of the best food I have ever had was outside or inside of a place that we drove up
sd(^q)	B.20 utt2	and I was like, I'm not eating in there .
^q	B.22 utt1	Are you nuts?
sd	B.22 utt2	And, we went in
sd	B.22 utt3	and it was the most wonderful food.
ba	A.23 utt1	My word,
qy^g	A.23 utt2	it's like mama in the back kitchen, huh?
qy	B.24 utt1	Yeah.
bk	A.25 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.26 utt1	I'm serious.
b	A.27 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.28 utt1	one place that we went just recently was to Atchafalaya.
b	A.29 utt1	Uh huh.
ar	B.30 utt2	No,
ar	B.30 utt3	that's not right.
ar^r	B.32 utt1	That's not right.
ar^r	B.32 utt2	That's not right.
b	A.33 utt1	Okay.
t3	B.34 utt1	What's the name of that restaurant?
t3	B.34 utt2	Where at? .
t3	B.34 utt3	The Hari Krishna.
t3	B.34 utt4	Oh. Kalachandji's .
sd	B.34 utt5	Kalachandji's.
sd	B.34 utt6	It's all vegetarian,
sd	B.34 utt7	and it was just fabulous.
sd	B.34 utt8	I mean, my husband was aghast because I ate turnip greens and liked it.
ba	A.35 utt1	Wow.
qw	A.35 utt2	And where was that at, near your,
sd	B.36 utt1	Kalachandji's.
sd	B.36 utt2	it's a Hari Krishna run restaurant.
qw	A.37 utt1	Where,
qy	A.37 utt2	is it in Dallas?
ny	B.38 utt1	Yes.
qy	A.39 utt1	Is it in the phone book?
na	B.40 utt1	I think so.
sd	B.40 utt2	It should be.
qy	A.41 utt1	Do you know how to spell it?
sd	B.42 utt1	it starts with a K.
bk	A.43 utt1	Okay.
sd	B.44 utt1	So . K A L A, I think, C H A N D.
qy	A.45 utt1	Kalli , K A L L I?
bk	A.47 utt1	Okay.
sd	B.48 utt1	That should get you close enough to be able to find it.
sd	B.48 utt2	I think it's, probably listed in the restaurants, you know.
b	A.49 utt1	Uh huh,
b	A.49 utt2	section,
b	A.49 utt3	yes,
b^r	A.49 utt4	uh huh.
sd	B.50 utt1	But it's just fabulous food.
qo	A.51 utt1	What about fast foods?
qy	A.51 utt2	Do you have a preference if you were going to, eat a fast food?
na	B.54 utt1	Well, we like Arby's. As far as, fast food goes.
bh	A.55 utt1	You do, like Arby's?
sd	A.59 utt1	See I don't like Arby's.
bh	B.60 utt1	really?
qw	B.60 utt2	Why?
nn	A.61 utt1	No,
sv^e	A.61 utt2	because they use everything they can and make this into pressed whatever.
sv	A.61 utt3	they use the insides of the animals, heart and liver
sv	A.61 utt4	and they form it,
sv	A.61 utt5	and they make it look like roast beef,
sd(^q)	A.61 utt6	and I said, no,
^q	A.61 utt7	thank you.
ar	B.62 utt1	no,
ar^r	B.62 utt2	no,
ar^r	B.62 utt3	no.
sv	B.62 utt4	Someone has been lying to you.
sv	B.62 utt5	What they use is roast beef.
sd	A.63 utt1	Well, that's not what I heard, from somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about.
ba	B.66 utt1	my goodness.
b	A.67 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.68 utt1	I'm surprised.
sd	B.68 utt2	My dad worked for Arby's for several years.
bh	A.69 utt1	Really?
ny	B.70 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.71 utt1	Unless somebody is trying to blackball them.
sd	B.72 utt1	Well, that's happened before.
b	A.73 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.74 utt1	But w , we're, we like Mexican food.
bk	A.75 utt1	Okay.
sd	B.76 utt1	And stuff like that.
qo	A.77 utt1	How about the health food, restaurants? Well, like this one
qy^g	A.77 utt2	but it's probably not advertised as such, is it?
qy^h	B.78 utt1	A health food?
ny	A.79 utt1	Uh huh.
sd^e	A.79 utt2	Health food, restaurants that,
ad	B.80 utt2	name one .
aa	A.81 utt1	Well well, like, well, I can't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there's so few and far between.
sd	B.82 utt1	I'm not sure what you're talking about.
sd	A.83 utt2	But there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious. You know, as far as their cholesterol levels and their fat content and, you know, the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product
sd	A.83 utt3	and they list them.
sd	A.83 utt4	Now there's one restaurant that does that
sd	A.83 utt5	and it's called Rodolfo's
sd	A.83 utt6	over on Preston Road and Royal Lane I believe.
sd	A.85 utt1	And they have very good food over there.
sd	B.86 utt1	I don't guess I've ever been to anything like that
sd	B.86 utt2	so, I really don't have anything to compare it to.
b	A.87 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	A.87 utt2	uh huh.
sd	A.89 utt1	They do you know, list the fat,
sv	B.90 utt1	It would be good I think,
aa	A.91 utt1	Uh huh,
aa^r	A.91 utt2	uh huh.
qw^d	B.92 utt1	I don't know how expensive they are.
sv	B.92 utt2	It sounds like that it would probably,
sv	A.93 utt1	Well, it was pretty reasonable.
sd	A.93 utt2	it was around ten dollars for lunch. Okay,
sv	A.93 utt3	which is kind of high for lunch I guess.
qy	B.94 utt1	For one person?
ny	A.95 utt1	Yes.
bk	B.96 utt1	Oh .
ny^r	A.97 utt1	Yes,
ny	A.97 utt2	uh huh.
sv	B.98 utt1	A bit .
aa	A.99 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.99 utt2	but, you were served by maitre d's and, men waiters.
b	B.102 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.102 utt2	I won't really be interested in going there. Because, I feel like I'm paying, you know, five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that I could get along quite well without .
sv	A.103 utt1	Well, if you're looking for a nice,
b	A.107 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.107 utt2	Well, I guess if you were trying to impress somebody like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant. It's a special occasion, type thing.
aa	B.108 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.108 utt2	Maybe, maybe that.
aa	B.110 utt2	Yeah.
aa^m	B.112 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.112 utt2	I could see that, then maybe.
b	A.113 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.115 utt1	And now the Red Lobster I found is very nice at lunchtime.
aa	B.116 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.116 utt2	I like the, the seafood when they had it, you know, the broiled,
sv	A.119 utt2	you can't beat that price, if you went to a cafeteria.
aa	B.120 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.120 utt2	Probably that's true.
sv	B.120 utt3	But I know a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things, that you can't really get away from the fried,
sd	A.121 utt1	Well, I had the, I had a broiled chicken breast
sd	A.123 utt2	and it was excellent.
sd	A.123 utt3	It was a marinated, broiled chicken breast
sd	A.123 utt4	and it was exce ,
qw	B.124 utt1	Now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken?
sd	A.125 utt1	it was,
sd	B.126 utt1	That's one of my husband's pet peeves.
sd	B.126 utt2	He doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak, you know.
sd	@A.127 utt1	Well, I've never had catfish either in a restaurant because I'm from the north
sd	@A.127 utt2	and that was a no no.
bh	B.128 utt1	really?
sd	A.129 utt1	And I haven't gotten over that from the north.
sv	B.130 utt1	catfish is wonderful.
sd	A.131 utt1	I know they say that, that is,
b	B.132 utt1	really.
sd	A.133 utt2	but I'm, but they've got all these caution signs now on fish
b	B.134 utt1	Really.
sd	A.135 utt2	and so I kind of stay a ,
qw	B.136 utt1	Why?
sv	A.137 utt1	Because of all the pollution in the lakes and the, everywhere. I mean there isn't any safe haven anymore for fish.
bk	B.138 utt1	Oh.
sd(^q)	A.141 utt1	and especially, in Wisconsin and Michigan they say, no, buying of our fish.
sd	B.142 utt1	That's too bad, because I'm probably not going to stop eating it .
b	A.145 utt1	Well, yeah.
sv	A.145 utt3	and the best brand of chicken to buy is the, Pilgrim Pride because they don't use all these hormones to remote , unnatural growth in their products.
b	B.146 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.146 utt2	Yeah.
sv	A.147 utt1	So I mean, we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy.
aa	B.148 utt1	That's true.
sd	B.150 utt1	on one hand I see that
sd	B.150 utt2	and on the other hand, my older sister remembers when, at one point they were taking radioactive wastes and storing them in tin barrels which I guess, had a half life of, five years if they sit empty on dry land.
b	A.151 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.153 utt1	Yeah.
^2	A.155 utt1	Corrode.
sd	B.158 utt1	So they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically.
b	A.159 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.160 utt1	And then they take these things that will rust
sd	B.160 utt2	and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more.
sd	A.161 utt1	Well, I'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good.
b	B.162 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.162 utt2	And then they wouldn't think.
sd	B.162 utt3	They were floating around
sd	B.162 utt4	so they shot holes in them to sink them.
ba	A.163 utt1	dear.
sd	B.164 utt1	And this is before I was born.
ba	A.165 utt1	Wow.
sd	B.166 utt1	So, I mean we're taking thirty years ago, this happened,
b	A.167 utt1	Sure.
b	A.169 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.170 utt1	and you know, the tuna is radioactive to a certain extent.
aa	A.171 utt1	That's right.
sv	A.171 utt2	Everything we eat.
sv	A.173 utt1	Everything, everything we eat should have a label on it .
sv	B.174 utt1	You can't get away from it
b	A.177 utt1	Yeah.
b^m	B.178 utt1	yeah,
sv	B.178 utt2	you know. So you know, there's some things I think we, you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like, you know,
sv	B.178 utt3	this is not in my control.
sv	B.180 utt1	So I'm either going to starve to death
sv	B.180 utt2	or I'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as I possibly can, you know.
sv	A.181 utt1	Well, Becky, you know, even if you lived off your own land, that you would have to put caution signs,
