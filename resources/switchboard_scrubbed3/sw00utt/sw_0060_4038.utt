o	A.1 utt1	Okay,
sv	A.1 utt2	I guess it took,
sv^t	A.1 utt3	so I guess the recording has started now.
b	B.2 utt1	Yeah.
qy	B.4 utt1	So, have you ever served on a jury?
sd	A.5 utt1	I served,
sd	A.5 utt2	I was in the Air Force, and served on a court martial, board a couple of times, which is very similar to a jury.
sd	A.5 utt3	A lot of the same rules apply.
qy	A.5 utt4	Have you ever served on one?
ny	B.6 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.6 utt2	I finally served on one last year.
sd	B.6 utt3	I've, been voting for years,
sd	B.6 utt4	and I couldn't figure out why I hadn't been called yet
b	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.8 utt1	and I finally was.
sv	B.8 utt2	So it was an interesting experience.
sv*	B.8 utt3	I was kind of boring. / * listen; should I be "it"
qr	A.9 utt1	Was it civil or criminal?
sd	B.10 utt1	it was, it was, well, let's see, it was municipal court
qrr	A.11 utt1	A grand jury or,
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.14 utt1	so it was a combination of,
sd	B.14 utt2	and I was in the pool for a couple of weeks
b	A.15 utt1	I see.
sd	B.16 utt1	so it was a combination of criminal and civil,
sd	B.16 utt2	and they had,
sd	B.16 utt3	well most of the time we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors
b	A.17 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.18 utt1	and then, it was always exciting when we got called to, to go, because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides, just sit in the jury room.
b	A.19 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.19 utt2	did the judge, hand down sentences
qrr	A.19 utt3	or did you folks do that?
ny	B.20 utt1	yeah,
sd^e	B.20 utt2	the judge did.
sd	B.20 utt3	I had a hard time getting seated on a jury.
sd	B.20 utt4	I kept getting,
sd	B.20 utt5	I'd be questioned, for empaneling the jury,
sd	B.20 utt6	and they kept, dismissing me.
b	A.21 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.24 utt1	Course they don't have to give a reason,
sd	B.24 utt2	but it's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like, you know,
aa	A.25 utt1	No.
sv	B.26 utt2	they want to get the best, mix for their case,
sv	B.26 utt3	so they ask all kinds of wild questions.
sv	A.27 utt1	That that's a science in itself.
b	B.30 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.30 utt2	well I kept getting called up for drunk driving questions,
sv	B.30 utt3	and I think part of it was they didn't like the fact that I don't drink any more.
b	A.31 utt1	Uh huh,
b	A.31 utt2	I see.
bf	A.33 utt1	Because you'd probably be, too puritanical
aa	B.34 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.34 utt2	that was probably it,
sv	B.36 utt2	although in my case I might have been more, sympathetic with the person who got caught,
h	B.36 utt3	I don't know.
b	A.37 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.39 utt1	So, were the, sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair,
qrr	A.39 utt2	or would,
qy	A.39 utt3	if you were deciding, do you think that they would have been different.
^h	B.40 utt1	Well, I was never there for any sentencing.
sd	B.40 utt2	I finally got empaneled on one case, on my next to the last day,
sd	B.40 utt3	and, we got into the, jury room to, decide the case,
sd	B.40 utt4	and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate, because he'd already decided that the guy was, not guilty,
sd	B.40 utt5	and he would never vote for guilty.
sd	B.42 utt1	So, they appointed me jury foreman
sv	B.42 utt2	and I, didn't think that, going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict,
sd	B.42 utt3	so I told the judge that we were unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate.
sd	B.44 utt1	So the whole thing had to be tried over again.
ba	A.45 utt1	Wow,
sv	A.45 utt2	I bet that made him happy.
aa	B.46 utt1	Yeah.
aa^r	B.46 utt2	Yeah,
sv	B.46 utt3	it was funny.
h	B.46 utt5	I, I don't know,
sd	B.46 utt6	I didn't, I didn't like not being able to deliberate.
b	A.47 utt1	Right.
sd	B.48 utt1	I, I wanted to vote guilty for the guy,
sd	B.48 utt2	and the other people were kind of mixed
b	A.49 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.50 utt1	so, the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again.
sv	B.50 utt2	Cost him a lot of money,
sv	B.50 utt3	I'm sure.
b	A.51 utt1	Yeah.
qw	A.51 utt2	how many members were on the jury?
qr	A.51 utt3	Was it a six or twelve member jury?
sd	B.52 utt1	it must have been six.
b	A.53 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.54 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.55 utt1	That's kind of curious to me.
sd	A.55 utt2	I didn't realize until the, Wayne Kennedy Smith trial, a few months ago that they had six member juries.
sd	A.55 utt3	I thought that you know, it was always twelve men tried and true, so to speak.
sv	A.57 utt1	But, apparently for some crimes, it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment.
sd	A.59 utt1	I know on a ,
sd	A.59 utt2	getting to this unanimous thing, whether, you know, a jury should be unanimous or not, in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous.
sd	A.59 utt3	It's a simple majority, you know, rules.
b	B.60 utt1	Yeah.
h	B.60 utt2	Well, let's see,
qy	B.62 utt2	is it on, capital crimes that they have to be unanimous
na	A.63 utt1	Probably on capital,
h	A.63 utt2	I don't know,
sd	A.63 utt4	the two that I were on had to do with drugs
b	B.64 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.65 utt1	and, we were, unanimous is acquitting the person, even though we in our, gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of various things,
sd	A.65 utt2	the government really failed to prove its case,
sd	A.65 utt3	and, you know, being fair to the person, if the government doesn't prove its case, no matter how you feel, you have to go by what's offered as proof,
sd	A.65 utt4	and we had to acquit him in both cases.
qy^d	B.66 utt1	it was too circumstantial?
ny	A.67 utt1	yeah,
sd^e	A.67 utt2	it was, yeah, in some of the critical things, like special investigations, at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person,
sd	A.67 utt3	but something happened to the camera and the tape and
sd	A.69 utt1	all they could do was testify,
