^h	A.4 utt1	Well, it's funny, when I tried, to make the call the other days,
sd	A.6 utt2	I thought,
sd	A.8 utt1	I hadn't seen anything since DANCES WITH WOLVES
sd	A.8 utt2	but today I went to see REGARDING WITH HENRY.
sd	B.9 utt1	I'm dying to see that.
sv	A.10 utt1	It was really good.
b	B.11 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.12 utt1	Jeff Wariner just got out of the hospital
b	B.13 utt1	Uh huh .
sd	A.14 utt1	and, Jeff and Deeanna went and another friend in the neighborhood,
sd	A.14 utt2	and, we all liked it.
sd	A.14 utt3	We had both moms and, fifteen year olds and a twelve year old
sd	A.14 utt4	and everyone enjoyed it.
ba	B.15 utt1	my goodness.
sd	B.17 utt1	well I am just dying to see it.
sd	B.17 utt2	I went to dinner with some friends last weekend
sd(^q)	B.17 utt3	and they said get a baby sitter
^q	B.17 utt4	and we'll all go see REGARDING HENRY
b	A.18 utt1	Yeah.
sd(^q)	B.19 utt1	and I said, ooh, I want to see it so bad.
sd	A.20 utt1	Well, my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer, on, choir tour and visiting friends and one thing and another. A lot of the ones I had wanted to see
b	B.21 utt1	Oh.
sd(^q)	A.22 utt2	and so since he had this friend up from Houston, and his friend had already seen so many and I thought they decided on this and I thought well, I want to see this one, too.
b	B.23 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.24 utt2	finally, it's my first summer movie .
ba	B.25 utt1	my.
^h	B.25 utt2	Well, let me see.
qy	B.25 utt3	Was it,
sd	B.25 utt4	well, we went to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS last weekend
sv	B.25 utt5	and that may be,
ar	B.25 utt6	no,
sd(^q)	B.25 utt7	right before I went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on,
^q	B.25 utt8	we're going to the movies.
sd	B.25 utt9	And we won't,
sd	B.25 utt10	well she goes all the time
sd	B.25 utt11	but I go maybe once every couple of months.
b	A.26 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.27 utt1	And when I go, I go see two at a time.
sd	B.27 utt2	So we went to see SOAPDISH,
qy	A.28 utt1	was that good?
sv	B.29 utt1	hysterical.
sd	B.29 utt2	We laughed so hard,
sd	B.31 utt1	it was just, you couldn't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing so hard.
b	A.32 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.34 utt1	Well, I want to see that and CITY SLICKERS both.
sd	A.34 utt2	I love comedies.
b	B.35 utt1	Yeah
sd	A.36 utt2	But, that's what I was ,
sd	B.37 utt1	that's the other one that we went to that night.
bh	A.38 utt1	was it?
sd	B.39 utt1	And, my face hurt so bad, from laughing because I love Billy Crystal.
sv	B.43 utt2	And course, growing up on the back of a horse, you know, and being on ranches and stuff, so much of that was so true
sd	B.43 utt3	and I was absolutely rolling in the aisles.
sv	B.43 utt4	It was so funny.
sv	B.43 utt5	Both of them were great.
ba	A.44 utt1	well good.
sd	A.44 utt2	I'm glad to hear that because they,
aa	B.45 utt1	they are
sd	B.45 utt2	we just laughed so hard.
sv	B.45 utt3	And like I said, I mean with SOAPDISH, it is so cornball
sv	B.45 utt4	and it is so overacted that you're just hysterical you know.
b	A.46 utt1	Uh huh .
sv	B.47 utt2	they just carried it off, to the tee.
qy^d	A.50 utt1	Well, I don't know if you got to see WEEKEND, AT BERNIE'S that was out a couple of year's ago.
nn	B.51 utt1	No.
sd	A.52 utt2	They had a free showing at the Berkeley, United Artist.
ba	B.53 utt1	How neat.
sd	A.54 utt1	And, I don't know who was here or whether Jay called a friend
sd	A.54 utt2	and we didn't think we'd have much chance of getting in
sd	A.54 utt3	but we thought we'd try it, you know, free movie.
fe	B.55 utt1	Shoot,
aa	B.55 utt2	yeah.
sv	A.56 utt1	It was so funny and it sounds like, what you were just describing, SOAPDISH, too.
sd	A.56 utt2	I mean, we hurt by the time we came out.
b	B.57 utt1	yeah.
sd	A.58 utt1	And the whole theater was hysterical
sv	A.58 utt2	and it's just goofy.
ad	A.58 utt4	if you have a chance to rent it, at least,
sv	A.58 utt5	or it should be out on T V, I would think,
aa	B.59 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.59 utt2	I think it is.
sv^r	B.59 utt3	I think it is.
sv	A.60 utt1	cause it's just a fun summer light comedy,
sv	A.60 utt2	make your cheeks hurt laughing.
sd	A.60 utt3	Especially in the theater it was contagious, you know
b	B.61 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.62 utt1	I imagine the way SOAPDISH was, but, with everyone laughing.
ba	B.63 utt1	gosh
sd	B.65 utt1	I never laughed.
sd	B.65 utt2	And people were just screaming and applauding
sv	B.65 utt3	and, you know, it was just hysterical.
sd	A.66 utt1	Well, I'm glad you did that before your surgery .
sd	B.67 utt1	me too, because I don't even know if I could live through it now.
b	A.68 utt1	Yeah .
sd	B.69 utt1	I mean I'm getting around real good
sd	B.69 utt2	and I'm just still real sore.
b^r	A.70 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.71 utt1	And today I, course I went back to work two weeks after,
ba	A.72 utt1	gosh.
sd	B.73 utt1	but see I don't have permanent work.
sd	B.73 utt2	right now I'm working with a temporary agency.
sd	B.73 utt3	And so, the second week I was out of the hospital I went up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software for free.
b	A.74 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.75 utt1	so I went up to do WordPerfect cause that seems like that's what everybody wants,
sd	B.75 utt2	and I was up there half a day and came home and collapsed.
b	A.76 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.77 utt1	And then they called me to see if I wanted to work a day.
sd(^q)	B.77 utt2	And I said, yeah,
sd	B.77 utt3	and I went
sd	B.77 utt4	and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that.
sd	B.77 utt5	And, I worked about three days a week ever since, two to three days a week.
sd	B.77 utt6	And so I went to my doctors last Thursday,
sd	B.79 utt1	and this was my fourth week checkup
sd(^q)	B.79 utt2	and he said well gosh, you're just healing really well,
^q	B.79 utt3	I just can't get over this.
sd(^q)	B.79 utt4	He says, in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things.
^q	B.79 utt5	If you want to play ball, you can go play ball.
sd(^q)	B.79 utt6	He says, now I'm not going to say you're going to feel like playing ball
^q	B.79 utt7	but you can if you want to.
b	A.80 utt1	Yeah .
sd	B.81 utt2	And, you know, he was teasing me
sd(^q)	B.81 utt3	and he says, yeah,
^q	B.81 utt4	you'll be out there waterskiing,
^q	B.81 utt5	I can just see it now.
sd(^q)	B.83 utt1	And, he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks.
^q	B.83 utt2	You've only got two more weeks.
sd(^q)	B.83 utt3	I said okay fine, I will, I will .
^q	B.83 utt4	Whatever you call easy, I'll do it, you know.
sd	B.83 utt5	and I've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it.
b	A.84 utt1	Yeah.
b^r	A.84 utt2	Yeah .
sd	B.85 utt1	And so, I'm real glad that we didn't go see those funny ones when I'm still sort of on the sore side.
b^r	A.86 utt1	Yeah .
qw	B.87 utt2	well, what's your next,
qy	B.87 utt3	have you seen ROBIN HOOD yet?
nn	A.88 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.88 utt2	that was one, Jay got to see with a friend
sd	A.90 utt1	and to try and find time it's hard, with Jim's schedule, too, just to get a time that we can both go.
b	B.91 utt1	yeah.
sd	A.92 utt1	And, I'm holding out for CITY SLICKERS for the two of us because, we had friends that went to see that and said, you know, it's just perfect for our age group
b	B.93 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.94 utt1	because I think he needs a comedy, too.
sd	A.94 utt2	and that's what he would have liked to have seen REGARDING HENRY, too,
sv	A.94 utt4	we've got a lot of company this summer, which is wonderful.
sd	A.94 utt5	We're really enjoying it
sd	A.94 utt6	but some of the different things we're doing, there's just not enough time to do it all
b^r	B.95 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.96 utt2	and he said, well, realistically , You know, he knew he couldn't get them all in.
b	B.97 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.98 utt2	But, Jay really liked ROBIN HOOD.
sd	A.98 utt3	when the choir group went to see BACKDRAFT and they thought it was funny cause he sounded like the critics.
sd	A.98 utt4	He said, you know the plot line and the characters, you know aren't real big
sd	A.98 utt5	but the fire scenes and the dra , you know that action part is fantastic.
b	B.99 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.100 utt2	But, he thought ROBIN HOOD was great.
sv	A.100 utt3	It was real different then you'd expect,
sd	A.100 utt4	but h but he enjoyed it
bh	B.101 utt1	really?
sd	B.103 utt1	Well I went,
sd	B.103 utt2	course I am a Kevin Costner fan.
b	A.104 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.104 utt2	me too.
b	A.104 utt3	And yeah,
sd	B.105 utt1	Supreme.
sd	A.106 utt2	I really, like him a lot. Which is why, DANCES WITH WOLVES was the last movie we had seen for several months
b	B.107 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.109 utt1	Gosh, was that wonderful.
aa	A.110 utt1	It was,
sd	A.110 utt3	in fact, a friend from Germany was visiting in March
sd	A.110 utt4	and we didn't, ran out of time, we wanted to take him to see it.
sd	A.110 utt5	We were going to sit through it again cause we really wanted him to see it, too.
b	B.111 utt1	yeah.
sv	A.112 utt1	I just thought that was terrific.
sd	A.112 utt2	And I really enjoy Harrison Ford which is one of the reasons I wanted to see,
aa	B.113 utt1	I do, too.
sv	B.113 utt2	I think he's really good.
sv	A.114 utt1	And he's very good in REGARDING HENRY.
sv	A.114 utt2	That's not an easy part to play, I don't think .
aa	B.115 utt1	I wouldn't think.
sd	B.115 utt2	Well, my kids are going to their Dad's tomorrow night
sd	B.115 utt3	so I sort of think I may go do that.
b	A.116 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.116 utt2	that one won't your sides .
ba	B.117 utt1	Good .
qy	A.118 utt2	was this the first time you got to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS?
sd	B.119 utt2	my parents took me when I was probably somewhere between Ashley and Jamie's age .
b	A.120 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.121 utt1	And we went to the,
