sv	B.1 utt1	Well, I myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in specific, very specific in this, very specific examples such as, transportation workers, as in, air traffic controllers, bus drivers and that kind of thing.
nd	A.2 utt1	Well.
sv	B.3 utt1	I don't really think that it's, too many,
sv	B.3 utt2	I think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say, well, we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're, you know, worthy of working for us.
sv	B.3 utt3	I really don't see that that's a very valid, thing for a company to say,
sv	B.3 utt4	and personally, I don't think I would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body.
aa	A.4 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.4 utt2	I guess I basically agree that,
qy	A.4 utt3	do you think it's okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they'll take drugs?
qy^d	A.4 utt4	I mean suppose they found out some other way?
sv	B.5 utt1	Well, I think I think the problem here is that a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs.
b	A.6 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.7 utt1	There's too many cases where it can, you know,
sv	B.7 utt2	there can be false positive results, and that sort of thing.
sv	B.7 utt3	I don't think there's any definitive, you know,
^q	B.7 utt4	okay this person is taking drugs,
^q	B.7 utt5	so we don't want him here.
b	A.8 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.9 utt1	like I said, some industries, though, I think it'd be very necessary,
sd	B.9 utt2	I wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when I'm flying in an airplane.
b^r	A.10 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.11 utt1	But, I just, I find it to be pretty offensive that it's such a big deal.
sd	B.11 utt2	I mean, if your employer's not going to trust you
sv	B.11 utt4	I think it's a whole trust issue.
sv	B.11 utt5	I just can't see it.
qy	A.12 utt1	But, have you ever been in a situation where you were drug tested
ny	B.13 utt1	yeah,
sd^e	B.13 utt2	I have been.
b	A.14 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.15 utt1	I. I mean, I was very offended by the whole process.
sd	A.16 utt1	I once too,
b	A.18 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.19 utt1	I mean it's very humiliating,
sd	B.19 utt2	and, I mean, I'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs,
sv	B.19 utt3	but I am totally against that sort of a,
sv(^q)	B.19 utt4	I mean it's a pretty personal thing when somebody says I want to look at your urine before I'm going to talk to you.
b	A.20 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.20 utt2	I had it during a job interview,
sv	A.20 utt3	and I just thought it was dumb of the company, at a point where they were trying to convince me to want to work for them to do this,
b	B.21 utt1	Right.
sd(^q)	A.22 utt2	and I'm just like, well, I'm not even going to think much about it if you're going to treat me with this much respect even before you've gotten to know me.
b	B.23 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.25 utt1	Right.
b^r	B.27 utt1	Right.
sd	B.27 utt2	that's basically my opinion on it, right there, is that it's just, you know,
sd	B.27 utt3	I, I was in the same sort of situation as,
sd	B.27 utt4	it was a job interview
sd	B.27 utt5	and then you had a physical, where you were drug tested,
sd	B.27 utt8	and I know people who have been drug tested and who have not, you know, been hired by a corporation which, you know,
sv	B.27 utt10	The other side of it is, besides its being an invasion of personal privacy, it's my bodily fluid
sd	B.27 utt11	and I don't really want you to look at it, or or something pretty basic like that,
b	A.28 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.29 utt2	just to the fact that I don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what it's employees are doing when they're not at work.
sv(^q)	B.29 utt3	I mean, during the eight hours, during the day, when they're supposed to be there, I think they have every right to say these behaviors are acceptable and these are not,
sv	B.29 utt4	but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work, I find that to be fairly offensive also.
b	A.30 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.30 utt2	well like you say, I mean, if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt, then really I mean, the, the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors.
b	B.31 utt1	Right.
b^r	B.33 utt1	Right.
sv	A.34 utt1	And, I mean, if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem, then they'll notice it for other reasons.
aa	B.35 utt1	That's exactly right.
b	A.36 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.37 utt1	And also I just think it gets a lot,
sd	B.37 utt2	I'm a big, supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies,
sv	B.37 utt3	and I think that it just moves down along a line that I really would find bad if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work, you know,
sd	B.37 utt4	there's already talk of people,
^q	B.37 utt5	well, we're not going to hire you if you smoke.
sd(^q)	B.39 utt1	Well, you know, I can see how they can say in the work place you don't want them to smoke,
sv	B.39 utt2	but when somebody leaves work, I don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their life style at all.
qy	A.40 utt1	Well, do you think it's, should be illegal for an employer to do this
na	B.41 utt1	I really think it should be, except as I've mentioned twice now, in the specified industries or jobs, because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times.
b	A.42 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.43 utt2	And other than that I do not think it should be allowable.
sv	B.43 utt3	I think it should be illegal for them to want to do that.
sv	B.43 utt4	it's kind of the big brother syndrome,
sd	B.43 utt6	anything like that just kind of scares me.
sd	A.44 utt1	I tend to view it,
sv	A.44 utt2	even though I don't think I'd work for a company that did that, I sort of want to defend an employer's rights in addition to an individual's rights,
sv	A.44 utt3	but an employer, really, I think, has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to
b	B.45 utt1	Right.
sv	A.46 utt1	and if they say they don't want smokers, I sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that.
b^r	B.47 utt1	Right.
