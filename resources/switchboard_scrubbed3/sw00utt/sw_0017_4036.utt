sv	A.1 utt1	I think that, one, advantage of having, the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't, convict someone who, really shouldn't be convicted.
aa	B.2 utt1	Definitely.
sv	A.3 utt1	and I think that, you know, a unanimous verdict, helps to ensure that.
sv	A.3 utt2	I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way, that, you, would have a problem, you know, that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted.
b	B.4 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.5 utt1	Have you ever served on a jury before?
na	B.6 utt1	I have twice.
bk	A.7 utt1	okay.
sv	B.8 utt1	It was a pretty wild experience.
qw	A.9 utt1	what sorts of cases were they?
sd	B.10 utt1	They were just, you know, small time cases where, trailers and banks were involved, you know.
qr	A.11 utt1	So were they criminal or civil?
sd	B.12 utt1	They were civil.
sd	B.12 utt2	They weren't they weren't any criminal.
bk	A.13 utt1	okay.
qw	A.15 utt1	what was the verdict?
qy	A.15 utt2	did the jury have trouble reaching a decision?
sd	B.16 utt1	the jury, let me see, I think it was ten to one on the jury, because they only had to have eleven people
b	A.17 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.18 utt3	and, the one changed his vote at the end.
qy	A.19 utt1	So did it become?
sd	B.20 utt1	So it became unanimous, you know, after they turned it in
b	A.21 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.22 utt1	and then he changed his mind after they turned it in
sd	B.24 utt1	but it then became unanimous.
qy^g	A.25 utt1	But since it was a civil case it really didn't matter, right?
qy^d	A.25 utt2	You just needed a majority?
aa	B.26 utt1	Right.
qw	A.27 utt1	what was the other case?
qy^d	A.27 utt2	That was also civil?
sd	B.28 utt1	the other case was just traffic,
sd	B.28 utt3	and, you know, it was seat belt law
b	A.29 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.30 utt1	and it didn't even hardly go through,
^2	A.31 utt1	didn't really even count.
b	A.33 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.33 utt2	I'm a college student
sd	A.33 utt3	so I haven't been, you know, a jury eligible age for very long
b	B.34 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.35 utt1	and, I did get one summons actually at one point,
sd	A.35 utt2	but I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student, because it was, a very bad time.
b	B.36 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.36 utt2	Well, you learn a lot going to the juries like that though.
sd	A.37 utt1	Yeah, I mean, I really, I would like to do at some point,
sd	A.37 utt2	but, I haven't.
sv	A.37 utt3	one thing that I think you know, maybe is a problem is, I think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now,
sv	A.37 utt4	but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well.
sv	B.38 utt1	I wouldn't think that it does I mean, from my, from what I experienced in them,
sd	B.40 utt2	you know, it didn't turn out the way I planned it, I mean, the way that I would think that it would go.
qy^d	A.41 utt1	you thought it turned out pretty well?
ny	B.42 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.42 utt3	jury was unorganized
sd	B.42 utt4	and it was just wasn't organized enough for me.
b	A.43 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.44 utt1	I'm not used to it not being organized,
sd	B.44 utt2	and I just assumed that it would have been.
bf	A.45 utt1	so it was just kind of a zoo
bf	A.45 utt2	and the jurors just sort of,
qy^d	A.45 utt3	someone had to figure out what was going on?
aa	B.46 utt1	That's about what it was.
sv	A.47 utt1	That's interesting.
qy	A.47 utt2	did it work out pretty well in the end?
qy	A.47 utt3	I mean, did a couple of people sort of gradually, sort of assume, sort of a moderator role in the trial
ny	B.48 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.48 utt2	well they picked one person,
sd	B.48 utt3	and then he finally, you know, moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have.
qy^d	A.49 utt1	So it did end up working out pretty well?
ny	B.50 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.50 utt2	it ended up working all right.
sv	A.51 utt1	The one thing I sometimes wonder about, in civil cases is, whether, especially sort of in, maybe like product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes
b	B.52 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.53 utt1	you know, it's not just a matter of, you know, did this guy rip off this guy,
sd	A.53 utt2	and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract,
sv	A.53 utt3	it's sort of a matter of, you know, sometimes getting into very technical issues,
sv	A.53 utt4	and I wonder if there's really, if the system works adequately in educating the jurors about, whatever, you know, issue is under discussion.
sv	B.54 utt1	I don't think that they, they educate them enough to really know what's going on.
sd	A.55 utt1	in the case you were involved in, you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind.
b	B.56 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.56 utt2	the bank was suing them because they went to get the trailer which was, seemingly their property.
b	A.57 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.60 utt1	It was on his property.
bf	A.61 utt1	so the deal was that he had, borrowed money from the bank to buy it,
bf	A.61 utt2	and he hadn't made the payments.
aa	B.62 utt1	Right.
sd	B.64 utt1	So they came to get it.
b	A.65 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.66 utt1	And then when they came to get it, well, it was on the landlord's property
sd	B.66 utt2	and he wouldn't let them take it off.
bf	A.67 utt1	so they were suing to get it back.
sd	B.68 utt1	and it was a double wide,
sd	B.68 utt2	so they'd already taken it apart.
sd	B.70 utt1	So they left it there
b	A.71 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.72 utt1	and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it.
sd	B.74 utt1	So they were suing him for the money,
sd	B.74 utt2	and, you know, there's no way they could because it was the moving company,
