o	A.1 utt1	Okay.
qw	A.1 utt2	So, What kind of experience do you have, then with child care?
qy^d	B.2 utt1	I guess, I think, I wonder if that worked.
qy	A.5 utt1	Does it say something?
sd	B.6 utt1	I think it usually does.
ad	B.6 utt2	You might try,
h	B.6 utt3	I don't know,
ad	B.6 utt4	hold it down a little longer,
ad	B.6 utt5	and see if it,
aa	A.7 utt1	Okay .
qy	A.7 utt2	Well, Does it usually make a recording or s ,
b	B.8 utt1	Okay
sd	B.8 utt2	I, Well, I don't remember.
sd	B.10 utt2	It seemed like it did,
sd	B.10 utt3	but it might not.
sv	B.10 utt4	I guess I guess we can start.
bk	A.11 utt1	Okay.
aa	A.13 utt1	Okay.
nn	B.14 utt1	No,
sd^e	B.14 utt2	I don't have any kids.
sd	B.14 utt3	my sister has a, she just had a baby,
sd	B.14 utt4	he's about five months old
sd	B.14 utt5	and she was worrying about going back to work and what she was going to do with him and the different,
b	A.15 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	B.16 utt2	do you have kids?
na	A.17 utt1	I have three.
bh	B.18 utt1	really?
ny	A.19 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.21 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.21 utt2	I do .
sd	A.21 utt4	I don't work, though,
sd	A.21 utt5	but I used to work when I had two children.
b	B.22 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.23 utt1	I work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit,
sd	A.23 utt2	but I don't envy anybody who's in that situation to find day care.
b	B.24 utt1	Yeah.
qy	A.25 utt1	But, does your sister live in a big community?
ny	B.26 utt1	yeah
sd^e	B.26 utt2	she lives,
sd	B.26 utt3	it's a fairly large community.
sd	B.26 utt4	She, got real lucky, though.
sd	B.26 utt5	He had a boss who, moved into a larger office
b	A.27 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.28 utt1	and she's able to take her baby to work with her.
bh	A.29 utt1	really?
sd	B.30 utt1	And it's a small office that she works in
b	A.31 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.32 utt1	and, it's a legal office,
sd	B.32 utt2	and it's just one lawyer
sd	B.34 utt1	and so she's the only one really that takes care of the office.
sd	B.34 utt2	There's no one else that works there.
b	A.35 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.36 utt1	And so they have an extra room and everything for the baby,
sd	B.36 utt2	so it works out pretty good for her.
ba	A.37 utt1	Wow.
ba	A.39 utt1	How lucky .
sd	A.39 utt2	I know a lot of people around here sometimes have, like, mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids
b	B.40 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.41 utt2	but, the community I'm in is not a real large one,
sd	A.41 utt3	so there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that, you know,
sd	A.41 utt4	you either know them or know somebody who knows them , to get to,
b	B.42 utt1	Yeah,
bf	B.42 utt2	so it's fairly safe.
aa	A.43 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.43 utt2	to get references and that,
sd	A.43 utt4	I don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center, simply because there's so many kids and so many ,
qy	B.44 utt1	Worried that they're not going to get enough attention?
ny	A.45 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.45 utt2	and, you know, colds and things like that get spread real easy and things,
b	B.46 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.47 utt2	and they're expensive
sd	A.47 utt3	and, course, there's a lot of different types of day care available, too, you know, where they teach them academic things.
aa	B.48 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.49 utt1	Or they just watch them and let them play and things like that,
sv	A.49 utt3	take a long time to find the right place
aa	B.50 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.50 utt2	and you don't always even know if it's going to be the right place or not.
b	A.51 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.52 utt1	Anything, I guess, could happen.
b	A.53 utt1	Uh huh.
qy^d	B.54 utt1	I guess after he, you know, gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care.
ny	A.55 utt1	Uh huh,
sd^e	A.55 utt2	when he starts toddling around and stuff.
b	B.56 utt1	Yeah.
b^m	A.57 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.58 utt1	when he's not, when she can't keep control of him
sd	B.58 utt2	and he starts crawling
aa	A.59 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.59 utt2	It would be hard,
sv	A.59 utt3	I think it would be kind of stressful.
sv	A.59 utt4	It would be nice to have him around
b	B.60 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.61 utt1	but, seems like, you know,
fe	A.61 utt2	goll ,
qh	A.61 utt3	what if he cried at the wrong time
"	A.61 utt4	or the phone rang you know, at the wrong time .
b	B.64 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.66 utt1	I think she has problems with that, too.
b	A.67 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.67 utt2	Well, when you have kids, will you work?
qy	A.67 utt3	Do you work now?
no	B.68 utt1	I don't know
sd	B.70 utt1	that's something I've considered.
b	A.71 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.72 utt1	I always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time.
b	A.73 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	B.74 utt1	Is that what you do?
ny	A.75 utt1	yeah.
sd^e	A.75 utt2	Actually, I teach my kids at home,
sd	A.75 utt3	so I'm here all the time.
bf	B.76 utt1	so they don't go to school.
qy	B.76 utt2	Is it like,
t1	B.76 utt3	what's that called,
sd	B.76 utt4	it's, correspondence school,
sd	B.76 utt5	they do it at home.
b	A.77 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.79 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.79 utt2	yeah.
sv	B.80 utt1	That's interesting.
qy	B.82 utt1	Do you have to have any special training?
sd	A.83 utt2	it depends on the state you live actually.
sd	A.83 utt3	Some laws absolutely prohibit it.
sd	A.83 utt4	Some states, say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that.
sd	A.83 utt5	Our state doesn't yet, say that
sd	A.83 utt6	and I'm not a certified teacher.
sd	A.83 utt7	I went to college,
sd	A.83 utt8	you know, but my kids are only elementary levels right now
bf	B.84 utt1	So they haven't been to public schools at all.
no	A.85 utt1	One of them was for a couple of years
sd	A.85 utt2	and so, you know, my oldest, he was,
sd	A.85 utt3	and then my youngest two have never been.
