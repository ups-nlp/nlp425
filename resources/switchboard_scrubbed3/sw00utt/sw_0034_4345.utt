sd	B.1 utt1	I, get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED on national public radio.
sd	B.1 utt2	that is one of my big sources for current events information.
sd	B.1 utt3	I really like that coverage.
sd	B.1 utt4	My wife, on the other hand is home most of the day
sd	B.1 utt5	and she watches a lot of the cable news network.
qy	B.1 utt6	h , have you, ever heard of ALL THINGS CONSIDERED?
nn	A.2 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.2 utt2	we don't have the, national public radio in my area.
b	B.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.4 utt1	I can hear it at the college town nearby when I'm in Stillwater, which is about an hour away,
sd	A.4 utt2	but the F M signal doesn't reach this far.
b^r	B.5 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.6 utt1	I'll listen to shortwave quite a bit.
sv	A.6 utt2	It gives you a whole different perspective on the news, when you hear it from, say, a European point of view, or from the country of origin.
b^r	B.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.8 utt2	I agree with you, too, on the cable channel, C N N and HEADLINE NEWS.
sd	A.8 utt3	I'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper which is why I rely on shortwave and then the cable, cable, C N N.
b^r	B.9 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.13 utt1	I'm, interested in the shortwave aspect of it.
qo	B.13 utt2	how do you find that the coverage from other places in the world , compares with the American coverage of,
qo	B.13 utt3	how do you think that, the viewpoints differ?
sv	A.14 utt1	I think a lot of it is just, the fact that in the U S you're so far removed, in a lot of cases from, say, conflicts
sv	A.14 utt2	or it's not happening in your backyard
b	B.15 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.16 utt1	so it's more of a, it's not as personal, the news isn't as personal in what we receive domestically than what's on shortwave.
sv	A.16 utt2	B B C is, oh, I don't know the right word, is, is almost,
sv	A.16 utt3	they almost take all emotions out of it when they report it
b^r	B.17 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.18 utt3	they seem to give more of just the facts than opinions.
qy	B.19 utt1	Do you think, then, that, the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts?
na	A.20 utt1	very much so,
na^r	A.20 utt2	very much so,
sv	A.20 utt3	and I think a lot of it is, especially T V news,
sv	A.20 utt4	they don't really have the time and a lot of them don't have the education and the background to, to really decipher the news and to really explain it.
sv	A.22 utt2	I mean, you know, I think it's important to interpret it,
sv	A.22 utt3	but a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to do the interpreting.
b	B.23 utt1	Uh huh.
qr	B.23 utt2	which approach do you find to be, more useful, the interpretive approach or the straight reporting?
sd	A.24 utt1	I like the straight reporting.
sd	A.24 utt2	and then I hope to be able to form my own opinion of it.
sv	A.24 utt3	it's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it
b	B.25 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.26 utt1	I always think it's humorous when the President gives the State of the Union for thirty minutes
sd	A.26 utt2	and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard.
sd	A.28 utt1	And a lot of time I don't hear exactly what they write into it.
b	B.29 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.30 utt1	So overall, I think I would rather hear just straight reporting.
sv	B.31 utt1	One of the things that I found interesting last year during the Gulf conflict was a sentiment against, Peter Arnett, who had stayed in Iraq and was presenting, some of the things that were available.
sd	B.31 utt2	there was, a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory,
sd	B.31 utt3	and while he was being severely, censored and could not make any judgment call on this, it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda,
sd	B.31 utt4	but people were really down on him for reporting the fact that, you know, this isn't a baby milk factory,
qh	B.31 utt5	how could he say it was,
sv	B.31 utt6	I think that, that to me showed that the Americans were really getting used to having not just the facts, but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them.
aa	A.34 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.34 utt2	I think people have that opinion.
sv	A.34 utt3	they want to sit down in front of the TV or read a magazine or U S A TODAY and read in four paragraphs, and find out every ,
