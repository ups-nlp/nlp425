fp	B.1 utt1	Hi.
b	A.2 utt1	Okay.
sv	A.2 utt2	So, with the issue of trial by jury, I actually found the whole question about whether you need a unan , a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting.
aa	B.3 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.3 utt2	actually, I agree that that's an interesting thing.
qy^g	B.3 utt3	I believe for civil suits it's not unanimous, right,
qy^d	B.3 utt4	but for criminal suits it's unanimous by federal law?
no	A.4 utt1	I don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because I thought there were cases I don't know if it's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors, but where it was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve.
aa	B.5 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.5 utt2	I actually thought I'd read that, too
sd	B.5 utt3	and that's why I phrased it that way.
b	A.6 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.7 utt1	I wonder,
sv	B.7 utt2	yeah, the difference could be that for, if there is such a thing, state felonies versus federal felonies that things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote,
sv	B.7 utt3	and things that are under state jurisdiction, even criminal don't require,
h	B.7 utt4	but I don't know what the laws,
qy	B.7 utt5	do you think that that's an unreasonable, requirement that they be unanimous?
^h	A.8 utt1	Well, I'd be curious as to what the, requirement for an acquittal is.
sv	A.8 utt2	And I don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if, you know, six or seven voted not guilty, then instead of it being a hung jury, that was an acquittal.
sd	A.8 utt3	But I don't know whether you need a unanimous, vote of not guilty to acquit.
b	B.9 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.9 utt2	that would be an interesting change.
sv	B.9 utt3	It was also allow the, idea that if you had one person who was, very disagreeable that, I mean, it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because, the, the principle is that the fact that it's unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt, criterion that it, increases the likelihood of getting the proper judgment.
sv	B.9 utt4	So, I think, if anything, it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision.
aa	A.10 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.10 utt2	I'd agree with that.
sd	A.10 utt3	But I've never had the opportunity to serve on a jury, although I've been out here and registered for, I guess, about five years.
b	B.11 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.11 utt2	actually I thought that that would be very interesting thing to do.
sd	B.13 utt2	I would like to do that.
sd	B.13 utt3	I've been out here twenty some years
sd	B.13 utt4	and I've been called, three different times,
sd	B.13 utt5	but I've never actually even made it into the jury box. because there have always been a number of people
b	A.14 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.15 utt2	and I've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions.
aa	B.15 utt4	yeah,
sv	B.15 utt5	I also think that would be really good.
sd	A.16 utt1	Well, the people I know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that, you know, after initially finding out where people stand, that the whole deliberation usually results, if there is you know, something like a nine, three or more severe and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they're right
b	B.17 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.18 utt1	and in fact, I'm not sure that that's any more, liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than anything else.
sv	B.19 utt1	Well, the one thing that I know does seem to happen from people I've talked to on this, is that in the situation you just said where it's nine to three, or some such number, that there's starts being a lot of peer pressure going on
b	A.20 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.21 utt2	and that, peer pressure,
sv	B.21 utt3	and in some cases if it's a long trial, the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time, that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons.
b	A.22 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.22 utt2	I'd read one book, I think it was calls TRIAL BY JURY of all things, that, went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases, and in many cases looking at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right, went back to the jurors, based on the deliberations.
b	B.25 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.26 utt2	Some of them did say that, you know, when they were the only one left opposing the verdict, you know, everyone was getting on them so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict.
b	B.27 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.27 utt2	I understand.
sv	B.27 utt3	you would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude, to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response.
sd	B.27 utt4	I think of the movie, TWELVE ANGRY MEN.
b	A.28 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	B.29 utt1	You ever seen that movie?
ny	A.30 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.30 utt2	once.
b	B.31 utt1	, yeah,
sd	B.31 utt2	it's, it's exactly that situation where,
sd	B.31 utt3	it's Henry Fonda
sd	B.31 utt4	and it's eleven to one
sd	B.31 utt5	and he's the one,
sd	B.31 utt6	I believe he was opposed to the conviction
sd	B.31 utt7	and he held on
