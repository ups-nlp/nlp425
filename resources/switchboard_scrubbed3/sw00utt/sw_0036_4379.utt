qw	A.3 utt1	So, what is your, family,
qo	A.3 utt2	what do you usually do as far as budgeting?
sd	B.4 utt1	We have a very detailed budget. Because my husband is a finance major.
b	A.5 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.6 utt1	And you know, we have money that we take out each month you know, for food and for gas and things like that.
sd	B.6 utt2	And then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for Christmas and for, other things.
b^r	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.8 utt1	Then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year
sd	B.8 utt2	and we budget them into what we call our needs and wants list.
b^r	A.9 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.10 utt1	And so, the things like a vacation.
sd	B.10 utt2	We have a vacation fund.
sd	B.10 utt3	We have a fund for the things we need. And then for the things that we want.
b^r	A.11 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.12 utt1	and we're continually putting into those, you know, each month how much we're going to need
sd	B.12 utt2	and then we know the month that we're going to have enough to get that particular item.
b^r	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.14 utt1	So we very rarely buy anything on credit.
sd	B.14 utt2	Everything we buy is paid for.
b	A.15 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.15 utt2	My husband is a finance major also .
sv	A.17 utt1	And, we kind of have the same plan.
sd	A.17 utt2	we have one credit card
sd	A.17 utt3	and every month we put, you know, the same amount in for retirement.
sd	A.17 utt4	and we're, our, our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby.
sd	A.17 utt5	So we're, budgeting, each month, an allowance for his education starting now.
b	B.20 utt1	Right.
b^r	B.22 utt1	Right.
sd	A.23 utt1	So that's in our budget every month now.
sd	A.23 utt2	That's the newest addition.
sd	A.23 utt3	But we too do the same thing as far as,
sd	A.23 utt4	we have a set amount
sd	A.23 utt5	we take, one big vacation a year and then maybe, you know, three small vacations.
sd	A.23 utt6	So you know, an, exact amount that we spend on that each year.
b	B.26 utt1	Right.
sd	B.28 utt1	we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money. instead of just writing checks for things.
b	A.29 utt1	Uh huh.
b^r	A.31 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.32 utt1	If we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here.
b	A.33 utt1	I see.
sd	B.34 utt1	And we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays, that we want to put in for, the vacation. That we put in for Christmas.
qy	A.35 utt1	Like you have a separate account for that then?
h	B.36 utt1	Well, a lot of that, I don't know how safe it is.
sd	B.36 utt2	I guess, we keep it all in a safe here at the house.
b	A.37 utt1	I see.
b	A.37 utt2	Uh huh.
sd	B.38 utt1	And so it's actually pulled out.
sd	B.38 utt2	Then we keep our
b	A.39 utt1	I see.
sd	B.40 utt1	we have a savings account for the kids' education.
sd	B.40 utt2	That money goes into there.
b	A.41 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.42 utt2	we have three children.
sd	B.42 utt3	So they each have their own account.
b	A.43 utt1	I see.
sd	B.44 utt1	That money is put into each month.
b	A.45 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.45 utt2	Does your husband deal in, stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff?
qy	A.45 utt3	does he invest in that and for long term?
no	B.46 utt1	He does somewhat.
ny	B.48 utt1	Yeah.
sd^e	B.48 utt2	He does somewhat.
b	A.49 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.50 utt1	we have an investment plan.
h	B.50 utt3	I guess he does.
b	A.51 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.52 utt1	But, we have really found,
sd	B.52 utt2	this is the first year we've done it this way.
sd	B.52 utt3	And we are really saving a lot of money.
b	A.53 utt1	Really.
bf	A.53 utt2	Because you've, you've sat down with a piece of paper and said well let's see what are we going to,
qw	A.53 utt3	so what goes into that particular thing?
bf	A.55 utt1	It's vacations, Christmas.
sd	B.56 utt1	Christmas, birthdays, car maintenance, dental, medical,
sd	B.56 utt2	we just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much we used on dental
b	A.57 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.58 utt2	and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance doesn't cover rather than wondering where it's going to come from,
b	A.59 utt1	Right.
sd	B.60 utt2	we have it, you know.
b	A.61 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.62 utt1	And when we see something on sale, instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we've got enough and getting it, and then when something comes up, you know, kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill. Everything's taken care of.
b^r	A.63 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.64 utt2	And we're finding that we even have more money than we thought.
bh	A.65 utt1	Really.
ny	B.66 utt1	Yeah .
qw	A.67 utt1	Well, you know, what do you do as far as,
sv	A.67 utt2	I take it,

na	B.68 utt1	I do.
ny	B.68 utt2	Uh huh.
sd	B.68 utt3	All the money.
b	A.69 utt1	Uh huh.
br	A.69 utt2	And what's that?
sd	B.70 utt1	All the money is turned over to me.
b	A.71 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.71 utt2	Do you have a set amount that you spend each month
qo	A.71 utt3	or or how do you work that?
ny	B.72 utt1	Yes.
sd^e	B.74 utt1	I have a set amount.
sv	B.74 utt2	It's very generous
sd	B.74 utt3	and I usually have extra.
b	A.75 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.76 utt1	And so then that can go, you know, either back into our checking account
sd	B.76 utt2	or I can just carry it over.
b^r	A.77 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.78 utt1	you know, there are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months. And certain times when that will be left over.
b^r	A.79 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.80 utt2	But that's completely up to me how I do that.
sd	B.80 utt3	And then, } because I don't work. I stay home.
b	A.81 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.83 utt1	I do too.
sd	A.83 utt2	I stay home also.
sd	B.84 utt1	And so it's kind of my money
sd	B.84 utt2	and I also get my own money to do what I want to. Go to lunches, you know, and do that kind of thing.
b	A.85 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.86 utt1	We have a clothing, envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing.
b^r	A.87 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.88 utt1	It really works out great.
sd	B.88 utt2	We're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that.
b	A.89 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.89 utt3	as far as like big things like something comes up and you have to buy a T V or a big item, like for the house.
qy	A.89 utt5	do you have like a household?
ny	B.90 utt1	Yes.
sd^e	B.90 utt2	We have a household budget.
sd	B.90 utt3	Like we're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that's coming out of her crib this year.
b	A.91 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.92 utt1	And also, we need a new bed.
sd	B.92 utt2	And so we've got both of those budgeted
sd	B.92 utt3	and we put a certain amount in each month
sd	B.92 utt4	and we know which month we'll enough saved to go buy those.
b^r	A.93 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.94 utt1	And if we find one on sale before then, then we can just take that and put it towards ,
