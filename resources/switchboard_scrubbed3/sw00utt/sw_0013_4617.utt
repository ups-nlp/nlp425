o	A.1 utt1	Okay.
sd	B.2 utt1	I say they,
sv	B.2 utt2	probably the best things to do is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water
sv	B.2 utt3	if they sink they're innocent right.
b	A.3 utt1	I see.
bf	A.3 utt2	A a good, a good southern solution.
aa	B.6 utt1	Yeah.
qo	B.6 utt2	so, how do you feel?
sd	B.6 utt3	that's, of course, being facetious
b	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.7 utt2	You'd have to say that.
h	A.9 utt1	I don't know.
sd	A.9 utt2	the things they asked to talk about were whether the judge should be the one that does the, sentencing.
b	B.10 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.11 utt1	And seems to me that I think that's the way it's done now.
h	A.11 utt2	at least, my understanding of the law which isn't very good.
b	B.14 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.15 utt1	it seems to me that the judge does it
sv	A.15 utt2	and I think that's probably all right in that they, you know, maybe know what the norm is for a particular thing.
b	B.16 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.18 utt1	And, I guess, also what the system will absorb .
b	A.19 utt1	Right.
sv	B.20 utt1	Probably more tuned in to that.
sv	B.20 utt2	Possibly though on, capital cases like maybe the death penalty
b	A.21 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.22 utt1	I'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole,
sv	B.22 utt2	I mean he could have like a personal prejudice.
sd	B.22 utt3	You know, judges are people like everybody else even though they're supposed to be impartial
aa	A.23 utt1	That's right.
sv	A.25 utt1	And I think I, that may be an exception as well.
qy	A.25 utt3	doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than the judge?
na	B.26 utt1	I think that's, I think that's the way it is.
b	A.27 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.28 utt1	they, they decide whether or not the accused or whatever would get the death penalty.
qy	B.28 utt2	Do they have a death penalty in California? .
ny	A.29 utt1	Yes.
sd^e	A.29 utt2	In fact, they're going to execute somebody at the end of this month.
b	B.30 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.32 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.33 utt1	And, there's a big uproar going on right now.
b	B.34 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.35 utt1	the, Governor, you know, has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not.
b	B.36 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.37 utt1	You know, it's someone who had, killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact.
b	B.40 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.40 utt3	something like that, I've got no problem with it.
b	A.41 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.42 utt1	I guess the way I think about it it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge.
sv	B.42 utt2	It's just like if you've got like a dog that's running wild and biting people
b	A.43 utt1	Uh huh.
ad	B.44 utt1	put it to sleep, you know.
ad	B.44 utt2	Just get it out, you know,
sd	B.44 utt3	it's not able to fit in, you know .
bf	A.45 utt1	Something inexpensive.
aa	B.46 utt1	Yeah.
aa^r	B.46 utt2	Yeah,
aa	B.46 utt3	exactly .
sv	B.46 utt4	I guess, kind of the way I think about it also, is they just,
sd	B.48 utt2	if somebody gets the death penalty, they're judged guilty,
sd	B.48 utt3	they got the death penalty,
sv	B.48 utt4	they should have one year and one appeal. Cover all their bases with one appeal
sv	B.48 utt5	and if not, you know, don't let them sit up there on death row for, you know, fifteen years.
b	A.49 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.49 utt2	I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years.
b	B.50 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.50 utt2	Yeah,
sd	A.51 utt1	But I guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake
sv	A.51 utt2	and you'd hate to be one of those.
aa	B.52 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.52 utt2	I'm sure .
b	B.54 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.55 utt1	The other thing they asked about was whether the verdict should be required to be unanimous. Which, again, I think is the way it is now. That all verdicts,
b	B.56 utt1	Uh huh.
ar	A.57 utt2	well maybe not.
sd	A.57 utt3	I don't know.
sv	A.57 utt4	At least in capital cases I'd think they'd have to be unanimous.
sd	B.58 utt1	I believe it is in capital.
sd	B.60 utt2	I think in like, lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve or five out of six, whatever . How ever many is sitting on a jury.
b	A.61 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.62 utt2	I believe that's the way it is.
sv	B.62 utt3	But I'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases. ,
b	A.63 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.63 utt2	The paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial. And that there's one juror that is, different than the other eleven.
b	B.64 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.66 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.67 utt1	And, they've only deliberated four hours or, something
sd	A.69 utt2	and they say they're hopelessly deadlocked.
ba	B.70 utt1	no .
sd	A.71 utt1	And the judge told them , they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet .
ad	B.74 utt1	I'm telling you, go one way or the other.
sv	B.74 utt2	that's probably an expensive trial.
aa	A.75 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.75 utt2	Six months so far they said.
b	B.76 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.76 utt2	Probably.
b	B.78 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.78 utt2	Probably.
sv	B.78 utt3	You know, I'm not sure there's a number.
sv	B.78 utt4	It's probably like thirty, forty thousand dollars a day you know, worth of all the free for all.
sd	A.79 utt1	Maybe they could go with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their, vote.
b	B.80 utt1	Yeah .
b^r	B.80 utt2	Yeah,
sd	B.80 utt3	that's been so long I've practically forgot who Noriega was, you know.
b	A.81 utt1	Right.
sd	B.82 utt1	That has been going on .
sd	B.82 utt2	My, cousin is a F B I agent down in Miami.
bh	A.83 utt1	really?
ny	B.84 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.84 utt2	So she follows that stuff pretty closely.
sv	A.85 utt1	That's interesting.
b	B.86 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.86 utt2	she's not involved in that case.
qy	A.87 utt1	Well have you ever served on a jury?
nn	B.88 utt1	No
sd^e	B.88 utt2	I haven't.
sd	B.88 utt3	I never have.
sd	B.88 utt4	My wife has
sd	B.88 utt5	but I haven't.
b	A.89 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.89 utt2	I got called
sd	A.89 utt3	but I, never, got selected for a jury ,
b	B.90 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.91 utt1	I sat for ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process,
b	B.92 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.95 utt1	and they had some guy that was, defending himself.
b	B.96 utt1	Uh huh.
