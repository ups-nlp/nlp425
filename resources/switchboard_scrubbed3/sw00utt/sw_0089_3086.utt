qy	A.1 utt1	So do you have P C s?
sd	B.2 utt1	I have a personal computer at home.
sd	B.2 utt2	It's an A T compatible.
sd	B.2 utt3	I don't use it very much any more.
sd	B.2 utt4	I used to use it quite a bit.
b	A.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.4 utt1	I also have a P C at work that I use as a terminal.
sd	B.4 utt2	I do some P C stand alone work on it,
sd	B.4 utt3	and I can transfer data back and forth between the P C and the main frame.
b^r	A.5 utt1	Uh huh.
qo	B.6 utt1	What about you?
qy	B.6 utt2	Do you own a computer?
no	A.7 utt1	well I sort of own a computer.
sd	A.7 utt2	We have two P C s at home,
sd	A.7 utt3	but neither one do we really own.
qy	B.8 utt1	Are you leasing them?
nn	A.9 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.9 utt2	both of them are sort of work related,
qy^d	B.10 utt1	Loaners from work?
ny	A.11 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.11 utt2	that's the nicer way, right.
qy	B.12 utt1	Do you work for T I?
nn	A.13 utt1	No,
nn^r	A.13 utt2	no.
sd	A.13 utt3	actually I'm doing consulting right now because I just had a baby,
sd	A.13 utt4	and my husband's working at Bell Labs,
sd	A.13 utt5	but he's really from France,
sd	A.13 utt6	and these computers actually are from France.
qw	B.14 utt1	What brand are they?
sd	A.15 utt1	One of them's a Compaq
bk	B.16 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.17 utt1	it's a three eighty six
ba	B.18 utt1	I'm jealous.
sd	A.19 utt1	and the other is actually a I B M P C compatible,
sd	A.19 utt2	it's a three eighty six,
sv	A.19 utt3	I guess it's twenty five,
aa	A.19 utt4	yeah,
sd	A.19 utt5	three eight six twenty five C maybe
h	A.19 utt6	I don't know,
sd	A.19 utt7	no we don't have the ,
sd	A.19 utt8	we decided not to get the which is actually another loaner one too that we picked up for a consulting job that my husband was doing ,
qw	B.20 utt1	What kind of consulting do you do?
sd	A.21 utt1	well, I actually do some work, working at M I T and at NIST, National Institute of Standards and Technology in Washington,
b	B.22 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.23 utt2	and then I worked for Dragon Systems for a while.
qw	B.24 utt1	What kind of work do you do when you're consulting?
^h	A.25 utt1	well, it depends,
sd	A.25 utt2	it's very different in the different places,
qy	B.26 utt1	Is it programming related?
ny	A.27 utt1	Yeah,
ny^r	A.27 utt2	yeah.
sd^e	A.27 utt3	Program related, research related,
sd	A.27 utt4	and I work in the speech field,
sd	A.27 utt5	and I do a lot metacoustic phonetics and looking at the acoustic characteristics of speech,
b	B.28 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.29 utt2	and I do that type of stuff typically for other people,
sd	A.29 utt3	and like here we use the P C s to do that.
sd	A.29 utt4	Mostly I use it for writing papers and things like that.
bf	B.30 utt1	Word processing.
ar	A.31 utt1	Well, more,
qy	A.31 utt2	do you know Latek? Wo , Word text processing,
nn^e	B.32 utt1	No I'm not familiar with that.
sd	A.35 utt2	so I don't use, I mean,
sd	A.35 utt3	you can call it word processing,
sd	A.35 utt4	but I don't usually use a word processor to do it
b	B.36 utt1	Uh huh
sd	A.37 utt1	and we don't have too much standard software.
sd	A.37 utt2	Like we haven't really bought any commercially available software at all.
sd	A.37 utt3	So we don't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that.
sd	A.37 utt4	We use it more for just writing programs when we need to or, doing research, looking at the speech signal and then doing writing, and also just as a terminal,
sd	A.37 utt5	and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that.
bf	B.38 utt1	So, you've got a modem in it then.
ng	A.39 utt1	neither one has a modem,
sd	A.39 utt2	but we have a modem.
qy^d	B.40 utt1	At home you have a modem that you can connect to each of them?
sd	A.41 utt1	Neither one,
na	A.43 utt1	Right.
qy^d	B.44 utt1	and so it's an external modem.
ny	A.45 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.45 utt2	we have .
sd	B.46 utt1	when I got mine I had an internal modem in it
b	A.47 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.48 utt1	I used it, quite a bit when I was, looking at, information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a newspaper in Fort Worth
b^r	A.49 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.50 utt1	but, went out of town for a while,
sd	B.50 utt2	and sort of got off the, bulletin board and off of my micro completely
b^r	A.51 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.52 utt1	and after a while the modem started making noises on its own even without using it on the computer,
sd	B.52 utt2	I could turn a computer on,
sd	B.52 utt3	it'd start squawking.
sd	B.52 utt4	So I finally opened up the box and took it out.
bf	A.53 utt1	So that was it.
sv	B.54 utt1	I think that's the thirty second warning.
sd	A.55 utt1	I didn't hear it.
qy	A.55 utt2	Do you hear, the beep in the background.
ny	B.56 utt1	Yes.
sv	A.57 utt1	that's an ambulance or something going on here, I think.
aa	B.58 utt1	Okay.
qw	B.58 utt2	Where, Where are you,
sd	A.59 utt1	I haven't ever noticed the thirty second warning actually.
sd	A.61 utt1	In Manhattan.
qy	B.62 utt1	Are you at home now?
ny	A.63 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.63 utt2	I'm at home.
qy^d	B.64 utt1	So you've got a lot of traffic noise real close.
ny	A.65 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.65 utt2	So it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal I mean, because there's a lot of background noise that, you know, people can hear.
sv	A.65 utt3	So it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up.
sd	A.65 utt6	I can't do this much later than now, between sort of like six, five thirty and six thirty or something like that, because the traffic outside, they honk the horn so loud I can't even hear the phone call.
qw	B.66 utt1	What time is it now where you are?
sd	A.67 utt1	about twenty after four.
sd	B.68 utt1	So you're an hour ahead of where I am.
sd	B.68 utt2	I'm in Central Central time zone.
b	A.69 utt1	Okay,
sd	A.71 utt1	we're Eastern.
qy	A.71 utt2	And, did you ever try using like Prodigy or any of those systems?
nn	B.72 utt1	No,
sd^e	B.72 utt2	I haven't done that.
sd	B.72 utt3	I know someone who has,
sd	B.72 utt4	and she's, very, pleased with it.
sd	B.72 utt5	She told me some of the things you can do,
sd	B.72 utt6	and it's just a very handy tool to have.
b	A.73 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.74 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.74 utt2	and you can do a l ,
sv	B.74 utt3	it makes things very convenient.
sv	B.74 utt4	You can save a lot of money, too. Certainly cut down on long distance charges if that's what you have in mind.
b	A.75 utt1	Uh huh,
b	A.75 utt2	yeah,
sd	A.75 utt3	I've never tried using that,
sd	A.75 utt4	I don't know too much about it.
qw	A.75 utt5	What about,
qy	A.75 utt6	did you use commercially available software
sd	B.76 utt1	I have used Lotus.
sd	B.76 utt2	I have used, Word Perfect
b	A.77 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.78 utt2	not heavy use.
sd	B.78 utt3	I've used, D Base
sd	B.78 utt4	and, I've used a substantial amount of shareware.
sd	B.78 utt5	I haven't done much Lotus work connected with my job.
sd	B.78 utt6	I've been through three classes
b^r	A.79 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.80 utt1	and I have a great deal of respect for it.
b^r	A.81 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.82 utt1	I haven't done much word processing work with my job.
sd	B.82 utt2	I do some
b^r	A.83 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.84 utt2	and the D Base work I've done was strictly class related.
sd	A.85 utt1	I've never used D Base,
sd	A.85 utt2	but I've heard both good things and bad things about it.
sd	B.86 utt1	Well, it's probably the granddaddy of most, data base management systems.
b	A.87 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.88 utt1	It's got some pretty strong competitors.
sd	B.88 utt2	Some of them have reviews that are better than D Base,
sv	B.88 utt3	so, I think by now, it's a matter of, personal taste.
b	A.89 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.89 utt2	people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use.
sd	B.90 utt1	I can understand that very easily.
sd	B.90 utt2	I've had a class on, R Base and also in Paradox
b	A.91 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.92 utt1	and both of those seem very easy to use compared to D Base.
b^r	A.93 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.93 utt2	Do you think D Base is more flexible or allows you to do more.
qrr	A.93 utt3	Or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days?
sv	B.94 utt1	I wouldn't say compatible, but certainly comparable.
b	A.97 utt1	yeah,
sd	A.97 utt2	I didn't mean compatible,
sd	A.97 utt3	I meant comparable.
sd	A.97 utt4	My brain is going to mush.
b	B.98 utt1	Uh huh.
qw	A.99 utt1	And what do you work on at T I?
sd	B.100 utt1	I'm a computer programmer on the I B M main frames.
b	A.101 utt1	Uh huh.
b^r	A.103 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.104 utt1	I do, mainly business data processing.
b^r	A.105 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.106 utt1	I also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility.
b^r	A.107 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.108 utt1	sometimes I get called late at night at home because there's a production problem,
sd	B.108 utt2	and that gives me the opportunity to, come in to work and fix it, if I can't think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we're on the phone.
b	A.111 utt1	Right.
sd	B.112 utt1	I also, handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who need to find out something connected,
