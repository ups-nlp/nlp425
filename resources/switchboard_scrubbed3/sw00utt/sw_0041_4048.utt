o	B.1 utt1	pretty good,
o^r	B.1 utt2	pretty good.
qy^g*	B.1 utt3	So we're talking about drug testing in the work place, / * listen
b^m	A.2 utt1	Drug testing in the work place.
sd	A.2 utt2	I've been tested a few times, just before employment.
sd	A.2 utt3	But that's about it.
sd	A.2 utt4	I've never had random drug testing.
b	B.3 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.3 utt2	we have random drug testing in my business,
sd	B.3 utt3	but I've never had to do it.
bh	A.4 utt1	really?
ny	B.5 utt1	Yeah,
ny^r	B.5 utt2	yeah,
sd^e	B.5 utt3	they started that about a year ago,
sv	B.5 utt4	and I think it's mostly for the field people that, you know, drive trucks and heavy machinery, that kind of stuff.
b	A.6 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.7 utt1	But, they have done some testing around our office, mostly after lunch, looking for people drinking beer and stuff at lunch time,
qy^d	A.8 utt1	they do with alcohol.
br	B.9 utt1	Pardon?
qy^r	A.10 utt1	They do it with alcohol?
ny	B.11 utt1	Yeah,
ny^r	B.11 utt2	yeah,
sd^e	B.11 utt3	they, they'll check for alcohol.
sv	A.12 utt1	I thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine.
ar	B.13 utt1	No,
sd	B.13 utt2	once you start doing that stuff, you're sort of stuck into, checking for the whole thing.
ba	A.14 utt1	That's interesting.
b	B.15 utt1	Yeah,
qw	A.16 utt1	What type of field of work are you in?
sd	B.17 utt1	I'm in the oil business.
b^m	A.18 utt1	in the oil business.
aa	B.19 utt1	Yeah.
bk	A.20 utt1	Okay,
qy^d	A.20 utt2	and you work in the office around.
ny	B.21 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.21 utt2	I work in the office,
sv	B.21 utt3	so, it's pretty safe environment.
b	A.22 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.24 utt1	Yeah
sd	A.24 utt2	see, I work in the automotive air bag industry, where we make the safety bags for the cars,
b	B.25 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	B.25 utt2	uh huh.
sd	A.26 utt2	and we work around a lot of explosives.
sv	B.27 utt1	Well, that sounds like kind of an important job to be, straight on.
b	A.28 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.28 utt3	I'm all for it, because well, the type of environment I work in, you know, they're working with explosives,
sv	A.28 utt4	and so they could blow up the whole,
sd	A.28 utt5	well, they have safety features with each of the explosives they use,
sv	A.28 utt6	but still, it can be dangerous.
aa	B.29 utt1	Yeah,
aa^r	B.29 utt2	yeah,
aa	B.29 utt3	well, I, I agree.
sv	B.29 utt4	I think that, you know, under certain circumstances, especially when you're working in high risk, industries, where you can really hurt other people, that you need to have that kind of stuff.
b	A.30 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.31 utt3	as long as it's not abused, you know, random, you know,
sd	B.31 utt4	as long as it's random, and the individual's rights are protected, I don't have that big a problem with it.
qr	A.32 utt1	Now do they fire them, or do they?
^h	B.33 utt1	Well, see, this is it,
sd	B.33 utt2	this is where I start having my problems with my company.
sd	B.33 utt3	I work for a private company,
sd	B.33 utt4	and and the policy is something like, see if I can state this correctly now. If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem, then you're eligible for company counseling.
b	A.34 utt1	Uh huh.
b^r	A.36 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.37 utt1	But if they catch you, if you test positive for a controlled substance, then you get fired.
ba	A.38 utt1	wow.
sv	B.39 utt1	So, you know, it's sort of one of these little catch twenty twos.
sv	A.40 utt2	I think our policy is that,
sv	A.40 utt3	all right, it's probably the same thing.
h	A.40 utt4	I'm not really sure what the ,
b	B.41 utt1	Yeah,
b	B.41 utt2	really,
sv	B.41 utt3	it's one of those things that you read once,
sv	B.41 utt4	and then, if you're not worried about it, you just forget about it .
aa	A.42 utt1	That's right.
sd	A.42 utt2	But I know, they do have counseling, and that they do give you a second chance,
sd	A.42 utt3	but I'm not sure if if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in.
b	B.43 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.45 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.45 utt2	yeah,
sd	B.45 utt3	our company's a little tougher on the second chance.
sv	B.45 utt4	I mean, if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in, then they ought to, you know, go out of the way, I think, a little bit more to help get you rehabilitated you know, to get back at your job.
b	A.46 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.47 utt1	But, when you're a private company, the rules don't always apply.
qy	A.48 utt1	do you think it limits,
no	B.49 utt1	Well, it's hard for me to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment
sd	B.49 utt3	I guess I haven't run into anybody that's had a problem that's been a problem.
b	A.50 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.51 utt1	so you know, I guess it works, much well, shoot, like any lottery,
sd	B.51 utt2	I mean, everybody's got an equal chance to get picked.
b^r	A.52 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.53 utt1	So, I'd rather have that than, you know, say well, this week the A s and B s are going to be in
sd	B.53 utt2	and next week, C s and D s are going to come in .
sv	A.56 utt1	You could time it just right.
aa	B.57 utt1	Yeah,
aa	B.57 utt2	right,
aa^r	B.57 utt3	right.
sd	A.58 utt1	I know one employee,
sd	A.58 utt2	I know, when I was working with, he had alcohol on his breath,
sd	A.58 utt3	and I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not.
sv	A.58 utt4	That'd be just as dangerous.
aa	B.59 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.59 utt2	Well, especially around, you know, equipment, machinery and stuff.
aa	A.60 utt1	That's true.
sd	B.61 utt1	You know, I've gone out and had a beer at lunch time, but not to excess in any case .
b	A.62 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.62 utt2	Do they give any limits on alcohol,
qrr	A.62 utt3	or is it?
no	B.63 utt1	I don't remember, to tell you the truth.
sv	B.63 utt2	I don't think they do.
sv	B.63 utt3	well, they must,
fe	B.63 utt4	I mean, gee whiz.
sd	B.63 utt5	That just shows you how much I've been paying attention,
sd	B.63 utt6	because I really don't know.
sd	B.65 utt1	I'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask .
b	A.66 utt1	Oh.
sv	B.67 utt1	Well, you know, you can take some of that testing a little bit too far.
sd	B.67 utt2	there was a company in Houston
sd	B.67 utt3	they did, an unannounced drug sweep of their company
b	A.68 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.69 utt1	it was, it was an unannounced sweep of,
sd	B.69 utt2	it was not only drugs,
