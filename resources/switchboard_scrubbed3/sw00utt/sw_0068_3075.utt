qy	B.1 utt1	Lynn, do you want to start?
na	A.2 utt1	Certainly.
bk	B.3 utt1	Okay.
qy	B.5 utt1	Do you want to tell me about summer vacations you've taken
sd	A.6 utt1	Well, I tend to, take two kinds of vacations, the vacations to visit family and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sight seeing and things like that.
b	B.7 utt1	Uh huh.
qw	B.9 utt1	Which is your favorite?
sd	A.10 utt1	well, I couldn't live without the family vacations,
sd	A.10 utt2	but, my favorite is the indulgent ones, where we go off and, see places that have interested me since I was a kid, for the most part.
b	B.11 utt1	Uh huh.
qy^d	B.13 utt1	Your family doesn't live close, then?
ng	A.14 utt1	not anymore.
sd	A.14 utt2	they've been in San Diego for the last few years,
sd	A.14 utt3	and they're moving to Florida.
bk	B.15 utt1	Okay.
sd	A.16 utt1	And that's one of those things,
sv	A.16 utt2	you just have to go once a year.
b	B.17 utt1	Yep,
sd	B.17 utt2	I understand.
sd	A.18 utt1	So, basically it sorts out into that,
sd	A.18 utt2	and then about once every three or four years I try to get over to England, because I lived there for a while, some years back.
ba	B.19 utt1	Wow.
sd	B.21 utt1	I've only been there once.
b	A.22 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.23 utt1	and I'd love to go back.
sv	A.24 utt1	Beautiful country.
sv^r	A.24 utt2	Beautiful country,
sv	A.26 utt1	beautiful people.
b	B.27 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.28 utt2	and I'd real, really like to go because, I'm fairly recently married
sd	B.29 utt1	we had a great time.
sd	A.30 utt2	and my husband has been hearing about these people for years
sd	A.30 utt3	but he's never met them,
sd	A.30 utt4	so, I'd like to do that.
sd	A.30 utt5	But anyway, that's our typical vacation,
sd	A.30 utt6	and, we enjoy the family vacations,
sd	A.30 utt7	but the other ones are very special getaways,
sd	A.30 utt8	and we probably take one of each every year.
qo	A.30 utt9	How about yourself?
sd	B.31 utt1	Well, we, as you do, take family vacations, sometimes one a year,
sd	B.31 utt2	but this year we're not going to be taking one for several reasons.
sd	B.31 utt3	But vacations we really enjoy,
sd	B.31 utt4	I think we've been on three cruises.
sd	A.32 utt1	I've never, been on a cruise.
sd	B.33 utt1	And we, we really love cruises.
sd	B.35 utt2	We've gone on CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES.
b	A.36 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.37 utt1	And, we've gone fairly inexpensive as most cruises go.
sd	B.37 utt2	we usually book just a month before it's ready to go.
b	A.38 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.39 utt1	And we get upgraded.
sd	B.39 utt2	last two times, in fact, we had an outside room
sv	B.39 utt3	and it was beautiful.
sd	B.41 utt1	And we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around.
qw	A.42 utt1	Well, what do you do on a cruise?
sd	A.42 utt2	I've never been on a cruise.
sd	B.43 utt1	my God, you do everything.
sd	B.45 utt1	I mean, you can be as busy as you want to be, or as laid back as you want to be.
sd	B.45 utt2	You can sit in the sun all day around the pool,
sd	B.45 utt3	or you can take part in the games that they have going on.
sd	B.45 utt4	They always have bingo.
sd	B.45 utt5	They have a casino.
sd	B.45 utt6	they have a massage parlor.
sd	B.45 utt7	They have exercise,
sv	B.45 utt8	I mean, you can do anything.
sd	B.47 utt1	And that's just aboard ship.
sd	B.47 utt2	And then when the ship docks, you get to go sight seeing and shopping.
b	A.48 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.49 utt1	And that's quite fun.
b^r	A.50 utt1	Uh huh.
qw	A.50 utt2	And where have you been on these cruises?
sd	B.51 utt1	Nassau, San Juan, Saint Thomas.
sd	B.51 utt2	We've been there twice.
sd	B.51 utt3	We went two cruises that hit those islands, but with different people.
sd	B.51 utt4	we've gone with friends each time.
b	A.52 utt1	I see.
sd	B.53 utt1	And then we went to, the western Caribbean, which is, Port, Cancun, Cozumel, and Ocho Rios.
bf	A.54 utt1	the Mexican coast.
br	B.55 utt2	Pardon me?
bf	A.56 utt1	That's all Mexico, I think.
aa	B.57 utt1	Yes,
aa	B.57 utt2	uh huh.
sv	B.57 utt3	but it was wonderful.
sd	B.57 utt4	So we really like those.
sd	B.57 utt5	And, I guess we just like to go someplace entirely different.
sd	B.57 utt6	We've been to a few places in this country.
sd	B.57 utt7	We still have a lot to see, though.
qw	A.58 utt1	Where are you from originally?
sd	B.59 utt1	We're from Illinois originally.
bk	A.60 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.61 utt1	And we've been down in Texas eighteen years,
sd	B.61 utt2	and so, like you, we always try to make it, you know, back home to see the relatives.
sd	B.61 utt3	We both still have family there.
b^r	A.62 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.63 utt1	And that's fun.
sd	B.63 utt2	It brings back a lot of memories.
b	A.64 utt1	yes.
sv	B.65 utt1	things are different there, though.
h	B.65 utt3	I don't know.
sv	B.65 utt4	It's just entirely different world than this area.
sd	A.66 utt1	Well, I grew up in Dallas,
sd	A.66 utt2	so I mean, it's not like I'm going home.
bh	B.67 utt1	Did you?
sd	A.68 utt2	My, my parents retired first to San Diego,
b	B.69 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.70 utt2	and they're going now to Florida,
sv	A.70 utt3	and so they're going very nice places,
fe	A.70 utt4	thank God,
b^r	B.71 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.72 utt1	that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know.
sd	A.72 utt2	I really came to love San Diego and feel very, comfortable there.
sd	A.74 utt2	They've been there eight years.
b	B.75 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.76 utt1	And, you know, I just grab the car and drive everywhere.
ba	B.77 utt1	that's great.
sv	A.78 utt1	So it is, it is nice,
sd	A.78 utt2	but it's not home.
sd	A.78 utt3	This is home,
sd	A.78 utt4	and I've never thought about a cruise.
sv	A.78 utt5	It's so funny.
sv	B.79 utt1	they, they really are.
sd	B.79 utt2	yeah, as I said, we've done them three times.
sd	B.79 utt3	We'd be going again this year if circumstances hadn't changed.
sv	B.79 utt4	We, we'd probably go.
b	A.80 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.81 utt2	My husband would, you know,
sd	B.81 utt3	the minute I said the word, he, he's chomping at the bit.
sd	B.83 utt1	He kind of likes the casinos a little bit.
b	A.84 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.85 utt1	But I like all of that.
qw	A.86 utt1	What's the best part, from your point of view?
sd	B.87 utt1	I like seeing other countries and shopping in other places.
b	A.88 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.89 utt1	I like shopping.
sd	B.89 utt2	I can shop anyplace, shop in London and France and wherever.
sd	B.89 utt3	Now, my kids are moving to Toronto,
sd	B.89 utt4	so we're going to be able to go up there.
ba	A.90 utt1	that will be nice.
sd	B.91 utt1	So I'm kind of looking forward to that, except I hate to see them go.
aa	A.92 utt1	sure.
b^r	A.94 utt1	Sure.
ad	A.94 utt2	Well, don't go in the winter.
sd	B.95 utt1	that's what everybody says,
sv	B.95 utt2	and I think it's,
sd	B.95 utt3	I think I'll try to stay away, except my second grandchild will be born in the winter in January.
b	A.96 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.97 utt1	So that will be hard to stay away from.
sd	A.98 utt1	Well, there are exceptions made for special occasions like that.
b	B.99 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.100 utt1	But the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer
aa	B.101 utt1	Isn't that the truth,
aa	B.101 utt2	uh huh.
sv	A.102 utt1	Well, that sounds wonderful.
sv	A.102 utt2	I guess I would contemplate going on a cruise, all circumstances permitting it.
sd	B.103 utt1	Well, there's all age groups too,
sv	B.103 utt2	and that's kind of fun.
sd	B.103 utt3	if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals, you meet different people.
b	A.104 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.105 utt1	You may meet people, you know, thirty years older than you, or younger,
sv	B.105 utt2	and everybody is really interesting,
sv	B.105 utt3	and everybody is there to have a good time
qw	A.106 utt1	How long are the cruises?
sd	B.107 utt1	we've only gone on the seven day cruises.
b	A.108 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.109 utt1	They have shorter ones
sd	B.109 utt2	and then they have ten day ones.
sv	B.109 utt3	But I think seven days is long enough for us.
sd	B.109 utt4	By that time we're ready to get home and get back to our routine.
b	A.110 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.111 utt1	I think most vacations, seven days is enough for us.
sd	B.111 utt3	I think when we went to England and France, we were there ten, twelve days,
sv	B.111 utt4	and that was pushing it a bit.
b	A.112 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.112 utt2	I tend, when I spend enough money to go overseas ,
sd	A.112 utt3	I, go for a long time.
b	B.113 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.115 utt1	Well, that makes sense, it really does.
sd	B.115 utt2	I mean, we went to Panama too.
ba	A.116 utt1	that's interesting.
sd	B.117 utt1	Went to Panama last August.
b	A.118 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.119 utt1	Our son in law is from Panama.
b	A.120 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.121 utt1	And, we went with our daughter and son in law to visit his parents, who live there.
b	A.122 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.123 utt1	And his father is a doctor
sd	B.123 utt2	and his mother is a kindergarten teacher,
sd	B.123 utt3	and they took time off,
sd	B.123 utt4	it was their winter
sd	B.123 utt5	and they were having a little break,
sd	B.123 utt6	so they took some time off that, they could show us around.
sv	B.123 utt7	And it is a beautiful country.
sv	B.125 utt1	It is beautiful.
sd	B.125 utt2	They have mountains.
sd	B.125 utt3	We were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore.
ba	A.126 utt1	That's really nice.
sv	B.127 utt1	And it is gorgeous.
sd	B.127 utt2	They live in a small town called David, which is northern Panama up near Costa Rica.
b	A.128 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.129 utt1	And, it's just, it's just a gorgeous country.
sv	B.129 utt2	Most people don't realize it.
sv	B.129 utt3	I think if they could get tourists coming to their country, they'd improve the economy considerably.
sv	A.130 utt1	Well, maybe now things are calming down again. That will happen.
b	B.131 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.133 utt1	We really hope so.
sv	A.134 utt1	Well, that's really great.
b	B.135 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.136 utt1	I mean, as I said, basically all I've done is go back and forth to parents
ba	B.137 utt1	Well, that's, that's pretty good.
ba^r	B.139 utt1	That's pretty good.
sd	A.140 utt1	and, my husband had a conference in L A,
sd	A.140 utt2	so we spent a week in L A
qy	B.141 utt1	do you like L A?
h	A.142 utt1	I'm, I'm very unusual.
sd	A.142 utt2	I like,
