 sd	A.1 utt1	Well, we're just starting a family through adoption
 sd	A.1 utt2	so I don't really have a lot of, concrete, opinions.
sd	A.1 utt3	Just what I know out of my peer group, has gone through.
sv	A.1 utt4	And none of it has been good .
bh	B.2 utt1	really?
ny	A.3 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.3 utt2	the ones that can afford to have live in nannies, They seem to be having an okay time.
b	B.4 utt1	Huh.
b	B.6 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.7 utt1	but a lot of the other ones that have, are professional,
sv	A.7 utt2	I'd say fifty percent of, you know, my peers in my circle of friends have tried it and then stopped working until they're, you know, going to get their children in kindergarten or first grade.
b	B.8 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.9 utt2	there must be some good service out there if you really look and pay for it.
b	B.10 utt1	Right.
qw	B.12 utt1	what age child are you thinking in terms of?
qy^d	A.13 utt1	In terms of what they're talking about.
nn	B.14 utt1	No.
sd	B.14 utt2	for yourselves .
b	A.15 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.15 utt2	Infant. ...
bk	B.16 utt1	okay.
b^r	A.17 utt1	Infant.
sv	B.18 utt1	So you're starting from the baseline.
aa	A.19 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.19 utt2	After eleven years of marriage. Yeah, we are.
sd	A.19 utt3	actually, it's happening now.
sd	A.19 utt4	So, we're just going through the process.
b	B.20 utt1	I see .
sd	A.21 utt1	So and actually the question is, very appropriate.
sd	A.21 utt2	Cause I'm not sure how strong the maternal instinct is going to be.
sd	A.21 utt3	They tell me it's going to be strong .
qy	A.21 utt4	Do you have children?
b	B.22 utt1	Right.
 sd	B.24 utt1	I have one son.
qy	A.25 utt1	And did you put him in daycare
qrr	A.25 utt2	or is he older now or younger
sd	B.26 utt1	Well, he's now eighteen. And in, you know, has completed a couple of years of university.
b	A.27 utt1	Sure.
sd	A.27 utt2	So he's out of daycare .
b	B.28 utt2	right.
sd	B.28 utt4	but I was working full time, when he was born.
b	A.29 utt1	You,
b	A.29 utt2	uh huh.
sd	B.30 utt2	But I was very lucky because I was a college professor.
b	A.31 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.32 utt1	And so I was able to, you know,
sd	B.32 utt2	and it was walking distance from
b	A.35 utt1	Yeah.
 +	B.36 utt1	my apartment.
sd	B.36 utt2	So I went up there
sd	B.36 utt3	and I sort of left him with a neighbor.
b	A.37 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.38 utt1	And I left him in a carry cot when he was very little .
sd	B.38 utt2	And I said, you know, he doesn't need anything except, you know, look at him if he cries.
sd	B.38 utt3	But, you know, don't pick him up and this sort of stuff.
b	A.39 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.40 utt2	Because I was gone only an hour at a stretch or an hour and a half.
ba	A.41 utt1	that's wonderful.
sd	B.42 utt1	And I was able to, you know, get, his schedule just, cooperated.
b	A.43 utt1	Right.
ba	A.45 utt1	That's wonderful.
b	A.45 utt2	Yeah.
b	B.46 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.47 utt1	and I guess, because of your, profession.
sd	A.47 utt2	I mean, I'm in corporate communications.
sd	A.47 utt3	But I've done free lance writing in the past,
 b	B.48 utt1	Uh huh.
 sd	A.49 utt1	so what we're hoping is that,
sd	A.49 utt2	I mean my husband thinks I can do it.
sd	A.49 utt3	I've just never worked out of a domestic base, you know.
sd	A.49 utt4	I've always been in a corporate, environment.
b	B.50 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.51 utt2	but I'm hoping that possibly I can do something where I can go flextime or part time
sd	A.51 utt3	or if they don't have that,
sd	A.51 utt5	I'm very lucky though, again too, my boss is very akin to family building.
sv	A.51 utt6	So, I think that's th , something that couples need in going into this.
b	B.52 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.54 utt1	Right.
h	A.55 utt1	I don't know.
sd	A.55 utt2	I do think there's good daycare out there.
qw	A.55 utt3	What part of the country are you in?
sd	B.56 utt1	I'm in Maryland.
sd^m	A.57 utt1	You're in Maryland.
sd	B.58 utt1	but I was out of the country when, my son was little.
sv	B.58 utt2	but the thing is, if you have this flextime and that, you might be able to do something similar to what I did. Which is you know, be there short times
b	A.59 utt1	Right.
sd	A.61 utt1	That's what I'm hoping.
sd	B.62 utt2	and then later on when he was, you know
b	A.63 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.64 utt2	we're talking about, I went back to work or taught some classes like a week after he was born.
ba	A.65 utt1	my goodness.
sv	A.65 utt2	You were fortunate.
b	A.67 utt2	Yeah.
b^r	B.68 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.68 utt2	And so that's when I was saying, you know, don't pick him up and stuff.
b	A.69 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.70 utt2	But then later what I did was I brought a woman into the house.
b	A.71 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.71 utt2	Sure.
sd	B.72 utt1	And she was supposed to help me a little bit with cooking and doing the baby's laundry and this sort of stuff.
b	A.73 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.74 utt1	And then, I also came home and sort of was able to see from a distance what she was doing.
b	A.75 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.76 utt1	And, you know, in a sense she carried him around a lot, too much. you know for my taste.
b	A.77 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.79 utt1	Right.
sv(^q)	B.80 utt1	It was constantly, no, I don't want him, to explore anything.
^q	B.82 utt2	he might hurt himself .
qy	A.83 utt1	So I mean, do you think that that was in a way though, good objectivity that, that doesn't really,
sd	A.83 utt2	that's not a correct English
qy^d	A.83 utt3	but , you know in a sense, you see what I'm saying though.
qy^d	A.85 utt2	From a mother's standpoint, I mean in a way, it was quote and unquote good objectivity.
na	B.86 utt1	I think it worked out very, very well.
sd	B.86 utt2	Because what he learned to do by the time he was two or so, he would sit next to the desk where I was grading papers or writing lesson plans.
b	A.87 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.89 utt1	See.
b	A.91 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.92 utt1	And he had asked for a paper and, you know, sort of scribble
sd	B.92 utt2	and then he realized that there were quiet times
b	A.93 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.94 utt2	and there were active times.
b	A.95 utt1	Right.
sd	A.95 utt2	And then he also learned that, there were times that you had to be gone, so you probably minimized,
sd	A.95 utt3	well we're getting ready.
sd	A.95 utt4	I mean, you're far enough away now I can tell you since this is locally, I make sure, we're going to Romania in a few weeks.
b	B.96 utt1	Oh.
 %	A.97 utt1	And that's, just .
qr	B.98 utt1	Did you say Romania or Armenia?
sd	A.99 utt1	R , Romania.
bk	B.102 utt1	okay.
b	B.102 utt2	Yeah,
b^r	B.102 utt3	yeah.
sd	A.103 utt1	As in, like, what Twenty Twenty and, but we're real excited because we've just developed a contact. Through professional people
ba	B.104 utt1	good.
sd	A.105 utt2	and it's private
sd	A.105 utt3	and it's hospital.
sd	A.105 utt4	we're just very excited .
ba	B.106 utt1	great.
sv	A.107 utt2	When you deal with issues like that, in terms of family building through adoption, and then you have people responding to you, well if you go through that why would you put them in daycare.
bd	B.108 utt1	that's silly.
sd	A.109 utt1	issues are being raised prematurely in my mind.
sd	A.109 utt2	But I guess they're not because it's something I'll have to deal with sooner than later.
sd	A.109 utt3	and what I've learned to do is just tune out everybody's opinion.
sd	A.109 utt4	I feel that if the child is healthy, and as long as we make it feel secure, I'd love to do something like with what you did.
b	B.110 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.111 utt1	I don't think I could be dumper where I could take it from, you know, eight in the morning till nine at night or six at night and leave it there.
b	B.112 utt1	Right.
sd	A.113 utt1	maybe after two or three years old.
h	A.113 utt2	I don't know.
sv	B.114 utt2	I mean your kids need you .
b	A.115 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.117 utt1	Well, they need a schedule I think.
sv	A.117 utt2	I don't think the United States,
qw	A.117 utt3	what country were you, in Europe when you were
ar	B.118 utt1	No,
sd	B.118 utt2	I was in the Middle East.
sv	A.119 utt2	Well, that's the same thing.
h	A.119 utt3	I mean I don't know how they are there
sd	A.119 utt4	but, in eastern Europe,
sd	A.119 utt5	my stepfather's from England,
sv	A.119 utt6	it just seems the United States does not provide for either child care or elder care, as I call it.
b	B.120 utt1	Right,
b^r	B.120 utt2	right.
sv	A.121 utt1	and we're just not set up for that.
b	B.122 utt2	yeah.
ad	A.123 utt1	Go ahead.
ar	B.124 utt1	No,
sd	B.124 utt2	I was just going to say, I guess, my sensitivities are much more with the, you know, to be at home.
sd	B.124 utt3	Because actually, I had my grandmother with me from the time she was ninety two until she died at ninety seven.
b	A.125 utt1	Uh huh.
ba	A.127 utt1	See, I think that's wonderful.
sd	B.128 utt1	And, I mean, that was recently after my son, was going off.
sd	B.128 utt3	in a sense, I went to work
sd	B.128 utt4	and she was at home alone some of the time.
sv	B.128 utt5	but still, you know, it was much better than being shipped to a daycare center. You know, which is much my feelings on kids and the elderly.
b	A.131 utt1	Right.
sv	B.132 utt2	I think we're too much towards it's somebody problem, you know.
^2	A.133 utt1	We cast off.
b	A.135 utt1	Right,
b^r	A.135 utt2	right.
sd	A.135 utt4	I'm that way.
^q	B.136 utt1	I want to work.
^q	B.136 utt2	Shove them in some school for twelve hours a day.
b	A.137 utt1	Right.
sv	A.137 utt2	It's easier
sv	A.137 utt3	and I agree with that.
b	B.138 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.139 utt2	what is amazing to me is now your son is already grown
sv	A.139 utt3	but you can probably empathize with this.
sd	A.139 utt4	It's amazing to me how forthcoming people are with their opinions and thoughts .
b	B.140 utt1	Right,
b^r	B.140 utt2	right.
sd	A.141 utt1	In terms of what to do.
sv	A.141 utt2	and I just don't think there is a good daycare system.
sd	A.141 utt3	my company, I'm particularly fortunate that they're in tune with that.
sd	A.141 utt4	But I've been at companies where, you know, the, the trend is, or the definite mood is, well we made conscious decisions not to have children.
ba@	B.142 utt1	And that's sad. Right.
sd	A.143 utt3	and a couple like us building through adoption, there, it's almost radical to some people.
sd	A.145 utt1	And what you just learn to do is tune everybody else out
sd	A.145 utt2	and, I respect, there are some women that I know that are divorced or on their own or in single parenting and men that you know, they may have the need for child care like that.
b	B.146 utt1	Uh huh.
ba	A.147 utt1	But I agree with you, that it's just, I call it dumping .
b	B.148 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.150 utt1	No,
sv	B.150 utt2	I think that certainly there is a role, for this type of help.
b	A.151 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.152 utt1	and as long as one can supervise it and, you know, make it work into one's own schedule without it seeming like dumping or or, or, giving it, you know, the whole job to somebody else to take care of.
b	A.153 utt1	Uh huh.
^2	A.155 utt1	Then, yeah,
sv	A.155 utt2	it's in tandem then.
b	B.158 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.158 utt2	yeah
sd	A.159 utt2	and there are trade offs too I think.
sv	A.159 utt3	One of the things that is a problem is in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers.
b	B.160 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.161 utt1	it's just, you know, it's so low
sd	A.161 utt2	but yet the overall cost for somebody doing it on a daily or even a weekly basis, it's prohibitive.
sd	A.161 utt3	And some people that are not making more than twenty thousand a year ...
b	B.162 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.164 utt1	Actually, there seems to be an alternative in my neighborhood.
b	A.165 utt1	Really.
 sv	B.166 utt1	there are several, u , m , mothers who stay home.
b	A.167 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.168 utt2	it's probably not completely legal .
sv	B.168 utt4	maybe it's legal up to one or two additional kids.
b	A.169 utt1	Sure.
sd	B.170 utt1	But, and they take care of another child
sd	B.170 utt2	and I could name five or six people around my neighborhood that really do a good job on this.
b	A.171 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.171 utt3	yeah.
sv	B.172 utt1	And I mean that's another possibility
sv	B.172 utt2	and, you know, you might want to stay home one year
sv	B.172 utt3	and some other lady might want to stay home for a few years
sd	A.173 utt1	I haven't thought about that.
b	A.173 utt2	Yeah.
sd	A.173 utt3	And actually my neighbor has an eighteen month old
sd	A.173 utt4	and she's at home part time paralegal.
b	B.174 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.174 utt2	yeah.
sd	A.175 utt1	And we get along fantastically
sv	A.175 utt3	And that's the way you have to,
sd	A.175 utt5	I'm just real curious.
qo	A.175 utt6	How was the Middle East in terms of that with children?
qy	A.175 utt7	is child care or that type of idea completely foreign to them?
nn	B.176 utt1	No.
sd	B.176 utt2	Well, actually there was a daycare center, where my son did go for a year.
sd	B.176 utt3	I think from when he was two to three.
b	A.177 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.178 utt1	But then he actually started kindergarten at age three.
b	A.179 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.180 utt1	And so, and you know, it wasn't like prekindergarten,
sd	B.180 utt2	it was real kindergarten.
b	A.181 utt1	really.
sv	A.181 utt2	He must be smart.
b	A.181 utt3	Yeah.
aa	B.182 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.182 utt2	So he was ready to go to school at that point.
b	A.183 utt1	Uh huh.
ny	B.184 utt1	But, yeah,
sd^e	B.184 utt2	they do have such facilities.
sv	B.184 utt3	But for the most part, with the extended family, you know, you can usually find somebody. Which is much like our neighbor you know, sharing responsibility.
b	A.185 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.186 utt2	and also there aren't that many women who d , who work.
sd	A.187 utt1	The professional.
b	A.187 utt2	Yeah,
sd	A.187 utt3	I was wondering about that.
b	B.188 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.189 utt2	I'm in Dallas
sd	A.189 utt3	and there was just a very big, series about Moslem women
sd	A.189 utt4	and there were enlightening things that broke some of my stereotypical thoughts.
b	B.190 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.191 utt2	I'm digressing here
qy^d	A.191 utt3	but, I was just real curious when you said Middle East, if you didn't mind me asking.
b	B.192 utt1	Yeah.
nn	B.194 utt1	No,
nn^r	B.194 utt2	no.
sd	B.194 utt3	And I didn't mean Israel.
qy^d	B.194 utt4	So you assumed right .
nn	A.195 utt1	no
bd	A.195 utt2	that's okay .
sd	A.195 utt3	Well, even if you did, that's okay actually.
nd	B.196 utt1	Well, no
sd	B.196 utt2	because at first thought, when you know, I said that not many people work, I'm thinking well she's going to, you know, because certainly in Israel the women do work .
b	A.197 utt1	Right.
b^r	A.197 utt2	Right.
sd	A.197 utt3	They fight,
sd	A.197 utt4	they work.
