o	A.1 utt1	Yes,
qw	A.1 utt2	what major changes have affected your life?
sd	B.2 utt1	Well, I think that, women working is the one that really affects me most strongly right now.
qr	A.3 utt1	You mean yourself, or women in general?
sd	B.4 utt1	Well, women in general, and also myself.
 b	A.5 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.6 utt1	But, it used to not really make a difference to me,
sd	B.6 utt2	or at least I didn't think so.
sd	B.6 utt3	But my mother worked,
sd	B.6 utt4	and I kind of now wish that she hadn't. that she had, stayed home,
b	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.8 utt2	and right now I'm kind of stuck because I'd like to have children,
sd	B.8 utt3	but I'm not ready to do that because when I do have children I want to stay home.
sd	B.8 utt4	So I'm having to, try to figure out a way to be able to do that.
b	A.9 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.10 utt1	And, in our society right now that's really something that's, not respected,
sv	B.10 utt2	and it's not, it's not easy to do at all.
b	A.11 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.12 utt2	I mean, there's a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family if the wife is going to actually be a mother.
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	A.13 utt2	uh huh.
sv	A.13 utt3	That's interesting,
sd	A.13 utt4	because that relates to the thing that strikes me the most,
sv	A.13 utt5	and I'm sure you've labelled the cause, because what strikes me the most in the changes in society is the way kids behave.
b	B.14 utt1	Uh huh,
sv	B.14 utt2	I think that they have to be related.
ba	A.15 utt1	That's right,
 ba^r	A.15 utt2	that's right.
sd	A.15 utt3	And you know, I mean I was thinking it just, you know,
sv	A.15 utt4	my complaint would be, that I think that, you know, the kids in the neighborhood run wild,
sv	A.15 utt5	and they destroy property,
sd	A.15 utt6	and they, you know, steal each other's toys and stuff
sv	A.15 utt7	and there's just no respect for people or property,
b	B.16 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.17 utt2	and I guess, you know, when you stop to think of it, these kids have probably been deprived of a lot of attention that they've needed all their lives.
b	B.18 utt1	Uh huh,
ba	B.18 utt2	I think that that's probably true.
sv	A.19 utt1	Scary,
sd	B.20 utt1	I just wish there was a way,
sd	B.20 utt2	I know that in, you know, in Sweden, what they have there, it's really their medical plan, but it also deals with this subject, because if a woman, is working and I think even if she's not, and has a child, the government subsidizes her to stay home and raise the child.
b	A.21 utt1	Uh huh
qw	A.23 utt1	But for how many years?
sd	B.24 utt1	I don't know.
b	A.25 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.26 utt2	I'm sure until at least school age, and maybe longer.
ba	A.27 utt1	that's great.
sv	B.28 utt1	What this does is, it allows the government to subsidize her to be the mother of her children rather than to subsidize child care
 b	A.29 utt1	Uh huh.
 +	B.30 utt1	to raise the child for her.
 b	A.31 utt1	Right.
 sv	B.32 utt1	And I think that that's a much, much more viable solution, really.
 b	A.33 utt1	Uh huh.
 aa	A.33 utt2	No,
aa	A.33 utt3	I agree, a hundred percent, a hundred percent.
sd	A.33 utt4	I guess I was lucky, because I was teaching,
sd	A.33 utt5	and so I was able to just go to a class and teach when my son was little,
sd	A.33 utt6	and so I'd be gone, you know, an hour and fifteen minutes or something at a stretch.
b	B.34 utt1	yeah,
ba	B.34 utt2	that's great.
b	A.35 utt1	And, then, yeah,
sd	A.35 utt2	very soon he was old enough to just go and sort of stay in my office
sd	A.35 utt3	and you know, nobody seemed to have a big problem with that .
b	B.36 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.37 utt2	So. That's an interesting issue though.
^h	B.38 utt1	goodness,
qw^t	B.38 utt2	what else?
sv	B.40 utt1	there's been so many,
qw	B.40 utt2	how do you just,
b	A.41 utt1	Right,
sd	A.41 utt3	actually a question I would have is,
sd	A.41 utt4	I guess I'm being, you know, beyond the age of thinking of this problem.
sd	A.41 utt5	I had an argument recently with my boss,
sd	A.41 utt6	I think it was, about the need for women to work.
sv	A.41 utt7	But I think you put your finger on it, when you said that they're not respected if they don't work, because it seems to me that a lot of people I know, women I know, are doing very menial jobs in a certain sense, certainly financially
b	B.42 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.43 utt1	and, I mean, when I see the amount of clothes that they buy and how much it costs them to buy fast food on the way home I'm sure that they're not quote making money for the family on this
b	B.44 utt1	Yeah,
b	B.44 utt2	uh huh.
b	B.46 utt1	Yeah,
b	B.46 utt2	really.
sv	A.47 utt1	and probably you're right.
sv	B.48 utt1	I don't see how they could be, especially not if they have to pay for child care.
ar	A.49 utt1	Well, no,
sd	A.49 utt2	even families that don't have child care,
sd	A.49 utt3	I mean, you know, when I think of this one friend who makes probably twenty thousand dollars a year, I'm sure she spends at least that in clothes, plus, you know, fast food every day, and out to lunch every day,
b	B.50 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.52 utt1	You're probably right.
sv	B.52 utt2	If she sat down and looked at it she'd be like, God, what am I doing this for, you know.
aa	A.53 utt1	Exactly,
sd	A.53 utt2	and I mean, you know, even though they don't have children, they have relatives
sd	A.53 utt3	and, you know, the husband would certainly like a lot more attention,
sd	A.53 utt4	and she wouldn't have to hire somebody to clean the house, and do the gardening .
sv	A.53 utt5	And, so, I guess you're right.
sv	A.53 utt7	our society demands women to work if they're going to be respected.
b	B.54 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.55 utt1	Really sad .
b	B.56 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.56 utt2	religion has changed, too.
ba	A.57 utt1	that's true.
sv	B.58 utt1	some people now it seems like are turning back toward actually trying to find out what they're in it for, instead of just,
sv	B.58 utt3	some places still it seems like it's a social club.
b	A.59 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.60 utt1	You know, it's just a place to go, to visit, to wear your nice clothes, and to sit around and talk,
sv	B.60 utt2	but, I think a lot of people are really, you know, searching now to find out who they are, and who God is, and what all that really means now.
b	A.61 utt1	Uh huh,
sv	A.61 utt2	so that might be a positive change in society.
b	B.62 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.62 utt2	it's, it's beginning, I think.
b	A.63 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	A.63 utt2	uh huh.
sd	A.63 utt3	I guess I haven't seen that as much in this area, although every now and then you hear about it.
b	B.64 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.65 utt1	but among, you know, people I know, I don't see a great, you know,
sv	A.65 utt2	there are those people who have had serious questions all along, and, you know, are sort of pursuing it
 b	B.66 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.67 utt1	but, the churches here are growing, leaps and bounds,
sv	A.67 utt2	and I thought it was more because of the very transient nature of the area and that people were going basically just as you said, as a social to meet people, and that,
b	B.68 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.69 utt2	but, it's hard to judge,
sv	A.69 utt3	and there are a lot of things changing, I suppose,
b	B.70 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.71 utt1	Just, you know, the whole environment, I find sort of, you know,
b	B.72 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.73 utt2	I wonder with all our chemicals and that and the foods we eat,
sd	A.73 utt3	and, you know, young people that I know are getting very serious diseases
b	B.74 utt1	yes.
sv	B.74 utt2	Well, I guess that's always happened.
b	A.75 utt1	Probably.
sv	B.76 utt1	Maybe not as much as now
sv	A.77 utt2	maybe it's more unusual now, when, you know, somebody quite young gets certain kinds of cancer,
sv	A.77 utt3	and in the past, maybe the same percentage got them,
sv	A.77 utt4	but we didn't know it,
h	A.77 utt5	or, I don't know.
sv^t	A.77 utt6	Well, I guess we've sort of run dry a little bit.
b	B.78 utt1	Okay .
fc	A.79 utt1	It was nice talking to you.
fc	B.80 utt1	Nice to talk to you.
fc	A.81 utt1	Okay.
fc	A.81 utt2	Bye bye.
fc	B.82 utt1	Bye bye.
