qw	A.1 utt1	So what movies have you seen?
sd	B.2 utt1	well, I have, seen DANCES WITH WOLVES, which is probably the best movie that I have seen lately.
sd	B.2 utt2	I do not go out to films very often. So, as far as out of the house.
b	A.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.4 utt2	So we do get a lot of videos that we bring in,
sd	B.6 utt1	and I see some that way.
sd	B.6 utt2	But, I am not real current on films.
qo	B.6 utt3	How about you?
o	A.7 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.7 utt2	I saw DANCES WITH WOLVES and, HOME ALONE
sd	B.8 utt1	I hear that is really good, but I have not seen it yet.
aa	A.9 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.9 utt2	It is.
b	B.10 utt1	Yeah
sd	A.11 utt1	It is about a little kid that his parents go off to Paris.
b	B.12 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.13 utt1	And they forget all about him.
sd	A.15 utt1	they take a head count and the oldest daughter counts one of the neighbor kids instead of,
ba	B.16 utt1	cute.
sd	A.17 utt1	And he is up in the attic asleep because he got in trouble.
ba	B.18 utt1	dear.
sd	A.19 utt1	So she made him go sleep upstairs.
b	B.20 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.21 utt1	And there is, there is a couple of burglars, breaking into the houses in the neighborhood.
^2	B.24 utt1	and he hears them or something
aa	A.25 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.25 utt2	And he sets up traps for them all over the house.
qw	B.26 utt1	Who wins?
 sd	A.27 utt1	he does.
 ba	B.28 utt1	great,
 ba^r	B.28 utt2	great.
 	sd        B.28 utt4	I had heard people talk about it,
 	sd        B.28 utt5	and they say it was really cute, but I had not seen it.
 	b        A.29 utt1	Uh huh.
 	sd        B.30 utt1	we usually wait
 	sd        B.30 utt2	and eventually it comes out on video,
 	sd        B.30 utt3	and then we get it and see it that way.
 	b        A.31 utt1	Right.
sd	B.32 utt1	And that is, it,
sd	B.32 utt2	movies are very expensive.
sd	B.32 utt3	movie theatres here, they are six dollars, for evening performances.
sv	B.32 utt4	And that is kind of steep,
b	A.33 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.34 utt1	I think.
sd	B.34 utt2	I don't know.
qw	B.34 utt3	How much is it in Dallas?
sd	A.35 utt1	Well, it is six dollars,
sd	A.35 utt2	but you get, matinee prices.
 %	A.35 utt3	But,
b	B.36 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.36 utt2	You can do that, but it is difficult if you, if you work or, you know,
b	A.37 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.38 utt1	that is taking the middle of the afternoon.
 sd	B.38 utt2	And if I am looking for entertainment usually I, have more, time in the evening than I do in the middle of the day to, see things.
 	qo        B.38 utt3	What do you think of movies in general?
 	qo        B.38 utt4	As far as the trends?
 sd	A.39 utt1	Well, I think they are a lot better than they were,
sd	A.39 utt2	well, like, in the early eighties or during the, like the SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT era.
b	B.40 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.41 utt1	When it was,
 sv	A.41 utt3	I do not think they were very good during that time.
 	b        B.42 utt1	Yeah.
 	sv        A.43 utt1	At least
 	b        B.44 utt1	Did,
 	+        A.45 utt1	there were not as many good ones.
 	b       B.46 utt1	Yeah.
 	sd       B.46 utt2	The quality I think maybe has improved in that respect.
 	b        A.47 utt1	Uh huh.
 sv	B.48 utt1	the only thing that disturbs me is that now they think they have to add just a little bit of sex and violence in order to get a tougher rating. Which suggests that, you know, it will be more enticing to the, to the public.
sv	B.48 utt2	And a lot of times it is added for no real, valid reason.
 b	A.49 utt1	Uh huh.
 sv	B.50 utt1	which does not make,
 	sv        B.50 utt2	and I think SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT was a little bit like that.
b	A.51 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.52 utt1	but DANCES WITH WOLVES did not seem to have anything added.
sv	B.52 utt2	It was just all legitimate kind of, film.
sv	B.52 utt3	And that is where reason why I suppose it won so many Oscars,
sv	B.52 utt4	because it really was good even though it is such a long movie.
sd(^q)	B.52 utt5	You know, they said, "Oh, people won't be interested in a three hour movie." But it certainly gotten good acclaim everywhere it has gone.
sv	A.53 utt1	And it was shocking at the end too.
b	B.54 utt1	yeah.
b	A.55 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.56 utt1	Absolutely.
sv	B.56 utt2	but much more true to life
sv	B.56 utt3	and I think that is the point.
aa	A.57 utt1	Yeah.
ba	A.57 utt2	That is right.
 sd	B.58 utt1	they do not have to keep making up stuff if they want to make something good.
b	A.59 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.60 utt1	I hate sequels too.
sd	B.60 utt2	I hate these, you know, number one, two, three, four.
b	A.61 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.62 utt1	Usually if a movie is good, once is enough .
aa	A.63 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.63 utt2	Especially JAWS.
b	B.64 utt1	Right.
sd	B.64 utt2	That was on Prime Time Television here, recently at seven thirty in the evening.
sv	B.64 utt3	And, it was kind of shocking because that is a scary movie. And children, young children could have seen that movie, at that hour.
 b	A.65 utt1	Uh huh.
 sd	B.66 utt2	And I thought, you know, that would not have been the sort of thing I would have wanted my children to see at that age, I mean when they were young.
 sd	B.66 utt3	And here it was quite easily seen by anybody that turned on the T V.
 b	A.67 utt1	Right.
 sd	B.68 utt1	which was a,
 sv	B.68 utt2	it was a good movie.
 sv	B.68 utt3	I mean it was well done but, that is one reason why it was scary.
b	A.69 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.70 utt1	So, but I do not know that I have seen any of the, sequels to that.
sv	B.70 utt2	I think one is enough.
b	A.71 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.73 utt1	Just more of the same.
b@	B.74 utt1	Yes, uh huh.
sd	B.74 utt2	That is what people say.
 sd	A.75 utt1	In one of them they have a mother shark, destroy a whole, marina and aquarium.
 b	B.76 utt1	Oh.
 +	A.77 utt1	Which is kind of far fetched.
aa	B.78 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.78 utt3	just a touch.
b	A.79 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.82 utt1	Well, the whole movie is kind of far fetched.
b	A.83 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.84 utt1	But, I mean the whole idea behind it is far fetched.
sv	A.85 utt1	They hardly ever play music when a shark attacks somebody.
sv	B.86 utt1	not too often .
b	A.87 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.88 utt1	That has gotten to be a whole camp idea now though, you know.
sv	B.88 utt2	If you hear that music, you know, everybody knows what you are talking about.
b	A.89 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.90 utt1	It's funny.
sv	B.90 utt2	Well, it sounds like neither one of us are real movie buffs.
 sd	A.91 utt1	Well, every once in a while, I go, but it has to be like somebody that I like
b	B.92 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.93 utt1	you know. I did not go see FIELD OF DREAMS when it was in the theatre because I did not know it was any good.
 b	B.94 utt1	Uh huh.
 sd	A.95 utt1	And then I, I found out it was Kevin Costner when it was on, I guess A B C the other week,
 %	A.95 utt2	then I,
b	B.96 utt1	Right.
b	B.96 utt2	Yeah.
sd@	B.96 utt3	I saw it then too. Yeah.
b	A.97 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.97 utt2	And then I really liked it.
sv	B.98 utt2	It was good.
b	A.99 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.100 utt1	It was very good.
 sd	B.100 utt2	But, see I have, teenagers in my house.
 sd	B.100 utt3	And of course sometimes they rent movies and, you know, have friends over or something.
sd	B.100 utt4	And sometimes movies are here that I am not even aware that I could have seen, you know.
sd	B.100 utt5	Because my family tells me that, that it had been actually in the house before .
 sd	B.102 utt1	But I had missed it.
 sd	B.102 utt2	But I did see it on T V,
 sd	B.102 utt3	and I thought it was good.
 b	A.103 utt1	Yeah.
 %	A.103 utt2	It was really,
 	sv        A.103 utt3	and then, and then, Shoeless Joe Jackson really was a player.
 	sd        A.103 utt4	I thought they made him up, and then I found out, you know, after I saw the movie that, they started talking about that scandal
bh	B.104 utt1	really?
ny	A.105 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.105 utt2	when the anniversary came up
b	B.106 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.107 utt1	that was around the time of anniversary, you know.
b	B.108 utt1	No kidding.
sd	A.109 utt1	And then it was on the news.
sd	B.110 utt1	I did not realize that.
b	B.112 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.112 utt2	you know, the character that, James Earle Jones played?
b	A.113 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.114 utt1	I teach in school,
sd	B.114 utt2	and we are doing a book called INVISIBLE MAN by Ralph Ellison.
b	A.115 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.116 utt1	And I wondered if maybe he was patterned after him.
b	A.117 utt1	Yeah.
h	B.118 utt1	I do not know,
sd	B.118 utt2	I had not heard anybody talk about it.
sv	B.118 utt3	But, he certainly could have been. which was kind of interesting. You know, someone who was a real activist but then took up the cause. kind of gave up, you know, because he did not think anything was happening,
b	A.119 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.120 utt2	so, it was kind of fun.
b	A.121 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.121 utt2	And I wondered who it was too.
h	B.122 utt1	I do not know for sure,
sv	B.122 utt2	but there are certain, qualities that suggest it could be he.
sd	B.122 utt3	Because they were suggesting that this Ben was something of a recluse.
sd	B.122 utt4	That he had stopped writing and had stopped, you know,
sd	B.122 utt5	and that is true for Ellison.
sd	B.122 utt6	he wrote that one book and a few essays and that is about it. has pretty much dropped out of public life.
b	A.123 utt1	Huh.
sd	B.124 utt2	But he is still alive
sv	B.124 utt3	and you know, that is what makes it so interesting.
b	A.125 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	B.126 utt1	And that book, have you ever read that book? INVISIBLE MAN.
br	A.129 utt1	What is that?
qy^d	A.129 utt2	INVISIBLE MAN?
qy^d	B.130 utt1	INVISIBLE MAN by Ralph Ellison.
 nn	A.131 utt1	no.
 nn	A.131 utt2	Huh uh.
 sv	B.132 utt1	It is an incredible book.
 sv	B.132 utt2	It, really is very interesting.
 sd	B.132 utt3	I highly recommend it.
qy	A.133 utt1	did they make the movies after that
 %	B.134 utt1	the,
 %	B.134 utt2	yeah,
 %	B.134 utt3	the movie,
 	%        B.134 utt4	the
 	%        B.134 utt5	in
sd	B.134 utt6	FIELD OF DREAMS came out after, that novel.
b	A.135 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.136 utt1	So it could easily have been patterned after him.
 sd	B.136 utt2	But the movie did not have anything to do with the story that I am talking about.
 b	A.137 utt1	Right.
 sv	B.138 utt1	I just thought the, author could have been patterned after that,
 sv	B.138 utt2	I mean that character could have been patterned after him or someone like him, certainly.
b	A.139 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	@B.140 utt1	Sort of interesting,
qy^g^t	@B.140 utt2	so. Well, I guess we have talked probably our time limit, haven't we?
aa	A.141 utt1	yeah.
fc	B.142 utt1	Okay.
fc	A.143 utt1	Okay.
fc	A.143 utt2	It was n , Nice talking to you.
fc	B.144 utt1	Very good.
fc	B.144 utt2	It was nice talking to you.
fc	B.146 utt1	Okay.
fc	B.146 utt2	Bye bye.
fc^m	A.147 utt1	Bye bye.
