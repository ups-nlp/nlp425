o	A.1 utt1	Okay .
ad	A.1 utt2	I'll let you go ahead .
aa	B.2 utt1	Okay.
sd	B.2 utt2	I have five children all together.
b	A.3 utt1	uh huh.
sd	B.4 utt1	my oldest two are already out and about in the world
sd	B.4 utt2	and I, have a set of twins that are fourteen
b	A.5 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.6 utt1	and, my youngest is twelve.
ba	A.7 utt1	That's great.
sd	A.7 utt2	I always thought it'd be great to have twins.
b	B.8 utt1	yeah.
sv	B.8 utt2	If you like doing everything twice .
b	A.9 utt1	Well, yeah
sd	B.10 utt1	at any rate, my first two children, I didn't spend a whole lot of time with them.
b	A.11 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.12 utt1	and, you know, was a problem with having five children needing to work a full time job that, was more than a full time job.
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.14 utt2	I, worked about fifty one hours a week, because I worked eleven hours every Sunday.
b	A.15 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.17 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.18 utt1	And, so I didn't get to spend as much time with them as I should have, as I really wanted to.
qy	A.19 utt1	Your first ones you mean, it, was this way?
ny	B.20 utt1	Yeah.
ny	B.22 utt1	yeah,
sd	B.22 utt3	well, it was with all of them,
b	A.23 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.24 utt1	but it was, more an impact, I think, on the oldest two.
b	A.25 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.26 utt1	Because, about the time I got out of working that long hours was when the twins were about three years old.
sd	B.26 utt2	And, you know, I don't think they noticed I wasn't around that much.
b	A.27 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.28 utt1	You know, with all the children around the house, it's, kind of hard to notice that Dad isn't around, very much.
b	A.29 utt1	Right.
sd	B.32 utt2	so, what I've tried to do, now that I've,
sd	B.32 utt3	went back to school and got my degree when I was thirty years old.
b	A.33 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.34 utt1	And, so, then I came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as I did fifty one hours, a week.
b	A.35 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.36 utt2	So, I've tried to spend more time with, the children since then.
b	A.37 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.38 utt1	what I'm currently doing is, taking a lot of time.
sd	B.38 utt2	I'm helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings.
sd	B.38 utt3	we just started a thing where every other week we go to, movies.
sd	B.38 utt4	There's a movie theater that offers dollar movies on Wednesday nights.
b	A.39 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.40 utt1	And so, every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the, movies.
b	A.41 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.42 utt2	And, it's working out pretty well.
sd	B.42 utt3	we're spending more time together.
sd	B.42 utt4	I feel like I'm a lot closer to the three that are still living at home than I ever was to the two that were living there before.
b	A.43 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.44 utt1	in fact, I found that I'm a lot closer with,
sd	B.44 utt2	I have one son who's gone
sd	B.44 utt3	and I don't even know where he's at.
b	A.45 utt1	Huh.
sd	B.46 utt1	he's taken off for parts unknown,
ba	A.47 utt1	That's difficult.
aa	B.48 utt1	but, yeah.
b	A.49 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.50 utt2	and, my daughter has moved out of the house.
sd	B.50 utt3	Her and I get along a lot better now that she's moved out of the house .
b	A.51 utt1	Uh huh
sd	B.52 utt1	And so it's, it's, it's been difficult to try to find the time,
sd	B.52 utt2	and I think it's important that we do, because, I notice that, when I had spent two years down in Dallas, down there they all have a me kind of attitude.
b	A.53 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.54 utt1	And I noticed parents not spending time with their, children and going out and doing things.
b	A.55 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.56 utt2	And, you know, I knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine
b	A.57 utt1	uh huh.
sd	B.58 utt2	I saw the family falling apart down, there.
sv	A.59 utt1	Texas is, much worst for the drugs.
sv	A.61 utt2	I mean, it was bad enough every place else,
sd	A.61 utt3	but drugs in Texas, are extremely bad.
b	B.62 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.62 utt2	And so, I think it's kind of important that I, you know, nurture the relationship I have with my children now.
b	A.63 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.64 utt1	And I'm doing my best to keep that up.
b	A.65 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.67 utt1	Well, that's all you can do.
b	B.68 utt1	Yeah.
qw	B.68 utt2	What's been your experience?
qy	A.69 utt1	Well, I was going to ask, too, does your wife work?
na	B.70 utt1	she didn't up until the last, six months.
b	A.71 utt1	Uh huh.
qy^d	A.73 utt1	She just recently started working then.
na^m	B.74 utt1	She just recently, started working.
b	A.75 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.76 utt2	she worked a job until we moved to our new house
sd	B.76 utt3	and, she quit that job because it was too inconvenient.
sd	B.76 utt4	And, she starts a new job tomorrow, which should take her out of the house about four days a week.
b	A.77 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.79 utt1	uh huh.
b^r	A.79 utt2	Uh huh.
ba	A.79 utt3	So, that sounds great.
sd	A.79 utt4	Well, we also have five children.
b	B.80 utt1	Huh.
sd	A.81 utt1	And, but ours are all out of the nest .
sd	A.83 utt1	So, when they were growing up, probably we had a lot of similar things like you had, you know, having the time.
sv	A.83 utt2	When you have younger ones to take care of, you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones.
b	B.84 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.85 utt1	But, we're very active, of course, at church, and, Boy Scouting, and Girl Scouts, Four H,
sd	A.85 utt2	and those activities helped a lot in, giving us things to do with the children.
b	B.86 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.87 utt2	And we try to take a vacation with them every year, camping of some sort, something that wasn't expensive.
sd	A.87 utt3	And, our youngest is, expecting her first baby.
sd	A.87 utt4	So, they're all out and on their own.
sd	A.87 utt6	and we have one to get married yet .
sd	A.87 utt7	And they'll all be married.
sd	A.87 utt8	and they're all doing pretty good.
qy^d	A.87 utt10	T lives in Pittsburgh, you probably don't know where that is.
na	B.88 utt1	Certainly do.
bk	A.89 utt1	Okay.
sd	A.89 utt2	Two of our children live there.
sd	A.89 utt3	one, like I said, lives in, in around Maryland, D C.
sd	A.89 utt4	He works right on the border of D C.
b	B.90 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.91 utt1	And one lives in Connecticut
sd	A.91 utt2	and our baby lives just a mile over the hill , so, we'll get to see her a little more than, what we do the other ones.
b	B.94 utt1	Yeah.
ba	B.94 utt2	That sounds great.
sd	B.94 utt3	I've noticed, another thing, when I was younger my father was always working.
b	A.95 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.95 utt2	Well, they have to.
b	B.98 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.99 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.100 utt1	And, you know, he worked a full time job and a part time job,
b	A.101 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.102 utt1	and I never saw him.
b	A.103 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.104 utt1	So, I didn't have much of a role model to go by. {D You, know, } to learn how to be a father and, a parent, and that kind of thing, because, I can't ever remember playing ball with my dad or, catch with my dad, or doing anything with my dad.
^2	A.105 utt1	To go, to follow.
b	A.107 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.109 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.111 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.113 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.115 utt1	And that does make a big difference.
aa	B.116 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.116 utt6	it's my feeling that if you don't have a role model to follow then it's kind of tough.
b	A.117 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.119 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.120 utt1	You know, everybody's not FATHER KNOWS BEST.
b	A.121 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.122 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.125 utt2	well none of us are.
sv	A.125 utt3	Let's face it, you know, we're not none of us like they portray it on those shows.
b	B.126 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.127 utt2	I mean, life's much more difficult than that.
b	B.128 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.130 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.130 utt2	{E I, mean, } the, the capability to, create children doesn't necessarily mean you have the, the mental capacity to raise them .
b	A.133 utt1	Right.
b^r	A.133 utt2	Right.
sd	A.135 utt1	Now, our daughter, well, she's our second oldest, she's the only other one that has children.
sd	A.135 utt2	She has two boys.
sd	A.135 utt3	And, she works full time
sd	A.135 utt4	and I have mixed feelings about that.
sd	A.135 utt5	She's able to do that
sd	A.135 utt6	and I don't know if she'd be happy to stay at home.
sd	A.135 utt7	But, yet, on the other hand, I've got the mixed feelings that I think you should be at home with your children.
sd	A.135 utt8	I'm kind of old fashioned, I guess, that way.
b	B.136 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.137 utt1	But they seem to give, quality time to those children when they are together.
sd	A.137 utt2	and so, it seems for them that it works out all right.
h	A.137 utt3	So, I don't know.
sd	A.137 utt4	I don't think I ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family.
b	B.138 utt1	Yes.
sv	B.140 utt1	it's not easy.
b	A.141 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.142 utt1	you know, I've helped out extremely,
sd	B.142 utt2	well, I can't say that,
sd	B.142 utt3	but I've helped out , as best I could at home.
b	A.143 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.145 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.146 utt1	And, as you know, with five children it takes a lot of work.
aa	A.147 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.147 utt2	It does, it,
sv	B.148 utt1	Even, if, even if someone's home all the time, there's still a lot of things that have to be done.
b	A.151 utt1	Yeah.
qw	A.151 utt2	What line of work are you in now since you went to school
o@	A.151 utt3	and, * slash error  okay.
sd	B.152 utt1	well, now I work for Texas Instruments.
sd	B.154 utt1	So, so, I'm in computers.
bk	A.157 utt1	Okay.
sd	A.157 utt2	A lot of the people I've talked to work for, for the same.
b	B.158 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.160 utt2	prior to that I worked in a food store.
b	A.161 utt1	Uh huh.
qy^d	A.163 utt1	Which your income would be a lot better, now.
o@	B.164 utt1	* slash error right. / * slash error
b	A.167 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.168 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.168 utt2	it was, it was a smart move to make.
b	A.169 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.170 utt1	 I was more intelligent than the position I was holding.
b	A.171 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.173 utt1	Right.
sv	A.175 utt1	And it's, kind of a waste of a person.
aa	B.178 utt1	Yes.
sd	B.178 utt2	I, felt that it certainly was,
o	A.179 utt1	You know.
sd	B.180 utt2	I mean, I was smarter than most of the people that I was working for.
b	A.181 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.183 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.184 utt1	And, you know, every time something new came up, I was explaining it to them.
b	A.185 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.187 utt1	Uh huh.
qy^d	A.189 utt1	And you, you recognized this and, was able to, you know, do something about it.
o	B.192 utt1	No .
ny	B.194 utt1	Yeah.
ny	B.196 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.196 utt2	I, started back to school.
sd	B.196 utt3	In fact, I was going to school while I was working fifty one hours a week
sv	B.196 utt5	you know if you're working, if you're taking twelve credits at night and you're working fifty one hours a week, there's not much time left to spend with,
b	A.197 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.199 utt1	Well, it puts a strain on everybody, your wife and your family.
b	B.200 utt1	Yeah
sv	A.201 utt1	And, the only thing you can remember is to try and stay together as much as you can, because it's very easy to, go your own direction when you're working so hard and going to school, too.
b	B.204 utt1	Yeah
b	B.206 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.206 utt2	Well, it all paid off.
ba	A.207 utt1	Well, that's wonderful.
sd	B.208 utt1	So, you know, I got my degree and got the better paying job,
sd	B.208 utt2	and and, you know, I think as a family we're a lot better off.
b	A.209 utt1	Uh huh .
b	A.211 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.211 utt2	It sounds to me like, you're doing well.
sd	A.211 utt3	My husband's retired,
sd	A.211 utt4	so, he's been retired for three years now.
b	B.212 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.213 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.213 utt2	That's quite a change.
b	B.214 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.214 utt2	well, my goal is to try to retire by the time I'm fifty five.
sd	A.215 utt1	well, he made it at fifty .
ba	B.216 utt1	Great.
sd	A.217 utt1	It was a magic number for him
sd	A.217 utt2	and, he went at fifty,
sd	A.217 utt3	and he still works part time at other thing, you know, same job as he was doing, only he's retired and doing it independently.
b	B.218 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.219 utt1	But, nevertheless retired.
