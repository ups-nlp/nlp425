qo	A.1 utt1	So, what is your latest experience with painting?
sd	B.2 utt2	I haven't done any painting since I was a child
sd	B.2 utt3	and my father would be painting and I'd ask him if I could, you know, take a turn or something,
b	A.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.4 utt1	when we bought our home it was recently updated.
sd	B.4 utt2	They did that, maybe improvements, so they could sell it and things,
sd	B.4 utt3	so we didn't have to do any painting.
b	A.5 utt1	Right.
sd	B.6 utt1	And the condominium we moved in before, my husband went over and painted,
sd	B.6 utt3	the experience that I've had is that, whatever time he said, it would take me just about four hours, because it was only about like eleven or twelve hundred square feet over there,
sd	B.8 utt2	and he said, it's going to be just about four hours.
sd	B.8 utt3	Well, he was gone the whole day,
sd(^q)	B.8 utt4	and he said, Well, all I got done was the taping around .
bh	A.9 utt1	Isn't that amazing?
sd	A.11 utt1	it looks so easy just slapping paint on.
sd	A.11 utt2	I had an addition put on
b	B.12 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.13 utt1	and I decided, because my inner room looked so dingy, because I put these beautiful French doors in
b	B.18 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.19 utt1	and, so I decided, okay, I'll just, you know, have them paint this little room, you know, a little ten by ten dining area.
b	B.20 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.21 utt1	It took four days.
sd	A.23 utt1	And even the painter couldn't give me a good estimate.
sd	A.23 utt2	He said, Well, I'll be done this afternoon, you know
b	B.24 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.25 utt1	and pretty soon, before you know it, you know, he's run into so many problems,
sd	A.25 utt3	there's nothing there to be a problem I thought,
sd	A.25 utt4	but, it just took him so much longer,
sd	A.25 utt5	and and he was there to paint the French doors also.
b	B.26 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.27 utt2	and if you've ever painted French doors, which my husband just finally said he wasn't going to do , because it looked so formidable,
b	B.30 utt1	Yeah.
ad	A.31 utt1	then just ,
sd	A.33 utt1	we got this painter,
sd	A.33 utt2	and I just called him because I got a little ad out of you know, the adcose or whatever in the mail, and, you know, just got this painter person over here.
sd(^q)	A.33 utt3	And he said, Yeah, I can finish it in a day.
fe	A.33 utt4	right.
sd	A.33 utt5	so the whole project basically took a week .
ba	B.34 utt1	I know,
sd	B.36 utt1	it's just awful.
sd	A.37 utt1	Funny.
sd(^q)	A.37 utt2	And I go what makes you a professional? You know?
^q	A.39 utt1	How much, you know, more do you know than I know about this whole situation,
sd	A.39 utt2	but he just kept painting on those French doors, you know,
sd	A.39 utt3	and each little, paint stroke, you know, the paint wasn't going on right is what it was.
^2	B.40 utt1	Pane.
b	B.42 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.43 utt1	So he had to redo them like three times before I was happy with them, before he was happy, you know, that they even looked halfway decent,
sd	A.43 utt2	and so } it's just been painting, yeah,
sd	A.45 utt2	I mean, hire a professional,
sv	A.45 utt3	but that doesn't guarantee anything .
aa	B.46 utt1	No,
sv	B.46 utt3	like you said, always takes way longer than anyone, is able to guess, because I know my husband he painted, when he,
sd	B.46 utt4	it was just the preparation time was so long. That when he actually got down to the painting part, ,
b	A.47 utt1	Right.
 +	B.50 utt1	it was like ten times longer than he already thought he would be done,
sd	B.50 utt2	and, he did part of the, at night because we were trying to hurry up and get it ready so we could move in,
sd	B.50 utt3	and he didn't notice until the next morning that he had finished one can off and started another one.
 ba	A.51 utt1	no.
sd	B.52 utt1	And then we went in there, you know, one was, bu ,
sd	B.52 utt2	they were white,
sd	B.52 utt3	but one had more blue to it.
sv	A.53 utt1	and that can make a difference, too.
b	B.54 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.55 utt2	I mean, and they bring the, you know, little samples
b	B.56 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.57 utt1	and you've got like maybe, five hundred,
sd	A.57 utt2	well that's an exaggeration,
sd	A.57 utt3	but there are just so many tints upon tints upon tints,
sv	A.57 utt4	and you don't know what you to want to, put up there,
sd	A.59 utt2	and by the time it's on, I, I
sd	A.59 utt3	selected what I thought was white,
sd	A.59 utt4	and it was like you said, you know, it was blue blue cast to it.
b	B.60 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.62 utt1	Uh huh.
 sv	A.63 utt1	And it looked awful on .
sd	A.65 utt1	So that was the next problem.
sd	A.65 utt2	He had to redo that too.
b	B.66 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.67 utt2	and it was a major project getting the money together to do it too, by the end, of the whole project,
b	B.68 utt1	Right.
sd	A.69 utt2	but, you know, we worked something out, because he was kind of apologetic that it took so long.
sd	A.69 utt3	He really came over here to paint, I think, because he kept offering to paint the outside of my house ,
sv	A.71 utt1	I don't think he did the interiors very well .
ba	B.72 utt1	boy.
sd	B.74 utt1	Well, I don't recall my parents having that much trouble .
b	A.75 utt1	No .
sd	B.76 utt1	I mean, you know, they painted our rooms all the time,
sd	B.76 utt2	and we had a wooden,
sd	B.76 utt3	we hardly,
sd	B.76 utt4	we just had brick on like as accent on a certain area of our home growing up,
b	A.77 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.78 utt2	and so he had to paint the outside all the time.
sd	B.78 utt3	and, I just don't think, you know, that there was that big problem .
sd	A.79 utt1	It wasn't a big deal for them.
b	B.80 utt1	No,
sd	B.82 utt2	we're going, we're so glad we have a brick home, all we have is like trim around the windows or something,
 sd	A.83 utt1	I think my husband's really glad about that .
sd	B.84 utt1	No, no painting to have to do.
ba	A.85 utt1	For sure.
 %	B.86 utt2	I don't know that w ,
sd	B.86 utt3	like, say, we're freshly graduated from school and things,
sd	B.86 utt4	so we haven't gotten to the point where we're hiring professionals to do too much of our needs.
sd	A.87 utt1	you just get in there and do it yourself.
sd	B.88 utt1	We've been trying,
b	A.89 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.90 utt1	you know, we've done that the whole time we were in school. Like, trying to repair our own cars,
b	A.91 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.92 utt2	and, so } I want to get to the point where I could feel like I could just hire someone .
b	A.93 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.95 utt1	Well, it's not that easy.
sv	A.95 utt2	It's like, it's,
sd	A.95 utt3	I don't even know if you know, I would not even recommend this person again to anybody.
h	A.95 utt4	I don't know.
b	B.96 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.97 utt3	I don't know if you get into the mind set where you just say, Well, I'll accept something, or you just really have to get on their back, I mean, about things and working with what they say are professional painters.
b	B.98 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.101 utt1	I tell you what, the fumes that the paint gives off makes you wonder what these people do any ,
ba	B.102 utt1	That's true.
sd	A.103 utt1	I mean the fumes are amazing,
sd	A.103 utt2	and I don't think I could stay sane, you know , working with all that.
b	B.106 utt1	No.
sd	A.107 utt2	So, I mean, I know it's not lead based any more, paints,
fe	A.107 utt3	but, my goodness .
 ^2	B.108 utt1	But, still, it's harmful,
sd	B.110 utt2	and they have to live with that every day in their clothes and everything.
sv	A.111 utt3	I, think so .
ba	A.113 utt1	it does.
sd	B.114 utt1	The only painting job that was really painless for us was in this condominium that the, association that manages it, they have to take care of like the structural damage.
sd	B.114 utt2	there was a roof leak,
sd	B.114 utt3	and that was not something that we had to pay for.
sd	B.114 utt4	So they sent their painters in to repaint a corner of the ceiling and then, you know, repaint the whole ceiling, in a certain room.
b	A.115 utt1	Oh.
b	A.117 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.118 utt1	But they came in and did it and left in just no time at all,
sd	B.118 utt2	and I think it's because you know, they were accustomed to working in that environment, in those particular condominiums,
sd	B.118 utt3	and I didn't watch them,
sv	B.118 utt4	but I couldn't imagine that they came in and painted it, the whole ceiling, you know, just within a couple of hours.
b	A.119 utt1	Right .
sd	A.121 utt1	Well, maybe there are some professionals out there .
sv	A.123 utt1	It makes you wonder .
b	B.124 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.125 utt1	Really, it does, for all that.
fc	A.129 utt1	Well, I hope you have a nice day today.
fc	B.130 utt1	Well, you too,
fc	A.131 utt1	And you take care.
fc	B.132 utt1	I guess it's getting to be lunch time,
fc	B.132 utt2	I need to go take care of the kids
fc	B.132 utt3	but,
fc	A.133 utt1	Okay.
fc	B.134 utt1	You have a good day.
fc	A.135 utt1	Okay.
fc	A.135 utt2	Bye, Kay.
fc	B.136 utt1	Bye.
