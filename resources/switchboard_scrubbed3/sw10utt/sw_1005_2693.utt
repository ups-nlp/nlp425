o	A.1 utt1	All right,
ad	A.1 utt2	do you want to start out?
aa	B.2 utt1	Well, it'll be real easy for us,
sd	B.4 utt1	because my husband and I are vegetarians.
qy	A.5 utt1	are you really?
ny	B.6 utt1	So, yeah.
sd^e	B.6 utt2	So the first thing we look for, is if we can eat there or not.
bk	A.7 utt1	Oh.
qy	A.9 utt1	Are you strict vegetarians?
ng	B.10 utt1	We're not vegan vegetarians.
sd	B.10 utt2	we're ovolacto.
sd	B.10 utt3	We do eat, eggs and milk products.
b	A.11 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.12 utt1	I used to be a complete vegan vegetarian, where I didn't eat any animal products at all.
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.15 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.16 utt1	But, it's really difficult in the area if you don't have, you know, the products that you can get.
sd	B.16 utt2	And if you go out to dinner, you know, there's not a whole lot of things you can get.
 sv	A.17 utt1	There's very few places I'll bet that you could,
b	B.18 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.18 utt2	I think maybe if you were somewhere like California, where they have a lot more vegetarian restaurants and stuff.
b	A.19 utt1	Uh huh.
 sd	B.20 utt2	But here, basically, you go to an Italian restaurant or you go to a Mexican restaurant, you know, you know, where you have a little bit more variety as far as the pastas or the the corn meal, you know, or something.
b	A.21 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.23 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.25 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.27 utt1	And you wouldn't have the meat products in that
b	A.31 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.32 utt1	yeah,
sv	B.32 utt2	you have to watch that too.
sd	B.32 utt3	you know, some of the restaurants here they will, you know, l ,
sd	B.32 utt4	you can ask them and they'll tell you whether or not they use like lard or, you know, animal fat to cook with.
b	A.33 utt1	Uh huh.
 b	A.35 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.36 utt2	we don't really eat out too much.
b	A.37 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.38 utt1	we tend to eat at home.
sd	B.38 utt2	And actually, you know, I think we, we get a ha , we have a healthier diet than the average person.
b	A.39 utt1	Uh huh.
qw	A.39 utt2	How long have you been doing this?
sd	B.40 utt1	I've been a vegetarian for, two years now.
sd	B.40 utt2	My husband has been one for, just over a year now.
b	A.41 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.43 utt1	Do you feel that it has improved the way you feel?
na	B.44 utt1	Definitely.
bh	A.45 utt1	Do you think?
sv	B.46 utt1	And it makes you more aware of what you're eating.
b	A.47 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.48 utt1	Because you have to be.
b	A.49 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.50 utt1	I mean, you k ,
sv	B.50 utt2	I think you, you balance the foods, you know,
sv	B.50 utt3	you're more aware of what nutrient, you know, value each thing has, and minerals.
b	A.51 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.52 utt2	And you're just more aware of food for energy, for energy sake.
b	A.53 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.55 utt1	I always thought it would be hard to figure what to eat if you were a vegetarian.
sd	B.56 utt1	Well, that's just it,
sv	B.56 utt2	you do have to figure it out. and, you know, get proteins and things.
b	A.57 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.58 utt2	And when I was a vegan, it's, you know,
sv	B.58 utt3	you have to consider calcium and iron and things like that you're not even getting through your milk products,
b	A.59 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.61 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.62 utt1	your egg products. If you don't eat any of those,
^2	A.63 utt1	Because you don't eat any of those things.
sv	B.64 utt2	but actually you can get everything you need through vegetables.
sv	B.64 utt3	I mean, there are, there are,
sv	B.64 utt4	you actually you can get more calcium through leafy green vegetables than you can get through milk products.
bh	A.65 utt1	Is that right?
sv	B.66 utt1	A lot of people don't know that.
b	A.67 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.68 utt1	Well, the thing is that milk products,
sv	B.68 utt2	our bodies don't,
sv	B.68 utt4	that kind of milk, it doesn't,
b	A.69 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.70 utt2	we tend to,
qw	B.70 utt3	what's it called?
sv	B.70 utt4	We don't synthesize the calcium the same way.
sv	A.71 utt1	we throw more of it off our bod , out, in other words.
b	B.74 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.74 utt2	we slough some of it,
sv	B.74 utt3	we send, we send some of it out because our body doesn't accept some of it.
b	A.75 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.76 utt1	So we're,
sv	B.76 utt2	when it gets rid of some of that, that we can't use, it gets rid of some of the calcium.
b	A.77 utt1	Uh huh.
 +	B.78 utt1	Whereas when we eat, say broccoli, you utilize all of it.
b	A.79 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.80 utt2	your body accepts all of the broccoli.
^2	A.81 utt1	All that's in it.
b	A.83 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.84 utt1	So, it's like, it's like, say, a person using vitamins, as opposed to, vitamin supplements as opposed to eating regular food.
qw	A.85 utt1	Why?
b	A.87 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.88 utt1	Your body just doesn't accept vitamins and the minerals in the, the vitamins in, supplements that it does in regular food,
b	A.89 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.91 utt1	Uh huh.
ba	A.93 utt1	That's interesting.
sd	B.94 utt1	But we both feel much healthier, much healthier.
b	A.95 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.96 utt2	And I couldn't consider going back to eating,
^2	A.97 utt1	After you have been on this.
aa	B.98 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.98 utt2	Well, now I changed for ethical reasons.
b	A.99 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.100 utt1	And my husband has changed.
sd	B.100 utt2	He feels more ethically about it.
sd	B.100 utt3	But he in the beginning, began for health reasons.
b	A.101 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.102 utt1	But, now he feels like I do.
sd	B.102 utt2	he looks at the things that he eats
sd	B.102 utt3	and he realizes what they are before he eats them.
 b	A.103 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.104 utt2	And he, you know,
b	A.105 utt1	Uh huh.
bf	A.107 utt1	He thinks more about them, then.
aa	B.108 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.108 utt2	Plus he eats,
 sd	B.108 utt3	I thought more of about it as far as what it was I was eating, you know, as a living creature.
b	A.109 utt1	Uh huh.
 b	A.111 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.112 utt1	And now we both think a lot of well, what is it we're eating in relation to what it's going to give to our bodies.
b	A.113 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.113 utt2	So you kind of have a combination.
b	B.114 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.115 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.115 utt2	Well see, I live in a farming community. So, of course we have a lot of animals and that type of thing raised in our area.
b	B.116 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.118 utt1	Well, we do too.
sd	B.118 utt2	I mean, I was raised in,
sd	B.118 utt3	we're in cattle country.
b	A.119 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.120 utt1	And people here buy a half a cow and put it in their freezer,
 b	A.121 utt1	Uh huh.
 b	A.123 utt1	yeah,
b	A.123 utt2	yeah.
sd	B.124 utt1	you know. And that's the way I,
 %	B.124 utt2	and I,
sd	B.124 utt3	believe you me it wasn't easy to give up , to give up a hamburger.
sd	B.128 utt1	that was one of my favorite foods, was a, was a good steak or a hamburger.
b	A.129 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.130 utt1	But, you know, I suppose if you really believe in something you adjust your life
^2	A.131 utt1	You get adjusted to the taste.
 b	A.133 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.134 utt1	because your mind.
b	A.135 utt1	Uh huh.
 sv	B.136 utt2	inside yourself it's not right.
b	A.137 utt1	Uh huh.
qy^d	A.139 utt1	So you would have a little more trouble when you were looking for a dining area than what most most people would.
ny@	B.140 utt1	yes. Yeah.
sd	A.143 utt1	Now we wouldn't have that problem, because we're not vegetarians.
qw	B.144 utt1	So what do you look for when you,
sd	A.145 utt1	I think the main thing that I look for is, cleanliness, you know, in the appearance of the people that work there.
b	B.146 utt1	Uh huh.
 +	A.147 utt1	And the, quality of the food that they serve.
qr	B.148 utt1	when you're traveling, do you look for places that's established, that you've been to before or are you willing to try new places?
ny	A.149 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.151 utt1	we try new places
sd	A.151 utt3	a lot of times we do eat where we know.
aa	B.152 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.152 utt2	Like a chain restaurant or something.
ny	A.155 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.157 utt1	What the quality,
sv	A.157 utt2	because a lot of them are the same no matter where you stop.
b	B.158 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.159 utt1	And, we do, do that a lot.
sd	A.159 utt2	And I guess I'm getting older,
sd	A.159 utt3	also I like to be served.
sd	A.159 utt4	I like to sit down and have my, order taken.
qy^d	B.160 utt1	As opposed to like a cafeteria kind of situation?
na	A.161 utt1	Right,
ny	A.161 utt2	yeah.
sv	A.163 utt1	So, I suppose you'd say I,
sv	A.163 utt2	well I don't know whether it's age or what it is.
ar	B.164 utt1	Well no,
sd	B.164 utt2	I don't think so.
sd	B.164 utt3	I think it's just your,
sd	B.164 utt4	because I prefer to be waited on too.
sd	B.164 utt5	I just,
qh	B.164 utt6	if you're going to go out to eat, why not have the whole service, you know?
ba	A.165 utt1	Yeah,
b	A.167 utt1	Yeah.
qh	B.168 utt1	Why not get the whole,
sd	B.168 utt2	I guess because we don't go out that much,
b	A.169 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.170 utt1	I feel like it's a treat.
sd	A.171 utt1	You should have a treat.
ba	B.172 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.173 utt1	And I like the light meals.
sd	A.173 utt2	Not all restaurants have light meals on their menu, you know.
b	B.174 utt1	Uh huh.
 %	A.175 utt2	And I,
 b	B.176 utt1	Oh.
 qy	B.176 utt2	Light menu, you mean like cooked light or,
sd	A.177 utt1	L I T E, like, things that aren't as heavy a meal.
bk	B.178 utt1	I see.
b	B.180 utt1	Uh huh.
 sd	A.181 utt1	you get more, fruit and maybe cottage cheese or a chicken breast or things that aren't as,
sd	A.181 utt2	they're not breaded
sd	A.181 utt3	and they're not fried
sd	A.181 utt4	and they're not,
^2	B.182 utt1	Not a lot of gravy and things like that.
aa	A.183 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.185 utt1	but it's not all rest,
sd	B.186 utt1	You know, I, I like those too.
b	A.189 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.190 utt1	I like those too, because, seems like sometimes you order a meal, you order their dinner meal, and it's like they're trying to find out how much you can eat.
 	%        B.190 utt2	Or
 ba	A.191 utt1	I know
 %	B.192 utt1	or ,
 sd	A.193 utt1	it's too much,
aa	A.193 utt2	yes.
 sv	B.194 utt1	or like evidently people go in there and they're not satisfied that they'd been given enough and they complain
sv	B.194 utt2	and maybe they're afraid that people are going to, complain or something.
b	A.195 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.199 utt1	I don't know what it is.
sd	A.199 utt2	But, now for instance, we had a Scout dinner last night we went to.
sd	A.199 utt4	well they'll serve you at your seat
sd	A.199 utt5	and usually the salad bar is included,
sd	A.199 utt6	so you have to get up for that.
sd	A.199 utt7	But they have so much food that not matter how hard you try to restrain yourself, you end up eating much more than you need.
b	B.200 utt1	Uh huh.
 sv	B.200 utt2	And I think that's a shame.
b	A.201 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.202 utt1	I mean, I must admit, sometimes I do like a buffet.
sd	B.202 utt2	but I think that they just tend to make you say, well, I've have got all I can eat
b	A.203 utt1	Uh huh.
 	sd         B.204 utt1	or, you know, it's one of these situations where nobody's going to restrain what you eat,
 	b        A.205 utt1	Uh huh.
 	+        B.206 utt1	the amount that you eat.
b	A.207 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.208 utt1	And I think that we just tend to eat, overeat.
b	A.209 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.209 utt2	You can eat as much as you want and you like the food, you know.
b	B.210 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.212 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.213 utt1	a lot of times the foods,
sv	A.213 utt2	like, Haas's carry a bread bar that is just out of this world .
b	B.214 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.215 utt2	and soup
sd	A.215 utt4	and fruit and vegetables
h	A.215 utt6	I don't know.
sd	A.215 utt9	I know I always overeat no matter.
sd	A.215 utt10	I go with good intentions,
sd	A.217 utt2	somehow along the way, when I come back to my seat, I have too much.
sd	A.217 utt3	And I eat it because it's so good.
b	B.218 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.218 utt2	Well at least it's fruit and stuff there .
b	A.219 utt1	Yeah
sv	B.220 utt1	Maybe it's not too bad.
sd	A.221 utt1	And I like reasonable prices of course, too.
 sd	A.221 utt2	I don't like to, you know, go to anything that's real expensive.
b	B.222 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.223 utt1	I think that's a waste of my money.
^2	B.224 utt1	Just for food, it does seem like it.
 b	A.225 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.227 utt1	Uh huh.
 b	B.228 utt1	Yeah.
 %	B.228 utt2	But,
sd	B.230 utt1	we do like international food,
qy	A.231 utt1	Do you?
sd	B.232 utt2	we like Indian food,
b	A.233 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.234 utt1	and, I love Italian food,
 b	A.235 utt1	Uh huh.
qy^d	A.237 utt1	Chinese?
na	B.238 utt1	Chinese
sd	A.239 utt1	We've got a good Chinese restaurant in town.
b	B.240 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.241 utt1	I really like eating there
 	sd       A.241 utt2	and you don't get stuffed on their food it seems.
b	B.242 utt1	Yeah.
 sd	A.243 utt1	You know, you can eat a whole big plate of their food, and you really don't feel like you've eaten too much.
 sd	A.245 utt1	You're full, you know,
 sd	A.245 utt2	you're satisfied,
b	B.246 utt1	Yeah.
 sd	A.247 utt1	but you don't feel stuffed and miserable.
b	B.248 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.248 utt2	yeah.
sd	B.248 utt3	That's one thing that I wish we had more of,
sd	B.248 utt4	Because where we're from, it's pretty limited,
sd	B.248 utt5	and it's,
sd	B.248 utt6	most of the restaurants they tend to be, you know, American style food.
 	b        A.249 utt1	Uh huh.
 	sd        B.250 utt1	And we don't have too many, w ,
 sd	B.250 utt2	you have to go all the way to Dallas.
 sd	B.252 utt1	And so it really is a treat,
 b	A.253 utt1	yeah.
 %	B.254 utt1	because,
 	b        A.255 utt1	Yeah.
 sd	B.256 utt1	you know, we don't make a you know, sixty five to eighty miles. Depending how far in Dallas it is.
 	b       A.257 utt1	Yeah.
