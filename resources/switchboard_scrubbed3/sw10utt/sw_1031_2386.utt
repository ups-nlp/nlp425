sd	A.1 utt1	Well, Patricia, I was just about to get on my tread mill,
sd^t	A.1 utt2	and then I remembered that I didn't make a call last night,
sd^t	A.1 utt3	and I thought I'd make one tonight.
sd	B.2 utt1	Well, I have an exercise bicycle in my bedroom, but it usually's holding clothes .
sd	A.3 utt1	That's what I did with mine, for a long time, put it on the handlebars so I can hang them up.
b	B.6 utt1	Right .
sd	A.7 utt1	And sometimes she just flops them all over the seat.
sd	B.8 utt1	Well, that's not why I got it,
b	B.8 utt2	right .
qo	B.8 utt3	How do you like your tread mill?
sd	A.9 utt1	I like it.
qy	B.10 utt2	is it less boring than the bicycle or not.
nn	A.11 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.11 utt2	it's just as boring.
qy	B.12 utt1	You watch T V or something while you do it?
na	A.13 utt1	I read a book while I'm doing it.
b	B.14 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.15 utt1	But I was doing that on the exercise bike.
sd	B.16 utt1	Well, I do that too.
sd	A.17 utt1	I feel like I'm getting a little better of a workout, and I'm losing more weight on this than on the other.
b	B.18 utt1	Really.
 bh	B.20 utt1	Are you?
sd	A.21 utt4	I'm going to turn forty this summer,
sd	A.21 utt5	I was getting all dimpled up .
 b	B.22 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.23 utt1	And those are going away.
b	B.24 utt1	Really.
sv	A.25 utt1	So that's real good.
b	B.26 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.27 utt1	We got it at a little bit of an incline.
qy	B.28 utt1	Are they kind of expensive.
na@	A.29 utt1	this one, yeah,
sd	A.29 utt2	this is five hundred.
b	B.30 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.31 utt1	I know they get cheaper.
bh	B.32 utt1	They do?
b	A.33 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.34 utt1	Probably the more you pay, though, the better the machine you have.
sd	A.35 utt1	Well, I hope so.
qy^g	B.36 utt1	Well, you can believe that anyway, right.
ny	A.37 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.37 utt2	I didn't buy it really.
sd	A.37 utt3	My husband bought it because we'd never get out and go walking or anything,
sd	A.37 utt4	and we go to the lake
sd	A.37 utt5	and we ski and swim in the summer
^2	B.38 utt1	During the year.
b	A.39 utt2	uh huh.
b	B.40 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.40 utt2	well, in bad weather, you know, well you'd have to do something inside.
b	A.41 utt1	Yeah.
qy	B.42 utt1	Do you work at T I?
b	A.43 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.43 utt2	I think, your voice sounds familiar.
b	B.44 utt1	Really.
qw	A.45 utt1	Where do you wo ,

sd^t	A.47 utt1	I wonder if we talked before.
qw	B.48 utt1	Where do you live?
sd	A.49 utt1	I'm in Garland.
nn	B.50 utt1	No,
sd^t	A.51 utt1	You sound like this girl that I talked to about books, and we got into movies one night.
b	B.52 utt1	really.
b	A.53 utt1	Uh huh.
ar	B.54 utt1	no,
sd^t	B.54 utt2	this is the first time I've done it.
sd^t	B.54 utt3	my husband was just running out the door,
sd	B.54 utt4	he's working at night tonight.
sd^t	B.54 utt5	So I decided to do it .
sd^t	B.56 utt1	I haven't talked before.
qw^t	B.56 utt2	what subjects have you talked about?
^h	A.57 utt1	Let's see,
sd^t	A.57 utt2	education. Social changes that we've seen in the last ten, twenty, thirty years. Yeah,
bk	B.58 utt1	Oh .
ba	B.60 utt1	Well, that's interesting.
sd^t	A.61 utt2	that one was.
sv	B.62 utt1	It's more interesting than the treadmill and the bicycle.
^g	B.62 utt2	Right?
sv^t	A.63 utt1	The most boring one was about what meal would you cook for a sit down dinner.
ba	B.64 utt1	my goodness .
sd^t	A.65 utt1	The other woman didn't cook too much either.
sv^t	B.66 utt1	really have a lot of variety.
aa^t	A.67 utt1	Yeah,
sd^t	A.67 utt2	they do.
sd^t	A.67 utt3	I talked to this old woman that was a retired administrator in Ohio one night about education.
 ^2	B.70 utt1	A school administrator.
 b	A.71 utt1	Uh huh,
sv	B.72 utt1	Well that could, That would have been interesting.
sd	A.73 utt1	Retired, but.
b	A.75 utt1	Yeah,
sd^t	A.75 utt2	and then no, one night I talked to one guy
 sd^t	A.75 utt3	and then a couple of weeks later I talked to the guy's roommate, in Virginia, about different things.
b	B.76 utt1	Really,
sd^t	B.76 utt2	well that's neat.
b	A.77 utt1	Uh huh.
sd^t	A.77 utt2	One was about painting.
^q^t	A.77 utt3	When was the last time you painted something?
^q^t	A.77 utt4	Did you feel like you did a good job?
^q^t	A.77 utt5	Did you feel, rewarded while you were doing it.
b	A.79 utt1	Uh huh.
qy^t	B.80 utt1	How long is this going to go on, do you know?
no	A.81 utt1	I don't know.
sd^t	B.82 utt1	I don't either .
sv^t	B.84 utt1	It's interesting, though.
sd^t	B.84 utt2	I never heard of such a project before.
b	A.85 utt1	Huh uh.
qw^t	A.85 utt2	Well, how'd you find out about it?
br	B.86 utt1	Pardon me?
qw^t	A.87 utt1	How did you find out about it?
sd	B.88 utt1	I don't know.
sd^t	B.88 utt2	I guess my husband got a letter at the office,
sv^t	B.88 utt3	I presume,
sv^t	B.88 utt4	and they must have been asking.
qy	B.88 utt5	Does your husband work with T I.
nn	A.89 utt1	Uh huh.
bh	B.90 utt1	really.
aa	A.91 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.91 utt2	I have a friend that had a roommate that worked at T I
b	B.92 utt1	Uh huh.
 sd^t	A.93 utt2	and she saw it on the computer screen and they made copies of it.
sd^t	B.96 utt1	so they wanted anybody,
sd^t	B.96 utt2	don't have to work at T I.
b	A.97 utt1	Uh huh.
ba	B.98 utt1	Well, that's interesting.
b	A.99 utt1	Uh huh.
sd^t	B.100 utt1	I had no idea that was just for the employees,
sd^t	B.100 utt2	and I couldn't understand,
sd^t	B.100 utt3	I kept getting these calls,
sd^t	B.100 utt4	I thought it was an advertisement and they just were also called T I, you know,
sd^t	B.100 utt5	there is Texas Industries and different things.
b	A.101 utt1	Uh huh.
sd^t	B.102 utt1	I kept hanging up on them for days, until my husband told me what it was .
b	A.103 utt1	Oh .
sd^t	B.104 utt1	I didn't know.
sd^t	A.105 utt1	Well, if you work for T I you're supposed to get a prize, is what I heard,
sd^t	A.105 utt2	and if you don't work for them you're supposed to get cash.
sd^t	A.107 utt1	But then on the letter it says cash or prize.
b	B.108 utt1	Oh.
sd^t	B.108 utt2	Well the prizes are pretty nice.
sd^t	B.108 utt3	He brought a booklet home
sd^t	B.108 utt4	and depending on how many calls, I think three was the minimum.
sd^t	B.108 utt5	But it went up to, I don't know, nine or ten.
qw^t@	B.108 utt6	How many calls have you had? Well, it sounds like a lot.
h	A.109 utt1	I don't know,
sd^t	A.109 utt2	gobs.
sd^t	A.111 utt1	This is going on my fourth week to do it.
b	B.112 utt1	my.
sd^t	B.112 utt2	And some of the prizes are pretty nice.
qw^d	A.113 utt1	Well, like what,
ad^t	A.113 utt2	tell me.
h^t	B.114 utt1	I wish I had that booklet here.
h^t	B.114 utt2	I think I do,
sd^t	B.114 utt3	it's right here.
qy^g	B.114 utt4	I'll look at the end because those would be the best ones, okay?
ny	A.115 utt1	Yeah.
sd^t	B.116 utt1	well, they have some watches that look really nice.
sd^t	B.116 utt2	There's one that's got some diamonds on it.
qw^d^t	A.117 utt1	For how many calls?
qy^t	A.119 utt1	Does it say?
sd^t	B.120 utt1	I haven't quite figured that out.
sd^t	B.120 utt2	I thought it was eight or nine,
qy^g^t	B.120 utt3	but seems like too nice a prize for just nine calls, isn't it?
b	A.121 utt1	Uh huh.
sd(^q)^t	B.122 utt1	Says when we have enough calls from you, you will receive in the mail a numbered certificate for your calls and explanation how to redeem, for gifts.
qy	B.126 utt2	Are you listening to him?
nn	A.127 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.127 utt2	I'm trying not to.
sd	A.127 utt3	He's telling me to start the grill.
b	B.128 utt1	Oh .
sd^t	B.130 utt1	It says three for a B gift, five for a C gift, et cetera.
sd^t	B.130 utt2	And this only goes up to F.
sd^t	B.130 utt3	So I thought that was somewhere around nine.
sd^t	B.130 utt4	But anyway, it's got these beautiful watches on it.
^h	B.130 utt5	Let me see what else
sd^t	B.130 utt6	it has a, clock radio that also plays you know, tapes.
sd^t	B.130 utt7	Then it's got, some binoculars, and some pretty brass lamps.
sd^t	B.130 utt8	Got a food processor.

sd^t	B.132 utt5	It has a button you can push,
sd^t	B.132 utt6	if you get a call you don't like then it makes machine gun noise .
sd^t	B.134 utt1	And then there's an attache case, and cordless telephone,

sd^t	B.140 utt4	here's a calculator but it's not even made by T I,
qh	B.140 utt5	isn't that funny.
qr^t	A.141 utt1	Did they mail that to you, or he brought it to you?
 sd^t	B.142 utt1	He brought it home.
sd^t	B.144 utt1	I believe it came in his mail.

qy^t	A.151 utt1	Well, do you know you have a ten minute time limit.
nn	B.152 utt1	no.
bk	A.153 utt1	Well that's okay,
sd^t	A.153 utt2	and then they come on and they tell you got five seconds to say good bye.
 sd^t	B.154 utt1	well, it's been fun,
sd^t	B.154 utt2	this is my first time to do it.
sd^t	A.155 utt1	We'll keep talking if we want to come up with something else.
b	B.156 utt1	Yeah.
^h	A.157 utt1	Let's see,
sd	A.157 utt2	I tried exercise classes,
sd	A.157 utt3	and I never would go.
sd	A.157 utt5	we joined, ex.
sd	B.158 utt1	I went to Metropolitan a couple of years ago,
sd	B.158 utt2	so I sit and study,
sd	B.158 utt3	I sit in class,
sd	B.158 utt4	and I have really ballooned up since then,
sd	B.158 utt5	and, so, he's says I ought to join one of those that makes you go,
sv	A.159 utt1	They don't either,
sd	A.161 utt1	Well the first one I joined, they went out of business
sd	A.161 utt2	and they transferred it to another one that was really far away.
sv	B.162 utt1	That's a very common experience.
sd	A.163 utt1	And we were going to do it,
 sd	A.163 utt2	there was four of us together.
sd	A.165 utt1	Well, then forget that,
sd	A.165 utt2	it wasn't near me.
b	B.166 utt1	No.
sd	A.167 utt1	And then the second time I was going to do it at Richland College,
sd	A.167 utt3	I just get with another friend,
sd	A.167 utt4	and we'd end up just smoking cigarettes and riding around like we couldn't find the place .
ba	B.168 utt1	That's funny .
sd	A.169 utt1	So my husband's just discouraged me on those things.
b	B.170 utt1	Right,
sv	B.170 utt2	well, if you can make yourself do the tread mill, I mean, gosh, that's a good workout.
b	A.171 utt1	yeah,
sd	A.171 utt2	my husband said he's never joined a course, right.
sd	A.171 utt3	And I got one of those Jane Fonda workout tapes that I dubbed from a friend.
b	B.172 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.173 utt1	That didn't last long
sd	A.173 utt2	I had a baby, I think .

sd	B.212 utt3	None of my friends have failed the English or the education ones .
