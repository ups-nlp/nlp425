 o	A.1 utt1	Okay
 sd	A.1 utt2	wow, I don't know what that was.
qw	B.2 utt1	What was that?
sd	A.3 utt1	I don't know .
sd	B.4 utt1	And, to, the Brazos River near Dinosaur Valley State Park.
b	A.5 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.7 utt1	yes.
b	B.8 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.9 utt1	Uh huh,
sd	A.9 utt2	we have not camped in any of those places,
sd	A.9 utt3	in fact it has been a number of years since we have camped,
sd	A.9 utt4	but we used to go to Tyler State Park and, Daingerfield
sd	A.9 utt5	and in Texas that is where we camp basically.
qo	B.10 utt1	What are they like?
sd	A.11 utt1	They are very nice.
sd	A.11 utt2	Tyler is really, really a neat place to camp.
sd	A.11 utt3	It has a nice little lake
sd	A.11 utt4	and it has some really wonderful, sights that are in the wooded areas.
sd	A.11 utt5	the facilities are quite nice
sd	A.11 utt6	and our children liked it quite well.
sd@	A.11 utt7	well they are quite a bit younger than, / * should be 'then'
sd	A.11 utt9	we felt real safe with their being able to do what they would like to do there in the area.
sd	A.11 utt10	And, it was just a really nice place to camp.
b	B.12 utt1	Uh huh.
^h	A.13 utt2	let's see,
sv	A.13 utt3	I think that's a little bit more east, further east, and maybe south, if I am remembering where that is.
ar	A.13 utt4	No,
sv	A.13 utt5	I think it's a little bit further north, when I think about it.
sd	A.13 utt6	At any rate it was very nice as well.
sd	A.13 utt7	But Tyler, we sort of got spoiled with, I think.
 b	B.14 utt1	Uh huh.
 sd	A.15 utt1	But, we had lived in Michigan before we came here and, had done a lot of camping in Michigan,
sd	A.15 utt2	I think the upper peninsula of Michigan, especially,
sd	A.15 utt3	and then also, we had done some camping in Colorado, in the mountains,
sd	A.15 utt4	so, my parents were real avid campers
sd	A.15 utt5	and my husband's parents were really avid campers as well.
sd	A.15 utt6	So I guess we just kind of came by it naturally .
b	B.16 utt1	Yeah.
qy	A.17 utt1	Do you have a large tent
ny	B.18 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.18 utt2	it was a nine by twelve.
b	A.19 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.20 utt1	Uh huh.
qw	A.21 utt1	And how many does it sleep, comfortably?
sv	B.22 utt1	Well, there, well supposedly,
sv	B.22 utt2	they always say it sleeps more than it does.
b	A.23 utt1	Right .
sd	B.24 utt2	it would have slept three adults anyway.
b	A.25 utt1	Yeah,
b	B.26 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.27 utt1	Well, sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger, we invested in some stacking, cots, you know, that were like bunk beds,
sd	A.27 utt2	but they were fold up cots.
sd	A.27 utt3	That really gave us a lot more floor space and, so, you did not have to be constantly getting things off the floor in order to walk around
b	B.28 utt1	Right.
sd	A.29 utt1	gave us a place to stack things during the day
sd	A.29 utt2	so that was real nice.
sd	A.29 utt4	like, my in laws also had a camper, or, a pop up tent, you know, one of those trailer tops
sd	A.29 utt5	and those are really nice too.
sd	A.29 utt6	A little more, luxurious, so to speak, but not much .
qy	B.30 utt1	do they have a kitchen in them?
ny	A.31 utt1	Yes,
ny	A.31 utt2	uh huh.
sd	A.31 utt3	It's really nice,
sd	A.31 utt4	in fact, it even had a little refrigerator, and the whole business.
sd	A.31 utt5	It was quite nice in that respect.
sd	A.31 utt6	and everything was very convenient
sd	A.31 utt7	and you did not have to be hauling things out of the trunk of you car,
^2	B.32 utt1	Trunk of your car all time, right.
sd	A.33 utt1	and that was nice.
qy	A.33 utt2	So, do you have plans for any other camping trips in the near future?
na	B.34 utt1	maybe back to Caddo, or, Purdis Creek.
b	A.35 utt1	Uh huh.
 b	A.37 utt1	Right.
 sd	B.38 utt1	Or, I like Bob Sandlin too,
sd	B.38 utt2	it's a new park.
 b	A.39 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.40 utt1	And there is, not really camping,
sd	B.40 utt3	what is it called, Cedar Hill.
b	A.41 utt1	Right.
sd	B.42 utt1	Lake Joe Pool.
 b	A.43 utt1	yes.
sd	B.44 utt1	And sometime, I like to go to Eisenhower up on Lake Texoma.
aa	A.45 utt1	Yes,
aa^r	A.45 utt2	yes,
sd	A.45 utt3	I have been in that area.
sv	A.45 utt4	That is a really pretty state park.
sd	A.45 utt6	we did not camp there,
sd	A.45 utt7	but we drove through it just one time when we were in that area
sv	A.45 utt8	and it's real lovely.
sd	A.45 utt9	It's close to the lake and close to,
sd	A.45 utt10	I think it's close to the dam up there
sv	A.45 utt11	so it's really quite pretty.
qy	A.45 utt12	are you,
^h	A.45 utt13	let's see what was,
^h	A.45 utt14	I was going to ask you something else.
qy	A.45 utt15	do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to?
^h	B.46 utt1	from those three,
na	B.46 utt2	just, from when I have been an adult, I like Caddo the best.
b	A.47 utt1	Yeah,
b	A.47 utt2	uh huh.
qy	A.47 utt3	is it true that Caddo Lake is the only natural lake in the State of Texas?
ny	B.48 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.48 utt2	that's right.
 %	A.49 utt1	I would,
sd	A.49 utt2	I have never been there
sd	A.49 utt3	and I would love to see what it looks like .
sd	B.50 utt1	it's not very deep.
b	A.51 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.52 utt1	And they did build a dam on it,
sd	B.52 utt2	but it was there before they built the dam.
sd	B.52 utt3	It has been there for a hundred years.
b	A.53 utt1	I see.
sv	B.54 utt1	Apparently, an earth quake caused it.
ba	A.55 utt1	How interesting.
b	B.56 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.57 utt1	I guess I never heard the history of that.
sd	A.57 utt2	well, that might be some place where my husband and I can go.
sd	A.57 utt3	We are talking about starting camping again in the fall.
sd	A.57 utt4	our children are both grown
sd	A.57 utt5	and so, it's just pretty much the two of us who do things.
sd	A.57 utt6	And so, we thought we might take some weekend trips and maybe that would be a good place to go to and see what it looks like.
b	B.58 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.58 utt2	it's really nice.
b	A.59 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.59 utt2	yeah.
h	B.60 utt1	And I don't know,
sv	B.60 utt2	spring is probably the busiest time anywhere in Texas.
bh	A.61 utt1	Is it?
aa	A.61 utt2	yeah,
sv	A.61 utt3	I think so.
sv	A.61 utt5	when the trees start blossoming out and everything it is really very pretty,
 b	B.62 utt1	Right.
 sv	A.63 utt1	especially in East Texas, it's really nice.
fc	A.63 utt2	So, well, I have enjoyed talking with you.
fc	B.64 utt1	It was nice talking to you.
fc	A.65 utt1	And, have, some happy camping trips .
fc	A.67 utt1	Hope you get to those places you have talked about.
fc	B.68 utt1	Yeah,
 fc	B.68 utt2	you too.
fc	A.69 utt1	Well, okay,
fc	A.69 utt2	thanks.
fc	B.70 utt1	Bye,
