sd	A.1 utt1	Well, I am new to Texas,
sd	A.1 utt2	so I don't even know what the law is, in the state,
bh	B.2 utt1	Uh huh?
bh	A.3 utt2	do you?
 ny	B.4 utt1	Well, yes,
sd	B.4 utt2	of course, we do have capital punishment.
sd	B.4 utt3	And we've, you know, done away with our, quote, fair share number.
ba	A.5 utt1	that's right,
sd	A.5 utt2	I think now, that I recall, reading about it in the paper.
b	B.6 utt1	Yes.
qy	A.7 utt2	is it restricted to certain crimes?
 ny	B.8 utt1	Yes,
sd^e	B.8 utt2	it's certain crimes, capital crimes, murder, of course, rape, this sort of thing.
b	A.9 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.12 utt1	It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks, you know, that get into the system.
b	A.13 utt1	Yes,
sv	A.13 utt2	I know,
sv	A.13 utt3	the one thing that I think is really sad about it, as I recall, from the articles that I've read, is that if people who have been there, are going to be killed. there's people that come to the prisons and they're very violent
sv	A.13 utt5	I mean they're anxious for someone to be killed .
b	B.14 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.14 utt2	Yes.
 %	A.15 utt1	I just,
sd	A.15 utt2	I can't see that.
sv	B.16 utt1	That happens on occasion,
sv	B.16 utt2	it sure does,
sv	B.18 utt1	maybe it just depends on, you know, how closely the crime, you know, has affected you personally.
b	A.19 utt1	Uh huh.
h	B.20 utt2	You know, I don't know,
sv	B.20 utt3	or a person personally.
ar	A.21 utt1	No.
sv	B.22 utt1	I think I would be, you know,
sd	B.22 utt2	really if I had to say yes or no, I guess I would say, you know, that I am in certain cases, in favor of the death penalty,
sv	B.22 utt3	I don't know that it's a big deterrent really.
sv	B.22 utt4	I don't know that it is.
sv	B.22 utt5	I don't know how we'd ever find out, you know, really whether it is or not.
sv	A.23 utt1	Well, there is so many chances for appeal, that it kee ,
aa	B.24 utt1	yeah,
aa	B.24 utt2	absolutely,
aa^r	B.24 utt3	yeah,
sv	B.24 utt4	it goes on for years and years, and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, taxpayer money.
sv	A.25 utt2	it's really sad.
b	B.26 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.27 utt1	I don't know,
sv	A.27 utt2	I just think,
sd	A.27 utt3	somehow I hoped that as a people we could be better than, expecting, the feeling that it
b	B.28 utt1	Yes.
sv	A.29 utt3	someone is calling for someone else to be killed, you know.
b@	B.30 utt1	Yes, uh huh.
sv	A.31 utt1	Is really kind of bad .
aa	B.32 utt1	Yes
sv	B.32 utt2	it is.
sv	B.32 utt3	It's a tough, tough question.
sv	B.32 utt4	It really is.
sv	B.34 utt1	I suspect I would be, you know, a lot more favor of it if, you know, one of my children were, you know, brutally killed, or something like that.
sv	B.34 utt2	Like I say, I think it depends on how personally affected, you know, you might be by it.
sv	A.35 utt2	and there really are criminals that are hard core and, repeat, and never have any chance for,
aa	B.36 utt1	absolutely.
ba	B.38 utt1	that's right.
h	A.39 utt1	I don't know,
qy	A.39 utt3	do you feel at all like, it's a religious issue?
ng	B.40 utt1	Not with me personally.
sv	B.40 utt2	It is with a lot of other people.
b	A.41 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.42 utt1	It's not to me personally,
ny	B.42 utt2	no.
ny^r	B.44 utt1	No.
h	A.45 utt1	I don't know,
sd	A.45 utt3	I mean I do go to church and things.
sd	A.45 utt4	I don't know how I would feel about it.
sv	A.45 utt5	But like you say, if it hit you personally, closer at home you would feel, feel differently.
b	B.46 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.48 utt1	Yes.
sv	B.50 utt1	it's a tough, tough question,
sv	B.50 utt2	it really is.
qy	A.51 utt1	Do you think most states have that
ny	B.52 utt1	Yes,
sd^e	B.52 utt2	I think most states do have capital punishment.
ny^r	B.52 utt3	Yes.
b@	A.53 utt1	Uh huh,
sv	B.54 utt1	But, I think the U S is one of the few countries that still do.
bf	A.55 utt1	That still does it,
ba	A.55 utt2	that's right.
aa	B.56 utt1	Yes,
sd	B.56 utt3	I was reading something about it the other day,
sv	B.56 utt4	I think there was only like six or eight countries in the world, that have capital punishment still.
b	A.57 utt1	Uh huh.
 sv	B.58 utt1	A lot of them had to have elected not to do so.
sd	B.58 utt2	Now I don't know, what they do in place of it.
sv	B.58 utt3	You know, maybe it's life in prisonment or, you know, something,
sd	B.58 utt4	I don't know how they handle it
sd	B.58 utt5	bu , I was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment.
bf	A.59 utt1	Have that.
sv	A.59 utt2	Well, and it doesn't seem like very many people, are really, I mean,
sv	A.59 utt3	there's a lot of people that are on death row. But there's not very many people that actually, do get killed.
b	B.60 utt1	yes.
aa	B.62 utt1	Yes,
sv	B.62 utt2	a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else.
b	A.63 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.63 utt2	So, it seems like a of people live there,
sv	A.63 utt3	and then through appeals.
b	B.64 utt1	Yes.
sv	A.65 utt1	Because I know they do frequently,
sd	A.65 utt2	I mean they cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper.
b	B.66 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.66 utt2	Yes.
sd	A.67 utt1	If it finally gets to that point.
b	B.68 utt1	Right,
sv	B.68 utt2	the first appeal is automatic,
sv	B.68 utt3	so that delays it for a few years just right off the bat.
b	A.69 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.70 utt1	there's a lot of, you know, last minute, things that happen cause a person not to, have to go through the whole thing.
b	A.71 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.73 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.73 utt3	are we doing lethal injection now?
ny	B.74 utt1	Yes,
ny	B.74 utt2	uh huh.
sd^e	B.74 utt3	that's fairly recent, I don't know, how recent, but fairly recent, in the state of Texas.
 sd	B.74 utt4	Before that, it was, death by electrocution.
b	A.75 utt1	Uh huh,
sv	A.75 utt2	which seems so awful.
aa	B.76 utt1	Yes,
sd	B.76 utt2	it certainly does.
sv	A.77 utt1	So, it's a little bit more humane,
sv	A.77 utt2	I guess, it is,
aa	B.78 utt1	Yes,
sv	B.78 utt2	it would almost have to be, I suppose.
sv	B.78 utt3	if you had to chose, I am sure I would take the lethal injection.
aa	A.79 utt1	Yes,
sv	A.79 utt2	the other one just seems so terrible.
aa	B.80 utt1	Yes,
aa	B.80 utt2	absolutely.
sv	B.82 utt1	it's a tough question.
sv	B.82 utt2	It really is.
sd	B.82 utt3	I guess, if I had to say yes or no, I would say, you know, yes.
sd	B.82 utt4	I would have to lean toward capital punishment, you know, for certain crimes.
qy	A.83 utt1	Well, do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime
qrr	A.83 utt2	or, it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison?
nn	B.84 utt1	No,
sv^e	B.84 utt2	I don't think it's a monetary thing.
b	A.85 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.86 utt2	we hope that it will be, you know, some sort of deterrent or, you know, an eye for an eye type thing, or something like that.
sv	B.88 utt1	Some of the crimes are just so brutal and so, you know, useless.
sv	B.88 utt2	This may seem to be the best way out.
h	B.88 utt3	I don't know.
b	A.89 utt1	Yes.
bf	B.90 utt1	Easiest way out maybe.
nn^r	B.90 utt2	No,
sv^e^r	B.90 utt3	I don't think it's a monetary thing.
sd	A.91 utt1	Well, and I notice that the crime rate was up in the Dallas area .
sv	A.91 utt2	It's, It's kind of been scary, to think about it
b	B.92 utt1	Yes,
sd	B.92 utt2	especially the murder rate, its just gone crazy.
b	B.94 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.95 utt2	and, And you're hoping there is something that will cut down on that.
aa	B.96 utt1	Absolutely.
aa	B.98 utt1	Yes,
sd	B.98 utt2	I wish I had the answer for that,
sv	B.98 utt3	everybody does.
sv	A.99 utt1	You hate to have the dubious honor of being, you know, so high in the, in statistics,
aa	B.100 utt1	Yes,
sv	B.100 utt2	it's nothing to be proud of,
sv	B.102 utt1	certainly not.
sd	A.103 utt2	we have been really fortunate
sd	A.103 utt3	our family, hasn't had any crime.
b	B.104 utt1	Yes.
b	B.106 utt1	Yes,
sd	B.106 utt2	so have we been very, very fortunate.
sv	A.107 utt2	it's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way.
ba	B.108 utt1	That's right.
aa	B.108 utt2	Absolutely.
sv	A.109 utt1	And how they would expect, how they would hope,
b	B.110 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.111 utt2	I mean you hear of people who have, committed crimes, and then they get out of jail and they go, and they do the same thing again.
b	B.112 utt1	Absolutely.
sv	A.113 utt1	And you wonder why they can't just stop it.
b	B.114 utt1	Uh huh.
ba	B.114 utt2	That's right.
sv	A.115 utt1	So, maybe you would,
 b	B.116 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.117 utt1	but still I would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone.
aa	B.118 utt1	So would I,
sd	B.118 utt2	fortunately, I have never been in that circumstance,
 sd	B.118 utt3	I hope I never am, like everybody else.
aa	A.119 utt1	No,
sd	A.119 utt3	we moved here, I got a jury summons,
b	B.120 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.121 utt1	just like constantly, it seemed like,
b	B.122 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.123 utt1	but fortunately I had small children
sd	A.123 utt2	and I didn't have to go.
b	B.124 utt1	Right.
sv	A.125 utt1	And it's not that,
sv	A.125 utt2	I mean, I think everyone should have to serve on the jury,
b	B.126 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.127 utt1	it's just that, I didn't,
sd	A.127 utt2	I hate having to be in charge of someone else's life.
aa	B.128 utt1	Sure,
sv	B.128 utt2	it's a big responsibility,
sv	B.128 utt3	it really is.
sd	A.129 utt1	And I would hate to have to hear any kind of case, involving a violent crime or anything.
b	B.130 utt1	Yes.
sd	B.132 utt1	So would I.
ba	A.133 utt1	That would be really awful.
aa	B.134 utt1	Yes.
aa	B.134 utt2	Absolutely.
sd	A.135 utt1	Well, anyway, I sure have enjoyed, talking to you about this. Although it has been difficult
sv	B.136 utt1	it's a tough subject,
sv	B.136 utt2	it really is.
sv	A.137 utt1	I'd hate to decide it, but I guess it's important, that we decide as a people what we're going to do.
b	B.138 utt1	Right.
ba	B.140 utt1	That's right.
fc	A.141 utt1	Anyway, well, you have a good day.
fc	B.142 utt1	Well, thank you,
fc	B.142 utt2	it's nice talking to you.
fc	A.143 utt1	Thank you,
fc	A.143 utt2	bye bye.
fc	B.144 utt1	Uh huh.
fc	B.144 utt2	Bye bye.
