o	A.1 utt1	Okay,
qy	A.1 utt3	do you have an opinion on that, on the U S R?
sd	B.2 utt2	I think I'm skeptical about the whole thing. and still a little bit worried about them because of the history of Russia.
b	A.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.4 utt1	And they're in a state of flux right now e , changing a great deal primarily because of the economic distress.
b	A.5 utt1	Sure.
b	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.7 utt2	Sure.
sv	B.8 utt1	And even in that situation, it seems like to me from what I've read in the history of Russia and you know different authors, there has always been a paranoia .
sv	B.8 utt2	They've always suspected everybody
sv	B.8 utt3	and and you know, that's why they put a lot of people in prison for years and years,
b	A.9 utt1	Sure.
sv	B.10 utt2	and that's why they put a lot of people to death.
b	A.11 utt1	Sure,
b	A.11 utt2	that happens.
b	B.12 utt1	Yes,
sv	B.12 utt2	but Stalin was a classical example I guess of that paranoia because he he probably killed more Russians than, you know, the Russian army killed anybody else.
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.15 utt1	Sure.
sv	A.15 utt2	I guess in particular my viewpoint is that they financially cannot go into a war.
sv	A.15 utt3	they are desperate at this point in time to keep their country together,
sv	A.15 utt4	but I could not foresee them severing what they have with the U S. because they need us at this current time because of their financial situation.
sv	A.15 utt5	from what I've been hearing is the U S, S R has been, almost bankrupt for years
b	B.16 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.17 utt1	and it's people are desperate,
sv	A.17 utt2	and there might be a revolution within the people.
sv	A.17 utt3	But I don't think the U S would get involved with it because, there's too close of ties to where I think they understand that Gorbachev is trying to make a change, and that we cannot run them like we run the U S and that they have to make their own independent decision.
b	B.18 utt1	Sure.
sd	A.19 utt2	So, I guess I really have no fear at all of the U S S R verses,
sd	A.19 utt3	you get these small little, places like Iraq and all of that, that might be something that I'd be more concerned about with nuclear weapons verses, or as big country of U S S R.
sv	A.19 utt4	I, I have no feelings that they would ever start a war with us because to them you know, it would totally destroy their whole country because our technology is far advanced from what theirs is at this current time.
b	B.20 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.21 utt2	they have weapons to kill us over and over and over,
sd	A.21 utt3	but to them that would be a suicide
sv	A.21 utt5	and the Russian people are not suicidal type of people.
sv	A.21 utt6	But if you get the Iraqis and Iran which will do it for the country for the pleasure of, you know, doing whatever, for their country, they'll do it.
b	B.22 utt1	Yeah,
ba	B.22 utt2	I think you're right.
sv	B.24 utt1	There's a little more craziness down there .
sv	B.24 utt2	the Russian people I think are not that much different from us.
b	A.25 utt1	Sure.
sd	B.26 utt2	You know I think that it would be the leadership that I, mistrust.
b@	A.27 utt1	Sure.
+@	@A.29 utt1	Uh huh,
b	@A.29 utt2	sure.
sd	@A.29 utt3	I have a daughter that's frustrated.
sd	@A.29 utt4	She's on a stool that she can get up on
b	B.30 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.31 utt2	if she can't get down on it it's like, get me down right now .
fc	A.33 utt1	But anyway it was really good talking to you,
fc	A.33 utt2	and you have a good weekend.
fc	B.34 utt1	You too.
fc	B.34 utt2	Thank you.
fc	A.35 utt1	Uh huh.
fc	A.35 utt2	Thank you.
fc	A.35 utt3	Bye now.
fc	B.36 utt1	Bye bye.
