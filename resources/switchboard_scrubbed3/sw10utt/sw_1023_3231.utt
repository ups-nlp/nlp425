qy	A.1 utt1	Do you or your husband work for T I,

qy	B.6 utt1	and, do you work for T I?
ny	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
bk	B.8 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.9 utt1	So, I've worked for them for several years, like twelve now, I guess.
sd	B.10 utt1	you sound very young like just out of college .
b	A.11 utt1	Right,
sd	A.11 utt2	I try to,
sd	A.13 utt1	I try to think of myself as young,
sd	A.13 utt2	but, well, have you seen any movies recently?
^h	B.14 utt1	I'm trying to think,
sd	B.14 utt2	we saw, DANCES WITH WOLVES
bh	A.15 utt1	did you?
qy	B.16 utt1	and, have you seen that one?
nn	A.17 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.17 utt2	I haven't,
sd	A.17 utt3	I have a hard time with movies that are real long.
sv	B.18 utt1	That was excellent.
sd	B.20 utt1	Well, so oddly enough, I do too,
sd	B.20 utt2	I get tired of sitting there, and so does my husband,
b	A.21 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.22 utt2	but we both just thoroughly, you know enjoyed it, just really liked it
b	A.23 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.25 utt1	Well, I've heard a lot of good things about it.
^h	B.26 utt1	and, I'm trying to think,
sd	B.26 utt2	we went to see a real funny one,
sd	B.26 utt3	I can't think now what the name of it was
o@	A.27 utt1	Was it, my wife and I went and saw a couple of funny ones.
sd	B.28 utt1	I've gone blank.
sd	A.29 utt2	We saw THE NAKED GUN, TWO AND A HALF
sd	B.30 utt1	we have not seen that,
sd	B.30 utt2	we want to see that one.
sv	A.31 utt1	and that was pretty funny,
sd	A.31 utt2	and then we saw,
o	A.31 utt3	what was the spoof on TOP GUN,
sd	B.32 utt1	I haven't seen that one.
sd	A.33 utt1	I can't think of what that was called.
sd	A.33 utt2	We saw that too,
sd	A.33 utt4	I was pretty disappointed in that one.
 bh	B.34 utt1	Were you.
aa	A.35 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.35 utt3	we have small children, so we don't get to see too many, but we've seen I guess two or three movies this past summer.
sd	B.36 utt1	My husband doesn't enjoy the shows as much going to them,
sd	B.36 utt2	likes to rent them
b	A.37 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.38 utt1	and so we watch a lot of them, you know, at home as they come out,
b	A.39 utt1	Right.
qy	A.41 utt1	Have you seen GHOSTS yet?
ny	B.42 utt1	Yes,
ny^r	B.42 utt2	yes.
sd	A.43 utt1	I enjoyed that movie,
bh	B.44 utt1	Did you?
sd	B.44 utt2	Now I was real disappointed
b	A.45 utt1	Really.
sd	B.46 utt1	I'm a real big Patrick Swayze fan
b	A.47 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.48 utt1	and, I was really disappointed in it,
sv	B.48 utt4	I don't think it was as funny as what I was anticipating,
sd	B.48 utt5	and I guess I was expecting it to be kind of funny and it wasn't you know, at all,
b	A.49 utt1	yeah,
b	A.51 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.52 utt2	it was more of a love story
b	A.53 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.54 utt1	and, so I was really disappointed in that because I like him real well.
b	A.55 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.56 utt2	We just got through watching one with, is it Claude Van Damme yeah, and, enjoyed it,
^2	A.57 utt1	Van Damme,
aa	A.57 utt2	yeah,
sd	A.57 utt3	I think,
sd	B.58 utt2	I can't think what the name of
sv	B.58 utt3	it was of course, one of the typical you know, kicking, fighting lots of blood and guts and all that type movie,
b	A.59 utt1	Right.
b	A.61 utt1	Right.
b	A.63 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.64 utt2	and we enjoyed that,
qy	B.64 utt3	and, the one with Jody Foster, did you see it?
qy	A.65 utt1	SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?
ny	B.66 utt1	Yes.
ny	A.67 utt1	Yes,
sd^e	A.67 utt2	I did.
qy	B.68 utt1	Wasn't that excellent?
ny	A.69 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.69 utt2	I really enjoyed that a lot.
b	B.70 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.70 utt2	that was one that stayed with me you know, for a month,
b	A.71 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.72 utt3	I kept thinking about it, you know,
b	A.73 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.73 utt2	well, it's amazing,
sv	A.73 utt3	but really, I mean, when you stop and think about it, Anthony Perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie
aa	B.74 utt1	No.
sv	A.75 utt1	and yet it was his character that was so intriguing,
sv	B.76 utt1	it was excellent,
sv	B.76 utt2	and, of course, he's such a, very good actor anyway
b	A.77 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.78 utt1	and, I think he made the movie,
aa	A.79 utt1	Yeah,
aa	A.79 utt2	I do too,
sd	A.79 utt3	I really did
b	B.80 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.81 utt1	you know, Jody Foster was good, too, but I think Anthony Perkins was the one that really made the movie,
aa	A.81 utt2	I agree with you.
qr	B.82 utt1	Is it Anthony Perkins or Anthony Hopkins?
sd	A.83 utt1	Hopkins,
fa	A.83 utt2	I'm sorry
b^m	B.84 utt1	Hopkins,
b	B.84 utt2	uh huh.
b^r	A.85 utt1	Hopkins,
b	A.85 utt2	yeah.
sd	A.85 utt3	I always get those mixed up.
b	B.86 utt1	I know
b	B.88 utt1	I know.
sd	B.88 utt3	I'm not a real big Jody Foster fan,
sd	B.88 utt4	but I thought she was good in that.
sd	A.89 utt3	I saw her in THE KEYS,
sd	A.89 utt4	and I thought that was a pretty good movie,
sv	A.89 utt5	but I thought she,
sv	A.91 utt1	that was pretty interesting movie,
sd	A.91 utt3	I really liked the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS,
sv	A.91 utt4	that was really intriguing,
sd	A.91 utt5	and it didn't scare me all that much, you know,
sd	A.91 utt6	and I don't like to go to movies to be scared,
sd	A.91 utt7	that's not why I go
aa	B.92 utt1	No,
aa^r	B.92 utt2	no
sd	B.94 utt1	I like a good suspenseful story,
b	A.95 utt1	Right,
sv	A.95 utt2	and that one was.
sv	B.96 utt2	and that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats,
sd	B.96 utt3	in fact, I want to, rent it when it comes out for my husband to see,
qy	A.97 utt1	he didn't see it?
ng	B.98 utt1	he won't go see that,
nn	B.98 utt2	no,
bk	A.99 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.100 utt1	I went with, our daughter so, you know, saw it with her, and, enjoyed it.
b	A.101 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.102 utt2	My all time favorite is WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S.
bh	A.103 utt1	really?
qy	B.104 utt1	Did you see it?

sd	B.106 utt3	and then we've rented it several times
b	A.107 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.108 utt1	and, we just love it,
sd	B.108 utt2	in fact we have a ten year old grandson
sd	B.108 utt3	he and my husband and I, we just sit there and cackle you know, just get hysterical.
b	A.109 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.109 utt2	Yeah,
sd	A.109 utt3	I've seen that.
sv	A.111 utt1	it's pretty cute.

sd	A.113 utt1	I love that movie,
sd	B.114 utt1	My husband liked that

sd	B.116 utt1	he's a big Gene Wilder fan,
b	A.117 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.117 utt2	well, Gene Wilder doesn't do that much for me,
sd	A.117 utt3	but I'm a big, Mel Brooks fan
b	B.118 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	B.118 utt2	uh huh.
sd	B.120 utt1	He has a new one out.
qy	A.121 utt1	He does?
ny	B.122 utt1	Yeah,
ny	B.122 utt2	uh huh.
sd	B.122 utt3	I have seen it advertised.

ny	B.124 utt1	Uh huh,
ny^r	B.124 utt2	uh huh.

qy	B.134 utt1	Did you?
ny	A.135 utt1	Yeah,
sv^e	A.135 utt2	that you know, had all kinds of things throughout the whole movie,
sd	A.137 utt1	I just really enjoyed it,
^h	A.137 utt2	and, I'm trying to think,
sd	A.137 utt3	because we saw another one that we thought was really good, early this summer, that was a suspenseful movie.
^h	A.137 utt4	I'm trying to remember what it was,
