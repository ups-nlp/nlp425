qy	A.1 utt1	So have you done any painting projects lately?
ny	B.2 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.2 utt2	this is a great topic for me, because I just did my first two painting projects ever.
bh	A.5 utt1	really?
sd	B.6 utt1	Was not a big deal
qw	A.7 utt1	What kind of painting was it?
sd	B.8 utt1	two little deals,
sd	B.10 utt1	The first one,
sd	B.10 utt2	I helped someone repaint an apartment,
sd	B.10 utt3	and it was very easy.
b	A.11 utt1	Uh huh,
bh	A.11 utt2	was it?
ny	B.12 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.12 utt2	and I've never painted anyth ,
sd	B.12 utt3	I always thought it would be,
sd	B.12 utt4	so, you know, you'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something
b	A.13 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.14 utt1	but I know I can do it.
b	A.15 utt1	uh huh.
sd	B.16 utt1	And the second one was I bought some toys at a craft fair.
b	A.17 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.18 utt1	They're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a little girl for Christmas,
sd	B.18 utt2	and so I decided to paint them,
sd	B.18 utt3	and that wasn't as easy as painting the apartment .
qw	A.19 utt1	well, what kind of paint did you use for the, bookends?
sd	B.20 utt1	Well, it, that's half the problem right there is that it was a oil base,
sd	B.20 utt2	so I had to get,
sd	B.20 utt3	and when I painted them, I didn't realize that we didn't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house.
sd	B.20 utt4	So I had it all over my hands.
sd	B.20 utt5	At first I didn't realize, you know,
sd	B.20 utt6	I had never painted anything,
sd	B.20 utt7	so I didn't realize that I needed that.
b	A.21 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.22 utt2	I mean, I kind of knew, in the back of my mind,
qy^d	A.23 utt1	So you can't use oil on wood?
nn	B.24 utt1	Well, no,
sd^e	B.24 utt2	you can use it on wood,
sd^r	B.24 utt3	but I just had it all over my hands,
sd	B.24 utt4	and I went to wash the brushes out, and, wash my hands,
sd	B.24 utt5	and you can't wash it off with water.
sd	B.24 utt6	You have to get a solution
bf	A.25 utt1	so you had to go around with paint all over you, temporarily, anyway.
aa	B.26 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.26 utt2	I had to drive to the store
aa	B.28 utt1	yeah,
sd	B.28 utt2	I had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy some paint thinner, and everything like that,
sd	B.30 utt2	and then, downstairs in the apartment, we just used a latex base,
sd	B.30 utt3	and so you can drip it on, you know
sd	B.30 utt4	if you dripped it on something, as long as you wiped it up, it was real easy to clean.
qy	A.31 utt1	is that what you usually use in the house, is latex?
ny	B.32 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.32 utt2	and it just like
sd	B.34 utt2	the same with the toys,
sv	B.34 utt3	it's just important to look for one that doesn't have lead in it, you know,
sd(^q)	B.34 utt4	it says Safe for Children, and all that.
b	A.35 utt1	Uh huh,
b	A.35 utt2	yeah,
sd	A.35 utt3	I heard about that.
sd	A.35 utt4	I guess a friend of mine had a, well,
sd	A.35 utt5	she just started up a day care center,
sd	A.35 utt6	and one of the real strict, restrictions, was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff
b	B.36 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.37 utt1	so, she had that done.
qy	B.38 utt1	Have you painted anything recently.
na@	A.39 utt1	Well, so to speak, I had to paint the inside of this warehouse thing * I would have put a slash after the answer "so to speak" that you keep some, farm equipment in
qy	B.40 utt1	Wow, was it huge?
ny	B.42 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.43 utt1	and, what I had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer,
sd	A.43 utt2	and, I had this big five gallon jug,
sd	A.43 utt3	and it was like paint thinner.
sd	A.43 utt4	I mean you know, it looked just like, it was the viscosity of paint thinner
b	B.44 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.45 utt1	but, you just took a roller and put it on there,
sd	A.45 utt2	and, if you saw that the wood was getting wet, you know, that was all you needed.
ba	B.46 utt1	Wow.
b	A.47 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.47 utt2	it was,
sd	A.47 utt3	it used all of it.
sd	A.47 utt4	I guess it was about three hundred yards worth.
sd	A.47 utt5	So. Well, I guess it worked out.
sd	A.47 utt6	It was pretty easy, actually.
b	B.48 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.48 utt2	I think though, we're lucky that we didn't have to do any detail work, because I don't know if I could, you know,
h	B.48 utt3	I don't know,
h	B.50 utt1	I don't know,
sv	B.50 utt2	must be difficult,
qo	A.51 utt1	Well what about the trim in your house?
qy	A.51 utt2	Did you have to do that?
nn	B.52 utt1	No,
sd^e	B.52 utt2	it was really easy,
sd	B.52 utt3	I just, like, what,
sd	B.52 utt4	we had a couple of different size brushes you know, real easy,
b	A.53 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.54 utt2	I went around the trim,
sd	B.54 utt4	and there was wall paper,
sd	B.54 utt5	like I was just doing just the trim around the doors and windows
sd^r	B.54 utt6	and there was wall paper
sd	B.54 utt7	and if we got it on the wall paper a little bit, we just wipe it right away before it dried,
b	A.55 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.56 utt2	it came right off
b	A.57 utt1	yeah,
sd	B.58 utt1	so there was no major mistakes,
qr	A.59 utt1	Did you have, one coat or two?
sd	B.60 utt1	two, actually
b	A.61 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.62 utt3	you know, around the windows, if you got it on the glass, we let it dry and scraped it after that
b	A.63 utt2	Yeah,
sv	A.63 utt3	that would be really a time saver.
aa	B.64 utt1	Well, yeah,
sd	B.64 utt2	if you just, you know
sd	B.64 utt3	we didn't tape anything,
sd	B.66 utt1	we weren't that careful,
sd	B.66 utt2	but it wasn't, you know,
h	B.66 utt3	I don't know, it's funny,
sd	B.66 utt4	it's like, if you just go slow, or at least I didn't get that many mistakes
b	A.67 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.68 utt1	I didn't make that many mistakes,
sd	A.69 utt1	me, I would have had to have taped the whole thing, and then brushed around the edges,
sd	A.69 utt2	and then I'd have probably rolled it on.
sd	A.69 utt3	it would have taken me forever.
qw	B.70 utt1	Why?
qrr	B.70 utt2	Just because you'd be afraid to do it, or have you done it before.
b	A.71 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.71 utt2	well, the first time it'd probably would have taken me forever,
sd	B.72 utt1	Well, it wasn't,
sd	B.72 utt2	if it was my own I would have,
sd(^q)	B.72 utt3	but my friend said, just go ahead, you just go ahead, it's easy.
sd(^q)	B.74 utt2	I said, Okay, it's your place,
qw	A.75 utt1	Well, how long did it take you all?
sd	B.76 utt1	Well, a couple of week ends
sd	B.76 utt2	we would go down two or three hours on the weekends,
b	A.77 utt1	Uh huh.
qy^d	A.79 utt1	So there was two of you all?
nn	B.80 utt1	No,
sd^e	B.80 utt2	they were doing all sorts of repairs,
sd	B.80 utt3	and I was just painting because I don't know how to do anything else .
sv	A.81 utt1	Well, that's easy enough.
sd	B.82 utt1	So, there's a whole bunch of people.
sd	B.84 utt1	So now I feel like if I ever buy a house, I can probably paint, if nothing else.
sd	A.85 utt1	I think I could probably do it as long as the hardware store told me what to buy, then I could do it.
b	B.86 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.88 utt1	But you know, I went in to a hardware store to get paint for those toys,
sd(^q)	B.88 utt2	and the guy said, get this, it's a nice shiny gloss, which was true,
sd	B.90 utt1	but I didn't realize what, you know, pain it is to clean the brushes and everything, if you don't have latex
sd	B.90 utt2	I don't if
sd	B.90 utt3	it's worth the shine,
b	A.91 utt1	Uh huh.
