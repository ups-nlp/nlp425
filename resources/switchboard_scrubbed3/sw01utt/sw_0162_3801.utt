qy	A.1 utt1	Well, got any problems on Mockingbird with crime
qrr	A.1 utt2	or is that a crime free zone there?
nn	B.2 utt1	No,
sv^e	B.2 utt2	I don't think there is any such thing, as a crime free zone any longer.
sv	A.5 utt1	I'm afraid you're right.
sd(^q)	B.6 utt1	one evening I decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought, well, something's happens on Mockingbird and then heard yells and screams
sd	B.6 utt2	and the next thing I know there are policemen all around my house.
ba	A.7 utt1	my.
sd	B.8 utt1	And they had stopped a stolen car and caught one of the men in the hedge
ba	A.9 utt1	boy.
sd	B.10 utt2	and then the other one was on the roof in the back.
qy	A.11 utt1	By your house?
nd	B.12 utt1	on my house .
ba	A.13 utt1	my goodness.
sd	B.16 utt1	So I'm very much aware of, crime in the cities and the concern about it.
sv	A.17 utt2	that's got to be a frightening way to spend an evening.
sd	B.18 utt1	It was.
sd	B.20 utt1	I kept hearing noises
sd	B.20 utt2	and so I knew that I was not going to sleep until I got up and went out and checked the garage,
sd	B.20 utt3	so I got my gun and walked you know, through the house into the garage.
sd	B.20 utt4	There was no one there,
sd	B.20 utt5	but I wanted to be sure.
ba	A.21 utt1	boy.
qy	B.22 utt1	Is Plano beginning to experience the kinds of things that are more common in the metropolitan, you know, in the urban area?
ny	A.23 utt1	Unfortunately yes.
ba	B.26 utt1	That's too bad.
b	A.27 utt1	Yes.
sv	A.29 utt1	I think, you know, as any city grows up, you get the hoods and the riffraff and everybody else in there,
b	B.30 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.32 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.33 utt2	and I think,
sd	A.33 utt3	you know, fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on Spring Creek,
sd	A.33 utt4	but, we've lived here sixteen years
sd	A.33 utt5	and now you know, you can tell the change, for sure.
b	B.34 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.36 utt1	Well, I was thinking, if you've been there that long, you've seen Plano grow from what was really a small town to a city.
aa	A.37 utt1	Yes.
sv	A.39 utt1	Well, with all the, Central Expressway, with all the stores and the, restaurants and the convenience stores and all that kind of stuff, it's just prime pickings for people driving by.
b	B.42 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.44 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.46 utt1	Well, I was appalled to read the other day about the, shooting on the tollway.
sv	A.47 utt1	that couldn't be too far from you, neither.
sd	B.48 utt1	well, it's farther west of me.
bk	A.49 utt1	Okay.
sd	B.50 utt1	I live over near White Rock Lake.
b	A.51 utt1	yes,
bk	A.51 utt2	okay.
sd	B.54 utt1	it was really frightening to, think that, it's not even safe to drive onto the tollway, or for those people in the tollbooth.
sd	B.60 utt1	I never thought about someone robbing those,
sd	B.60 utt2	but, apparently, they do.
sd	A.61 utt1	I don't know, how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody
aa	B.62 utt1	Yeah,
qy^g	B.62 utt2	it just doesn't seem possible, does it.
qy^g	A.63 utt1	It's kind of stupid, isn't it.
ny	B.64 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.65 utt1	But I guess when people do those things, they don't really give a thought of the consequences at the time.
sv	A.65 utt2	It's, looks like easy pickings
aa	B.66 utt1	No.
qy^g	A.67 utt2	and away you go, right.
ny	B.68 utt1	Yeah,
sv^e	B.68 utt2	and I think the drugs play a tremendous part in, the theft and the violence that we see.
aa	A.69 utt1	I think you're right, although I think that may be an excuse for people, too.
qy^g	B.70 utt1	it is convenient, isn't it?
na	A.71 utt1	Right.
^q	B.72 utt1	I didn't know what I was doing.
aa	A.73 utt1	Right.
aa	A.75 utt1	Right,
sd	A.75 utt2	just like the old alcohol idea
sv	A.75 utt3	and I think when you have haves and have nots, you're always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money.
b	B.76 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.78 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	B.80 utt1	Well, yes,
sd	B.80 utt2	and I work in South Dallas for the Dallas School System.
ba	A.81 utt1	boy.
qw	A.83 utt1	Where do you work?
qy	B.84 utt1	do you know where Oakland and Hatcher are?
ny	A.85 utt1	yes,
sd^e	A.85 utt2	I think I do.
qy	A.85 utt3	is that Amelia Earhart, School there?
nn	B.86 utt1	no
sd^e	B.86 utt2	this is over near Lincoln High School. not far off South Central Expressway.
bk	A.87 utt1	Okay.
qy^g	A.89 utt1	That's a pretty rough area there, isn't it?
na^m	B.90 utt1	It is a pretty rough area.
sd	B.90 utt2	We're over by Fair Park.
ba	A.91 utt1	my goodness.
sd	B.92 utt1	And, you know, you watch the people.
sd	B.92 utt2	There are marvelous B M W s and Mercedes and Cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns.
sd	B.94 utt1	And the kids see that
sd	B.94 utt2	and, they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day you know, running for, drug dealers if,
sv	A.95 utt1	Definitely that area, that's big time.
b	B.96 utt1	Uh huh.
sv^r	A.97 utt1	Big time there, sure is.
aa	B.98 utt1	It surely is.
sd	A.99 utt1	I don't think I'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself .
sd	B.100 utt1	Well, I'm careful.
ba	A.101 utt1	Gee ,
sv	A.101 utt2	that's the worst neighborhood in the whole area.
aa	B.102 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.102 utt2	it's, a little scary sometimes
sd	B.102 utt3	and, I manage the,
