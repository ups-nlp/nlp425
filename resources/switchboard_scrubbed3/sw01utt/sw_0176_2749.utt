qy^g	A.1 utt1	Well, I don't have strong feelings about changes to be made in the, jury system, do you?
ng	B.2 utt1	not at all.
sd	B.2 utt2	In fact, I'm graduating from college in about a week
sd	B.2 utt3	and this past semester I've taken two criminal justice classes and have discussed a lot on trials.
sv	A.3 utt1	well then you must know a lot more about this than I do .
sv	B.4 utt1	I think, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine.
sv	B.4 utt2	I think it should be by a jury.
sv	B.4 utt3	I don't think the judge should have, I mean
sv	B.4 utt4	he's just there kind of like the referee .
b	A.5 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	A.5 utt2	Uh huh.
sv	B.6 utt1	I don't even think that it should be unanimous either.
qo	A.7 utt1	Well, what about the idea that one is only guilty, when proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt?
sd	A.7 utt2	I thought that was the point of, a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt.
b	B.8 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.10 utt1	Right.
sv	A.11 utt1	But, if there are some people who don't agree it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people.
aa	B.12 utt1	Exactly.
b	B.14 utt1	Uh huh.
h	B.14 utt2	I don't know.
sd	B.14 utt4	you rarely hear, you hear, of course there's cases where someone has been put in, in, prison, falsely accused
sv	B.14 utt5	but, more than likely the people that are on the jury know what they're doing.
bh	A.15 utt1	Really?
qy	A.15 utt2	Have you served on a jury?
ng	B.16 utt1	Never.
sd	A.17 utt1	I never have either,
sd	A.17 utt2	but my few friends who have, say just the opposite .
sd	A.17 utt3	They say they're, remarkably incompetent. And, don't know what they're doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out to air, and all that.
sv	B.18 utt1	Well, you would think that they would get that in the,
sv	B.18 utt2	when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would come out
sv	B.18 utt3	and I know they automatically,
sv	B.18 utt4	when you're chosen is, you're automatically like a, a professor in criminal justice or something like that,
sv	B.18 utt5	that you're automatically,
sv	B.18 utt7	they don't want you on the jury.
aa	A.19 utt1	Right,
sd	A.19 utt2	, they don't want anyone with exper , anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system.
aa	B.20 utt1	Exactly.
aa	B.22 utt1	Uh huh,
aa	B.22 utt2	exactly.
sv	A.23 utt1	And they tend,
sv	A.23 utt2	and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they don't want to do it,
sv	A.23 utt3	I mean, you know, it's anyone can get out of jury just about,
sv	A.23 utt4	so, it's, it's not really my peers that,
sd	A.23 utt5	let's say I were arrested falsely or not and put up for a jury I wouldn't feel that, I would be being tried by a jury of my peers.
b	B.24 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.25 utt2	I mean I'd be tried by a jury of , you know, people who had nothing else to do and weren't very knowledgeable about certain sorts of things,
h	A.25 utt3	and, I don't know,
b	B.26 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.27 utt2	I get a little bit nervous about it,
sd	B.28 utt1	I've never , I've never even been called to jury duty.
b	A.29 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.29 utt2	I was called once,
sd	A.29 utt3	but I was out of the country,
sd	A.29 utt4	and apparently they thought I served
sd	A.29 utt5	so I didn't make any noise about it .
sd	A.31 utt1	I came back
sd	A.31 utt2	and they said the record showed I served,
sd	A.31 utt3	but I was out of the country at the time,
sd	A.31 utt4	so I'm pretty sure I didn't.
b	B.32 utt1	Yeah.
h	B.32 utt2	I don't know,
sv	B.32 utt3	I guess there's a lot of problems with the legal system .
b	A.33 utt1	Yeah,
h	A.33 utt2	well, , I, I don't know,
sv	A.33 utt3	I definitely feel like we need to keep it at least unanimous
sv	A.33 utt4	because, you know, there's the classic sort of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD kind of story where you get, you know, jury which can have all kinds of prejudices and things that, a judge at least officially isn't supposed to have. Though, of course they can, too. / * This last sentence really appears to be an independent slash unit
b	B.34 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.36 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.37 utt1	And, it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much you know, browbeat the jury, of the, a majority of the jury,
b	B.38 utt1	Uh huh.
h	A.39 utt2	that's hard to say.
sv(^q)	A.39 utt3	so, it's, you know, saying, well, look we don't like the way he looks
^q	A.39 utt4	and, let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff.
b	B.40 utt1	Right.
sv	A.41 utt1	And you also get a lot of, juries are extremely,
h	A.41 utt2	and from what I hear,
sd	A.41 utt3	I have, I have some friends who do expert witness testimony
sd	A.41 utt4	and they say that, juries are extremely vulnerable to, sort of emotional pitches, you know,
sd	A.41 utt5	the prosecutor will want to, I don't know show the mugging victim, you know, show the nice person he was and what a family life, and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim,
sd	A.41 utt6	or, or, if it's a corporation, that was, you know, harming some individual or something like that, they get very much, well, you know,
sd	A.41 utt7	it's just a big faceless corporation.
sd(^q)	A.41 utt8	let's make them pay as much as possible. Things like that.
b	B.42 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.43 utt4	the problem is I can't guarantee that a judge would necessarily be much better than a jury,
sd	A.43 utt5	but I'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be, things like that.
sv	B.46 utt1	I do , I don't think the judge should just make the decision alone.
b	A.47 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.48 utt1	Least with the jury you have twelve people, you know that are going to decide, you know,
b	A.49 utt1	Uh huh.
sd@	B.50 utt2	you're the person's fate. / * This really is part of utt1
qo	A.51 utt1	Well, how about having a jury and a judge work together on it somehow?
qy^d	A.51 utt2	I wonder if that's possible?
sv	A.51 utt3	I guess the judge's time is worth too much, though.
aa	B.52 utt1	Exac ,
sv	A.53 utt1	they pay those jury members very little money compared to that judge .
aa	B.54 utt1	Right,
aa	B.54 utt2	exactly .
sv	A.55 utt1	He makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together.
am	B.56 utt1	Probably,
aa	B.56 utt2	yeah .
aa^r	B.56 utt3	Yeah.
sv	B.56 utt5	it's sad, though, that the people, though, that
sd	B.56 utt6	you, somebody's life is in twelve people's hands
sv	B.56 utt7	and sometimes those twelve people could care less.
b	A.57 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	A.57 utt2	uh huh.
sv	B.58 utt1	or they fool the defense in thinking that they're, you know,
sv	B.58 utt2	because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want.
aa	A.59 utt1	of course.
sv	A.59 utt2	it's political maneuvering.
sv	A.59 utt3	the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will, you know, want to hang everyone,
sv	A.59 utt4	and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic.
sv	A.59 utt5	They're not looking for someone whose going to be the most reasoned or sensible or rational juror. / * whose > who's
sv	A.59 utt6	Neither side wants that.
sv	A.59 utt7	They want to find a juror that's going to, be most persuadable by their arguments, you know.
aa	B.60 utt1	Exactly.
sd	A.61 utt1	I wish it were a little bit harder to not serve on juries actually.
sd	A.61 utt2	I mean, I know, it, it's tricky
sd	A.61 utt3	because I know, you know, an awful lot of intelligent people who just, well
^q	A.61 utt4	I'm too busy to serve on a jury,
b	B.62 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.63 utt1	so I'll tell them that
sd	A.63 utt2	and they or just, you know, just answer one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that, you know,
b	B.64 utt1	yeah.
sd(^q)	A.65 utt1	they just say do you believe in such and such.
sv	B.66 utt1	I guess it's just that maybe people are, you know, upset at court, you know.
sv	B.66 utt2	if it was a family member of theirs, though that was innocent
sv	B.66 utt3	and, then they'd want to be on that jury.
aa	A.67 utt1	Right.
sv	A.67 utt2	Course, they would be barred,
sv	B.68 utt1	But, I think if everyone took it seriously
b	A.69 utt1	Uh huh.
sv@	B.70 utt1	and, I mean, something you have to do . / * This really seems to be just a continuation of B.68, not an indep slash unit
b	A.71 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.71 utt2	well it sounds like we both need to get out there and serve on a jury.
b	B.72 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.73 utt1	I hope we're called up before too long.
sd	B.74 utt1	I would love to be called,
sd	B.74 utt2	I'm ready to go .
sd	B.74 utt3	They just haven't called me up yet .
sv	A.75 utt1	they will eventually.
b	A.77 utt1	Okay,
fc	A.77 utt2	well it was nice talking with you.
fc	B.78 utt1	It was nice talking to you.
fc	A.79 utt1	Bye bye.
fc	B.80 utt1	Bye bye.
