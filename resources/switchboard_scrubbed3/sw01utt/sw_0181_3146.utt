o	A.1 utt1	Okay.
fp	B.2 utt1	Hi, Nancy.
qy	B.4 utt1	Well, do you do a lot of dining out?
nn	A.5 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.5 utt2	we don't although we enjoy it.
sd	A.5 utt3	we do it more when we have company come.
b	B.6 utt1	Uh huh.
qo	A.7 utt1	what about you?
sd	B.8 utt1	Well, we do some dining out.
sd	B.8 utt2	I do a lot of cooking
sd	B.8 utt3	so, mostly like when we go out, you know, it's my husband and I,
sd	B.8 utt4	we don't go out too often as a family, unless it's like a fast food kind of thing.
sd	B.8 utt5	but we do enjoy dining out.
sd	B.8 utt6	One of our favorite places here in the Dallas area is Atlantic Cafe.
qy	B.8 utt7	I don't know if you, have you ever been there?
sd	A.9 utt1	I've heard of that
ng	A.9 utt2	but I haven't been there.
qw	A.9 utt3	where, about is that?
sd	B.12 utt1	well actually there's the Atlantic Cafe and Cafe Pacific, and,
bk	A.13 utt1	okay.
sd	A.13 utt2	I've been to Cafe Pacific.
bh	B.14 utt1	Have you?
sd	B.14 utt2	now that's down in, Highland Park.
aa	A.15 utt1	Right.
sd	B.16 utt1	It's Highland Park Village.
qy	B.16 utt2	Did you like it?
ny	A.17 utt1	Yes.
sd	B.18 utt1	I love it .
sd	A.19 utt1	Before we moved to, the area, my brother, lived in Dallas for a number of years
sd	A.21 utt2	and we came up one time when my father was visiting
sd	A.21 utt3	and we all ate there
b	B.22 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.23 utt2	and, their seafood was wonderful.
sv	B.24 utt1	it's fabulous.
sv	B.24 utt2	It really is a great place.
qw	A.25 utt1	Now where is the Atlantic Cafe?
sd	B.26 utt1	Atlantic Cafe is down I believe it's on McKinney.
bk	A.27 utt1	okay.
sd	B.28 utt1	and originally the two, the guy who owns the Cafe Pacific and the guy who owns the Atlantic Cafe, were partners in the Atlantic Cafe.
sd	B.28 utt2	And then they separated
sd	B.28 utt3	and the guy started Cafe Pacific.
sd	B.28 utt4	And, I loved them both.
sd	B.28 utt5	I really do.
sd	B.28 utt6	I think they're wonderful.
sd	B.28 utt7	That's our favorite.
sd	B.28 utt8	You know what we'd really like, if we just have a casual evening is Houston's.
qy	B.28 utt9	Have you been there?
nn	A.29 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.29 utt2	but I've heard that's really good, too,
sd	B.30 utt1	It's wonderful.
sd	B.30 utt2	The only thing is you have to wait.
sd	B.30 utt3	you have to expect to wait at least an hour.
b	A.31 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.32 utt1	So you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in.
sd	B.32 utt2	And, as long as you know that , it's okay.
sd	B.32 utt3	But they have, I think, just about the best prime rib anywhere in the area.
b	A.33 utt1	Oh.
bk	A.35 utt1	okay.
sd	B.36 utt2	I love it.
b	A.37 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.38 utt1	And, my husband really likes their ribs.
sd	B.38 utt2	So it's hysterical.
sd	B.38 utt3	We go in
sd	B.38 utt4	and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in
sd	B.38 utt5	and then we get there
sd	B.38 utt6	and we don't even look at the menu .
bf	A.39 utt1	You know right away what you want .
sd^m	B.40 utt1	I know right away what we want.
aa	B.40 utt2	Yeah.
aa^r	B.40 utt3	Yeah.
sd	A.41 utt1	Well, we really enjoy prime rib, too,
sd	A.41 utt2	and, actually the Steak And Ale out here, we've gone to,
sd	A.43 utt2	my in laws also enjoy prime rib, when they've had some of their specials on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday night
b	B.44 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.46 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.47 utt1	and, the time we went the prime rib was really good.
bh	B.48 utt1	Was it?
bh	B.48 utt2	Really?
sd	B.48 utt3	I've, I've been there for like, you know, lunch
b	A.49 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.50 utt1	but, I've never been there for dinner.
sd	B.50 utt2	And, it was good,
b	A.51 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.51 utt2	yeah .
ba	B.52 utt1	that's great.
ba^r	B.52 utt2	That's, great.
sd	B.54 utt2	Another nice place for prime rib is Baby Doe's
sd	A.55 utt1	I've heard about that, too
sd	B.56 utt1	Maxwell's nice,
qy	B.56 utt2	have you been there?
nn	A.57 utt1	but no.
sd	A.57 utt2	I guess we eat out even less than I realize .
sd	B.58 utt1	And I didn't think we ate out very often .
o	B.58 utt2	See!
sd	B.58 utt3	Baby Doe's is nice.
b	A.59 utt1	Oh .
sd	B.60 utt1	And, one place I'd never been that I would really like to go to, is Lawry's.
sd	B.60 utt2	I've heard that's real good, Lawry's Prime Rib?
b	A.61 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.63 utt1	Yes,
sd	A.63 utt2	I had heard that, too.
sd	B.64 utt1	I've never been there
sd^r	B.64 utt2	but I've heard it's real good.
qy	A.65 utt1	Have you been to the little, not for prime rib but the Cafe De France, right here on Central Expressway? * slash error okay. / * slash error should be bk
ny	B.66 utt1	Yes.
ny	B.68 utt1	Yes,
sd^e	B.68 utt2	actually they have one in Richardson that I've been to.
sd	B.70 utt1	they have real nice lunches.
qy	B.70 utt2	have you been there for lunch?
ny	A.71 utt1	Yes,
b	B.72 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.73 utt1	primarily lunch, well, and breakfast sometimes
sd	A.73 utt2	but, during the week they often have, a limited menu choice but, very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety nine that included the soup or salad entrees and accompaniments and dessert
bh	B.74 utt1	Really?
bh	B.76 utt1	Really?
sd	A.77 utt3	my husband and I like veal, a lot
b	B.78 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.79 utt2	and their veal dishes have been good.
sd	A.79 utt3	We've tried different ones when they've had them as one of the
^2	B.80 utt1	The specials.
aa	A.81 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	B.82 utt1	Have you ever been to Biffin's?
sd	B.84 utt1	I keep hearing about it.
sd	B.84 utt2	I keep hearing the advertisements of it
aa	A.85 utt2	yes,
ar	A.85 utt3	no,
sd(^q)	B.86 utt1	and they keep saying, you know, it's wonderful, it's wonderful.
sd	B.86 utt2	I have not been over there
sd	B.86 utt3	and I was thinking, you know, it's supposed to be a family place over near Plano Super Bowl.
b	A.87 utt1	Right.
sd^r	B.88 utt1	And, I've not been there.
sd	A.89 utt1	I haven't either,
sd	A.89 utt2	one place,
sd	A.89 utt3	and I've only been there for lunch,
sd	A.89 utt4	but, I went with a friend,
sd	A.89 utt5	and we met her husband, down on Greenville,
sd	A.89 utt6	down near the Highway Twelve area, is Gershwin's,
sd	B.90 utt1	I've been there.
sd	B.92 utt1	That was nice .
aa	A.93 utt1	It was
sd	A.93 utt2	and we had the, we both enjoy mushroom soup
sd	A.95 utt2	and Linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup
sd	A.95 utt3	and they did.
sd	A.95 utt4	It was wonderful
sd	A.95 utt5	and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert , which was a chocolate sack.
qy^d	A.97 utt2	I don't know if you tried
sd	B.100 utt1	I've heard of it.
sd	B.100 utt2	where it's made,
sd	B.100 utt4	it's all chocolate, like made like a paper bag
aa	A.101 utt1	Yes!
qy^d	B.102 utt1	and it's filled with what, whip cream and strawberries and something?
ny@	A.103 utt1	yes * Shouldn't this end in a slash? it had a sponge cake * I really think this should be the start of a new slash unit. and whip cream
b	B.106 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.107 utt2	and it had strawberries, kiwis, and raspberries in a raspberry, puree
b	B.108 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.109 utt2	and, and we shared one, the three of us
b	B.110 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.111 utt2	and it was plenty because it was very rich
sd	A.111 utt3	but, I wished I'd had a camera.
b	B.112 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.113 utt2	It was beautiful .
ba	B.114 utt1	I bet it was.
ba^r	B.114 utt2	I bet it was.
sd	B.116 utt1	The last time we went to Cafe Pacific, it was Father's Day,
sd	B.116 utt2	and we took another friend with us
b	A.117 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.118 utt2	and, for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves .
sd	B.118 utt3	And so they had, like a berry assortment.
sd	B.118 utt4	it was raspberries and blueberries and strawberries on a plate with like a custard on the bottom.
b	A.119 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.120 utt2	And, you know, they did, like the raspberry puree, just kind of like in a decoration on the,
sd	B.120 utt3	you know, how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it
b	A.121 utt1	Yes.
b	A.121 utt2	Yeah .
b	A.123 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.124 utt1	and it was outstanding.
ba	A.125 utt1	It sounds wonderful.
sd	B.126 utt1	It was really relatively simple
sd	B.126 utt2	but, it was good.
sd	B.126 utt3	It was really good.
sd	A.127 utt1	Well, that's, one of the things that I do enjoy when you get a good restaurant.
sd	A.127 utt2	I love fresh berries.
sd	A.127 utt3	And, their fruits are always exceptional.
sd	A.127 utt4	I'm, know
sd	A.127 utt5	they must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer's Market, you can't find them like that
^2	B.128 utt1	You can't find them.
b	B.130 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.132 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.132 utt2	yeah,
b^r	B.132 utt3	yeah.
sd	B.132 utt4	You know, I'm originally from Connecticut
sd	B.132 utt5	and, I was home a few years ago
sd	B.132 utt6	and my sister and brother in law were going to take us out for dinner
sd	B.132 utt7	and, I was really amazed, you know,
sd	B.132 utt8	the restaurants up there were kind of quaint.
sd	B.132 utt9	You know, they were real, real pretty
sd	B.132 utt10	but they lacked, the service
sd	B.132 utt11	and they lacked the, just the, I don't know.
sd	B.132 utt12	The restaurants down here seem like they have,
sd	B.132 utt13	I guess there's so much competition that they, really have to be good.
b	A.133 utt1	Uh huh.
sd(^q)	B.134 utt1	And, I thought I would really miss that.
aa	A.135 utt1	I would, too,
sd	A.135 utt2	because, well, because we don't go out very often.
sd	A.137 utt2	When we do go out, in a way it's like a little mini vacation I guess,
sd	A.137 utt3	and, it's a whole experience.
sv	A.137 utt4	Of course you want the food to be good
sv	A.137 utt5	but the atmosphere and service I think, are important, too.
b	B.138 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.140 utt1	And, you know, in order to survive in this area , I think they have to be good.
b	A.141 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.142 utt1	Because the ones that aren't so good just don't make it.
sd	A.143 utt1	that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track
sd	A.143 utt2	but it is wonderful.
sd	A.143 utt3	It's called Cafe Max
sd	A.143 utt4	and it's at Plano Road and Campbell.
sd	A.143 utt5	They have the most wonderful salads.
sd	A.143 utt6	They do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three.
bh	B.144 utt1	really?
