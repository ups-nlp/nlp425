qy	B.1 utt1	Do you have any?
na	A.2 utt1	Sure.
sd	A.2 utt2	I have a Springer Spaniel,
sd	A.2 utt3	and her name is Thumper.
sd	A.2 utt4	She's about seven or eight years old.
sd	A.2 utt5	I got her for Christmas from my family, back when we lived in Nebraska.
sd	A.2 utt6	I like to hunt,
sd	A.2 utt7	and, so, I thought that if I had a good hunting dog like Thumper that, I could just go out and get all kinds of game .
qy	B.3 utt1	Did it work? .
ny	A.4 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.4 utt2	except we live in Plano, Texas now
aa	B.5 utt1	No,
aa	B.5 utt2	right.
sd	B.7 utt1	I had a, for many years I had a dog that was part Springer Spaniel.
sd	B.7 utt2	I just love them.
sd	B.7 utt3	Her name was Molly,
sd	B.7 utt4	but she isn't alive any more .
sd	B.7 utt5	We had her for, fifteen years, I think, my family did, and just loved her.
sd	B.7 utt6	She was the greatest, went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle.
qy	A.8 utt1	Do you have a pet now?
ny	B.9 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.9 utt2	I have a cat now.
sd	B.9 utt3	He just turned seven, also,
sd	B.9 utt4	and I, got him in Arizona when I used to live there,
sd	B.11 utt2	and he is huge.
sd	B.11 utt3	He is eighteen pounds.
qw	A.12 utt1	What kind of cat is it?
sd	B.13 utt2	I got him,
sd	B.13 utt3	he was born in the wild, like in a shed and had never been in a building when I got him.
b	A.14 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.15 utt3	and he, he must be cross part with some kind of desert animal, because he's very long and lanky,
sd	B.15 utt4	but he's a very tame spoiled house cat, you know, now that I've had him for seven years.
qy^d	A.16 utt1	Being born outside, you didn't have any problems house training him?
nn	B.17 utt1	No,
nn^r	B.17 utt2	no
ba	A.18 utt1	That's good.
aa	B.19 utt2	yeah,
sd	B.19 utt3	he's great,
sd	B.19 utt4	and he's really spoiled, though .
sd	B.19 utt5	but he's really big,
sd	B.19 utt6	so, lots of times it, he seems to get in fights,
sd	B.19 utt7	and when he was younger I think he started them,
sd	B.19 utt8	and now, I think he barely makes it.
sd	B.19 utt9	I think he gets beat up even though he's big, because he's pretty much overweight, and comes home with a few scratches now and then,
b	A.20 utt1	Sure.
^2	A.22 utt1	And older .
b	B.25 utt1	yeah.
sd	A.26 utt1	Well, we went to a cat show at the Plano Center here in town,
sd(^q)	A.26 utt2	and, we thought that, we have a cat now,
sd	A.26 utt3	but we thought, Well, if we ever get another cat, you know, we'd want something kind of unique,
sd	A.26 utt4	so, we kind of looked around,
sd	A.26 utt5	and they had everything from hairless cats to Siamese cats and Persian cats
sd	A.26 utt6	and we sort of fell in love with the, Maine Coon cats.
sd	B.27 utt1	I've seen them.
sd	A.28 utt1	They're huge.
aa	B.29 utt1	yeah,
sd^r	B.29 utt2	I have seen them.
sd	B.29 utt4	actually, I can't remember,
sd	B.29 utt5	they used to be used on ships and for, for mousers you know,
b	A.30 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.31 utt2	so they're very nautical, too .
ba	A.32 utt1	I'll be darned.
sd	A.32 utt2	I didn't know that.
b	B.33 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.33 utt3	I think I'm being accurate in the area of folklore,
sd	B.33 utt4	but I'm not sure.
ba	A.34 utt1	Well that's interesting.
b	B.35 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.36 utt1	We kind of like,
sd	A.36 utt2	well, my family didn't necessarily like them as much as I did,
sd	A.36 utt3	but the Manx, is that the one that doesn't have a tail
b	B.37 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.38 utt1	it sort of has a bob tail.
sd	A.38 utt2	I kind of like that, too,
b	B.39 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.39 utt2	I'd love to go to a cat show.
sd	B.39 utt3	I'm a real cat lover.
sd	B.39 utt4	I'd have a lot more cats if my boyfriend would let me .
sd	B.41 utt1	He doesn't really like mine, let alone another one.
co	A.42 utt1	Well, I'll tell you an interesting story about how I got my dog,
sv^t	A.42 utt2	and then I suppose our five minutes will be up.
aa	B.43 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.43 utt2	Okay.
sd	A.44 utt1	I work for a university,
sd	A.44 utt2	and I went to, Omaha, Nebraska to recruit students,
sd	A.44 utt3	and I had some time off in the afternoon,
sd	A.44 utt4	so I went to a pet shop,
sd	A.44 utt5	and I saw these little Springer Spaniels
sd	A.46 utt1	and so I decided, well, you know, this would really be a nice dog to have,
sd	A.46 utt2	so, when I got back home to Carney, Nebraska, I told my wife about it,
sd(^q)	A.46 utt3	and I said, You know, this is just a,
^q	A.46 utt4	I, I can just hear the dog crying for me now .
ba	B.47 utt1	I know what you mean.
^q	A.48 utt1	And Christmas is coming up, hint, hint,
sd	A.48 utt2	and so, I had to go back the next week, as well as a bunch of other people from the university,
sd	A.48 utt3	and one of the people, that we went with, they were friends of ours,
sd	A.48 utt4	and so, we got to Omaha,
sd	A.48 utt5	and I decided I'd take my friend over and show him the dog,
sd	A.48 utt6	and so I got over there,
sd(^q)	A.48 utt7	and she said, that's too bad, the dog has already been sold.
sd	A.48 utt8	And I didn't realize it,
sd	A.48 utt9	but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier, bought the dog,
sd	A.48 utt10	and she was in the back room,
sd	A.48 utt11	and so that night we had a reception for some of the, potential high school students or college students,
sd	A.48 utt12	and, he had the dog the whole time in his room,
sd	A.48 utt13	and I had no idea.
sd	A.48 utt14	And so we headed back to Carney that night,
sd	A.48 utt15	and the dog rode in the car
sd	A.48 utt16	and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat
sd	A.48 utt17	and they left the dog in the car,
sd	A.48 utt18	and I guess while we were inside eating, Thumper just tore the heck out of the inside of the car,
sd	A.48 utt19	and, finally we made it back to, to Carney
