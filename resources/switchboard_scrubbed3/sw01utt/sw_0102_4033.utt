qw	A.1 utt1	So how do you get most of your current event information?
sd	B.2 utt1	Well, , see I'm going to school right now,
sd	B.2 utt2	and, while I'm working, I don't get a chance to read the paper a lot,
b	A.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.4 utt2	and I don't watch T V as much really either, because, my free time is kind of,
sd	B.4 utt3	and I like to do other stuff with it.
b	A.5 utt1	Right.
sd	B.6 utt1	While I'm at work sometimes, on the computer network I read the news sometimes,
b	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.8 utt2	and that's kind of helpful.
sv	A.9 utt1	I would imagine going to college, though, your professors and different things,
sv	A.9 utt2	you keep up on what's going on.
aa	B.10 utt1	That's true,
sd	B.10 utt2	I mean, my roommates and stuff, you know people around me talk about it.
b	A.11 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.12 utt2	And the people I work with are pretty, you know, up to date on that kind of stuff,
b	A.13 utt1	Right.
sd	A.13 utt2	Well, I'm a housewife,
sd	A.13 utt3	I have three kids,
sd	A.13 utt4	and so I get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then, talking with people and just hearing what's going on. .
b	B.14 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.16 utt1	Yeah.
qy	B.18 utt1	do you watch like major network news,
qrr	B.18 utt2	or do you watch like the MACNEIL LEHRER HOUR?
sd	A.19 utt1	Just the regular channel just channel eight.
b	B.22 utt1	really.
sd	A.23 utt1	That's our channel here
sd	A.23 utt2	that's the, eyewitness news.
b	B.24 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.26 utt1	see channel, where I am channel eight's, like public T V,
sd	B.26 utt2	so it's kind of different.
b	A.27 utt1	uh huh.
b	A.27 utt2	Yeah.
sv	B.28 utt1	I think the,
sv	B.28 utt2	I think a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks, like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on,
sv	B.28 utt3	but, it seems that, they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news.
aa	A.29 utt1	Right.
sv	A.29 utt2	And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not,
sv	A.29 utt3	and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name.
b	B.30 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.32 utt1	Yeah,
aa	B.32 utt2	exactly.
sv	A.33 utt1	I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it.
sv	A.33 utt2	I think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on.
b	B.34 utt1	Uh huh,
sv	B.34 utt2	because they can only report on, I mean,
sv	B.34 utt3	they give each candidate perhaps, you know, ten second blurbs in which you know, to say, you just can't get a full picture of, you know their message unless you have time to sit down and probably read something on it.
b	A.35 utt1	Right.
aa	A.37 utt1	Right.
sv	A.37 utt2	And the news, too, it just doesn't, cover that many stories,
sv	A.37 utt3	I mean, it just covers your basic, you know, violent crimes you know, and, and your catastrophes with weather and stuff,
b	B.38 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.39 utt2	but other than that, you really don't know what's going on.
b	B.40 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.41 utt1	I will read our current letters that come out on elections
sd	A.41 utt2	and, I guess I do read that,
sd	A.41 utt3	and I do study who's running in our area,
sd	A.41 utt4	and I do study what's going on in the economy.
sd	A.41 utt6	and, I guess I do read other magazines, too, to get my information.
qw	B.42 utt1	What kind of, see,
sd	B.42 utt2	I subscribe to like SCIENCE NEWS,
sd	B.42 utt3	and that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of, or like the updates, like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would, you know, bog me down that I wouldn't know about
b	A.43 utt1	Right.
sd	B.44 utt1	but other than that I don't really read,
sd	B.44 utt2	I don't really subscribe to anything else.
sd	A.45 utt1	I used to read every month a READER'S DIGEST
b	B.46 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.47 utt1	but, now I guess I just have friends that clip articles
sd	A.47 utt2	or if I, you know, am interested in something, of course, when we were in war, I read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on.
b	B.48 utt1	yeah.
sd	A.49 utt2	But a lot of the times, you know, I wish I had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper,
sd	A.49 utt3	but I just can't seem to find the time.
b	B.50 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.51 utt1	If they put it out in a video, or on , not a video but a cassette tape or something, where you could just listen to it I would do that while I was doing other things.
b	B.54 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.56 utt1	Well, I remember back during the war, everyone here at work always had the radio or the T V on, because they were going constantly with that stuff.
b	A.57 utt1	Right.
sd	A.59 utt1	Well, they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of,
sd	A.59 utt2	and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of Texas news.
sd	A.59 utt3	You know, we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas
b	B.60 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.61 utt1	that we want to hear what's going on with the economy, what's being done to help it, what's going on in other countries, what's, you know, just more information.
sv	B.62 utt1	if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would probably take the whole news hour .
b	A.63 utt1	Yeah.
qy^d	A.65 utt1	Well, I guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the, summer olympics .
ny	B.66 utt1	yeah,
sd	B.66 utt3	already they're having like,
sd	B.66 utt4	in the newspaper they have a section, I think, every now and then, on the Olympics, you know,
sd	B.66 utt5	and they've got like a countdown,
sd	B.66 utt6	it's like sixteen hundred days or something.
sd	A.67 utt1	I know, we're trying to get tickets to it right now.
bh	B.68 utt1	really?
ny	A.69 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.70 utt1	That's going to be crazy that time of year here.
b	A.73 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.74 utt1	I can't believe, I mean,
sd	B.74 utt2	they're stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over,
sd	B.74 utt3	I guess people want to hear about it.
sd	B.74 utt4	Also big in the news right now is the Braves, because they're in, you know, spring training or whatever
b	A.75 utt1	Right,
b^r	A.75 utt2	right.
sd	B.76 utt1	and they did so well last year.
b	A.77 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.77 utt2	that's another thing, they spend a long time on sports,
sd	A.77 utt3	and I think that's fine, I would like to see more time spent on other things.
b	B.78 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.80 utt1	It seems like,
h	B.80 utt2	I don't know,
sd	B.80 utt3	they way they do the newscasts, I wish they kind of separated it, you know,
sd	B.80 utt4	if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it
sd	B.80 utt5	but I don't have cable.
