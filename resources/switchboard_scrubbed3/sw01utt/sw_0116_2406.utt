o	A.1 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.2 utt1	Okay
sd^t	B.2 utt2	movies.
sd	B.2 utt3	I haven't seen too many lately.
sd	B.2 utt4	I have kids
sd	B.2 utt5	and we went and saw THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER, Under, over the break.
b	A.3 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	B.4 utt2	do you have kids you take to movies
nn	A.5 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.5 utt2	no kids.
b	B.6 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.6 utt2	It's a Walt Disney movie
sd	B.6 utt3	and it didn't get you know, as good a reviews as like the LITTLE MERMAID, their last one, and got all kinds of Academy Awards and things last year.
sd	B.6 utt4	But this one I thought was excellent.
qy	A.7 utt1	Was that the animated version?
ny	B.8 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.8 utt2	it's animated.
sd	B.8 utt3	And I can't believe how good they're getting with their animation now.
sd	B.8 utt4	It's just the special effects, you know.
sd	B.8 utt5	And in this movie, there's this boy
sd	B.8 utt6	and he rescues this, bald eagle
sd	B.8 utt7	and it's a huge eagle, you know, wing span of twenty feet or something like that.
sd	B.8 utt8	And the boy actually rides on his back
sd	B.8 utt9	and he rides through the clouds, you know,
sd	B.8 utt10	and you see him coming out of the clouds, his head coming out and then the bird coming out,
sd	B.8 utt11	and you know, they're flying all over with it.
sd	B.8 utt12	And I mean, I know there must have been computers or something for animation this day,
sd	B.8 utt13	but it was just so real, realistic and lifelike and good animation.
sd	B.8 utt14	It was a good show.
qy	A.9 utt1	Even better than ROGER RABBIT insofar as animation?
nd	B.10 utt1	Well, ROGER was a composite one.
b	A.11 utt1	Yeah .
sd	B.12 utt1	there's a movie I've seen, ROGER RABBIT.
sd	B.12 utt2	That's not a recent movie,
sd	B.12 utt3	but, I enjoyed that show.
b	A.13 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.13 utt2	that was made I don't know, several years back, I guess.
b	B.14 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.14 utt2	yeah.
sd	A.15 utt1	latest one I've saw which was a mistake to go see was LIONHEART,
sd	A.15 utt2	had Claude Van Damme.
b	B.16 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.17 utt1	he's of course, I guess he's trained in this, martial arts of some sort,
sd	A.17 utt2	but the plot was bland,
sd	A.17 utt3	the acting was bland.
sd	A.17 utt4	It was just mostly centered upon his abilities to
^2	B.18 utt1	Chop them up,
aa	A.19 utt1	yeah,
b^m	A.19 utt2	chop them up,
aa	A.19 utt3	exactly.
sd	B.20 utt1	This is supposed to be the guy that's, replaces Bruce Lee or whatever or, or the next Chuck Norris type of guy.
b	A.21 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.23 utt1	Or he's singular I guess, you know.
sv	A.23 utt2	You know how they can make any single one of them in a movie to be a super superstar of any sort, you know,
b	B.24 utt1	Uh huh.
^2	B.26 utt1	Superstar.
b	B.28 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.29 utt1	but Chuck Norris, of course, could be just about equal, if not more
b	B.30 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.31 utt2	and all of them, I guess, could be in that fashion, or category.
b	B.34 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	B.34 utt2	uh huh.
sd	A.35 utt1	It was about, a, French Foreign Legion fellow who deserts to go help his brother's wife who became a widow because he was selling drugs ,
sd	A.39 utt1	and he got killed.
qy^g	B.40 utt1	Really uplifting, ?
sd	A.41 utt1	So he deserts and goes to New York
sd	A.41 utt2	and he starts out by fighting to make money,
sd	A.41 utt3	and then he moves on to L A to where she is to just help him out.
b	B.42 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.43 utt1	I mean the Hollywood really must think there's some real dummies out there or something.
h	A.43 utt2	I don't know .
b	B.44 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.44 utt2	I hadn't heard much about that movie.
sd	B.44 utt4	other than it was a chop them up movie.
sd	B.44 utt5	But, well, I guess that's one I won't go see .
sd	A.45 utt1	Well, it was worth the buck I guess.
bf	B.46 utt1	you went to the dollar movie?
b	B.46 utt2	Yeah.
b^r	B.46 utt3	Yeah,
sd	B.46 utt4	they show up at the dollar movie right after they come out.
sv	B.46 utt5	You know they're usually not that great or didn't do that great anyway.
^h	B.48 utt1	Let me see.
^h^r	B.48 utt2	Let me see
sd	B.48 utt3	another movie I watched.
sd	B.48 utt4	I want to see, that new one, that won all those Academy Awards this year, DANCES WITH WOLVES.
b	A.49 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.50 utt1	I haven't seen that.
qy	B.50 utt2	Have you seen that one yet?
b	A.51 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.53 utt1	I absorbed all of that movie in one sitting.
sd	A.53 utt2	I guess what made it so good was the cinematography,
bf	B.54 utt1	the wide open, the spaces,
aa	A.55 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.55 utt2	and the music
sd	A.55 utt3	and, well, it had an excellent story line.
sd	A.55 utt4	Everything about it was good.
b	B.56 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.57 utt1	I thought an excellent one, too, was MISERY with Kathy Bates and James Caan.
sd	A.57 utt2	I'm not a James Caan fan,
sd	A.57 utt3	but that was a well directed and acted movie.
bh	B.58 utt1	Is that right?
sd	A.59 utt1	I'd recommend it.
sd	A.59 utt2	It's a little on the violent side
b	B.60 utt1	Uh huh.
qh	A.61 utt1	but then what movie isn't anymore.
aa	B.62 utt1	Right,
aa^r	B.62 utt2	right.
sd	B.62 utt4	our movies today, it used to be X
sd	B.62 utt5	you know, and P G s used to be R s
sv	B.62 utt6	and, seems like the rating system, you know, is kind of switching that way a little bit .
sd	A.63 utt1	Well, I have no objections to it.
sv	A.63 utt3	and it's a matter of your taste,
b	B.64 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.64 utt2	yeah.
b^r	B.64 utt3	yeah.
qy^d	B.64 utt6	it's just that the rating system seems, you know, instead of having X now, they have what, N C seventeen?
ny	A.65 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.66 utt1	They just changed it because X had a connotation with it, you know,
sv	A.67 utt1	And even on those type they don't show what you expect.
b	B.68 utt1	Right.
sv	B.70 utt1	A lot of those are really violent type movies.
b	A.71 utt1	Right.
sv	B.72 utt1	Really gory.
aa	A.73 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.73 utt2	that seems to be the norm of most movies,
o	A.73 utt3	but what the hey.
b	B.74 utt1	Yeah.
o	A.75 utt2	This is America.
^h	B.76 utt1	Let me see.
sd	B.76 utt2	One movie I saw, I guess it was a while back, RED OCTOBER.
b	A.77 utt1	Yeah.
qy	B.78 utt1	Have you seen that one?
ny	A.79 utt1	Yes,
sd^e	A.79 utt2	I have.
sd	A.79 utt3	That was pretty good.
aa	B.80 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.80 utt2	I read the book before
sd	B.80 utt3	so I knew the story line going in,
sd	B.80 utt4	but they changed some things in the movie.
sd	B.80 utt5	It wasn't the same.
sd	B.80 utt6	I thought the book was better than the movie,
sd	B.80 utt7	but I thought the movie was really good as well.
sd	A.81 utt1	I always wait for the movie.
sd	A.81 utt2	I don't have time to read the book.
aa	B.82 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.82 utt2	I don't,
sd	B.82 utt3	I read about one or two thick novels like that a year. You know,
b	A.83 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.84 utt2	that's about all the time I can spare.
sd	B.84 utt3	But that was a good show I thought, you know.
sd	B.84 utt4	I read about how they did, an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine.
sd	B.84 utt5	You know, that wasn't a real submarine you saw in the water.
sd	B.84 utt6	it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the Hollywood magic.
b	A.85 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.86 utt1	All those underwater scenes.
sd	B.86 utt3	it looked to me like it was a real submarine, that was in the water, you know.
sv	A.89 utt1	That's the magic of Hollywood, special effects.
b	B.90 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.91 utt1	I hear this movie F X part two coming out is, pretty good.
bh	B.92 utt1	Is that right?
qy	A.93 utt1	Did you ever see the original one?
na	B.94 utt1	I didn't.
sd	A.95 utt1	It was,
ad	A.95 utt2	you ought to rent the, F X part one.
sd	A.95 utt3	It doesn't say part one,
sd	A.95 utt4	but it's F slash X.
qw	B.96 utt1	What's that about?
sd	A.97 utt1	A, special effects man who somehow gets involved in this,
h	A.97 utt2	I'm not sure.
h	A.97 utt3	I can't remember.
sd	A.97 utt4	It's been a while since I've seen it.
sd	A.97 utt5	But he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings with somebody
sd	A.97 utt6	and he has to go underground,
sd	A.97 utt7	and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done.
bf	B.100 utt1	to fool people
aa	A.101 utt1	Right,
sd	A.101 utt2	and using makeup and using the all the props and whatever to get to where he needs to go.
^2	B.102 utt1	All the tricks.
b	B.104 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.104 utt2	That sounds like an interesting concept.
ad	A.105 utt1	But you need to rent the first one first.
qy^d	B.106 utt1	To understand what's going on in the second?
sd	A.107 utt1	if that is that the second one follows the first.
sd	A.107 utt2	I don't know if they have the, original actors on that first one to that one.
b	B.108 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.108 utt2	They're supposed to be coming out with all these Desert Storm movies, this summer, too .
b	A.109 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.111 utt1	I expected those.
b	B.112 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.113 utt1	I mean they were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there, I think.
b	B.114 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.114 utt3	in some of those, you know, I guess they retitled some movies that were going to be about Lebanese and, you know, and, and Americans
b	A.115 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.116 utt2	and they decide, make it Iraqis and Americans, you know,
sd	B.116 utt3	and they just change the title and reshot a few parts, you know, yeah, you know, where they could.
sv	B.116 utt4	I guess they figured we can't tell the difference between an,
bf	A.117 utt1	Actual names, will not be used.
b	B.118 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.120 utt1	Right.
sv	A.123 utt1	Eventually I'm sure they will come out with the, the, the proper names.
b	B.124 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.126 utt1	Right .
sv	B.126 utt2	It was such a,
sv	B.126 utt4	I guess they'll probably come out with a lot of movies, you know.
sv	B.126 utt5	it was such a rout though, you know.
h	B.126 utt6	I don't know, you know,
sd	B.126 utt7	they probably do the story of someone who was shot down early in the war or something and how he survived or, or about, or about those two newsmen or whatever that got captured.
^2	A.127 utt1	Latest story,
b	A.129 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.129 utt2	Kevin Costner I understand is supposed to be play Schwartzkopf, supposedly.
qy	B.130 utt1	Is that right?
no	A.131 utt1	I don't know.
sd	A.133 utt1	That's just one of the many rumors that floats around.
b	B.134 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.135 utt1	Or what you read.
b	B.136 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.136 utt2	Well, I think we've probably,
^2^t	@A.137 utt1	Pretty much used up the tape, I guess.
aa	B.138 utt1	Yeah,
aa^r	B.138 utt2	yeah,
sd^t	B.138 utt3	it's been about five minutes.
fc	B.138 utt4	It's been nice talking with you.
fc	A.139 utt1	Same.
fc	A.139 utt2	And, we'll Talk to you on the next go around.
ad	B.140 utt1	Keep on watching those movies,
fc	B.142 utt1	Okay.
fc	B.142 utt2	Bye bye.
fc	A.143 utt1	Adios.
