sd	A.2 utt1	around here we have a program where, we put out the, the, we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers.
sd	A.2 utt2	And we keep the newspapers in a,
sd	A.2 utt3	they're collected twice a month and the trash and this bottled stuff that is put in a little blue bin that's picked up and sorted out into a truck.
sd	A.2 utt4	So they actually have about three passes at this collection. One for the regular trash, one for the, you know, the bottles and cans and one for the newspapers.
bf	B.5 utt1	But I gather you do not separate, the bottles and cans.
aa	A.6 utt1	No,
sd	A.6 utt2	they do that on the truck.
b	B.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.8 utt1	They separate them as they, you know, dump them.
sd	A.8 utt2	And, you know, one guy comes around with his truck and dumps it all in there.
sd	A.8 utt3	And I think they're running out of, you know, .
sd	A.8 utt4	The sanitary landfill, I think, is, you know, running out.
sv	A.8 utt5	Of course, you being from New Mexico, you've probably been to Washington. Especially if you're, your present location.
aa	B.9 utt1	Yes.
qy^d	A.10 utt1	You must have come to Washington at least once.
ny	B.11 utt1	Yes,
sd^e	B.11 utt2	I know.
sd	B.11 utt3	Not only have I come to Washington but, I find it very amusing that, the thing that was just instituted here is very similar.
sd	B.11 utt4	That is we also have blue bins.
sd	B.11 utt5	We also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck and, landfill space is, in deed, the driving factor here.
sd	B.11 utt6	And, in fact, despite all of our open space out here, landfill space is still, very hard to come by.
sv	A.12 utt1	My, you've got a, a lot of nothing out there. You know,
sv	A.14 utt3	I mean there's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could use for landfill. .
b	B.15 utt1	Ah,
sv	B.15 utt2	but if somebody can make a regulation about it, they will.
qw	A.16 utt1	Well we , we , what, what unique things you think, that you can do about it in what, in Los Alamos?
sd@	A.18 utt1	other than nuking it. / *" of A.16 since it's not a clause or an answer to a question.
b	B.19 utt1	Yes,
b^m	B.19 utt2	other than nuking it.
sd	B.21 utt1	in fact, Los Alamos, has, done a fair amount of research, in recycling things in general.
sd	B.21 utt2	it involves, for instance, creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium, and barium and, other things from, waste material in general. and purify the waste of specific, nasty elements.
sv	A.22 utt1	Well, that's a, that's pretty, upscale, trash, situation.
sv	A.22 utt2	I don't think anybody around here would understand all the, all those exotic techniques, you know, getting rid of the heavy metals.
sd	B.25 utt1	And the thing that just was in the local news bulletin was, somebody ter , made some special, polymers that have the ability to, make certain actinide elements adhere to them.
sd	B.27 utt2	they've, looked at, plutonium and uranium and, some other similar things to try to remove those from radio active waste
sd	B.29 utt2	and, again, this is driven by all of the documentation and, E S and H, considerations that, people are, worrying about, I think, much more than they should.
sd	B.29 utt3	Actually I've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable.
sd	B.31 utt2	Back when I was in graduate school, I did all of the recycling of the, paper from the computer center
sd	B.31 utt3	and, in fact I think I was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recycled paper.
sv	A.34 utt1	Well that's certainly, you know, getting into the swim of things.
sv(^q)	A.34 utt2	I think i , it should go to the heart of the matter though and say, okay guy,
^q	A.34 utt3	y , everybody gets, you know, five pounds of garbage that they can throw away, you know.
^q	A.34 utt4	but more than that every week, you've got to pay by the pound.
sv	A.34 utt5	I think I think would get very, you know, they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff.
sv	B.35 utt1	I think that's a wonderful idea.
sv	B.37 utt1	The only alternative I would see is, and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody's garbage would be a real pain. if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would, speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill
b	A.38 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.39 utt2	and it would also cause people to compact their garbage more.
b	A.40 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.42 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.43 utt1	and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight.
sv	A.44 utt1	Well, of course, you know, those big trucks can, probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor.
