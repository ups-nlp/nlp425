o	A.1 utt1	All right.
qy	B.2 utt1	Have you ever been drug tested?
nd	A.3 utt1	that's a good question.
sd	A.3 utt2	 I had a job I had to go get a blood test for.
b	B.6 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.9 utt1	and they did a full blood screen on me,
sd	A.9 utt2	but they didn't call that a drug test.
sd	A.9 utt4	I think they checked for drugs.
sd	A.9 utt5	They just don't tell you they did.
b	B.10 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.12 utt1	I've had, two or three drug tests that I had to get before I could start working at a job different jobs.
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.14 utt2	I had one at T I and then one at another engineering company.
sd	B.14 utt3	And, really, I mean, I don't mind them.
sd	B.14 utt4	I don't do drugs anyway.
sd	B.14 utt5	I guess if I did, maybe I would
h	B.14 utt6	but, I don't know.
sd	B.14 utt7	I know a girl that, she's a nurse,
sd	B.14 utt8	and they get drug tested randomly.
sd	B.14 utt9	I've, never been randomly drug tested.
b	A.15 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.16 utt2	But that would probably bother me to wake up one day and find out halfway through the day that you're going to be drug tested and you didn't know about it.
b	A.17 utt1	Yeah .
sv	A.17 utt2	Well, I guess it depends on if you got something to worry about .
aa	B.18 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.18 utt2	I guess so.
sv^r	B.18 utt3	I guess so .
qy	B.18 utt4	Do you think that it's right?
nd	A.19 utt1	Well, I, I come from kind of a biased opinion because I'm a therapist and a drug and alcohol counselor.
b	B.20 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.21 utt1	And I've done employee assistant work
sd	A.21 utt2	and I know the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents, on the job that are specifically drug and alcohol related,
b	B.22 utt1	Right.
b	B.24 utt1	Right.
sd	A.25 utt1	and it's like in the billions of dollars every year.
sd	A.25 utt2	and the only way that they can prevent that is, you know, making sure that the employees are drug and alcohol free.
aa	B.26 utt1	That's true.
sv	A.27 utt1	And, you know, the problem in the work place is that people are,
sv	A.27 utt2	like if your boss is your drinking buddy or whatever, I mean, you can come to work drunk and get in an accident
sv	A.27 utt3	and he'll cover up for you
sv	A.27 utt4	and, nobody knows about it,
b	B.28 utt1	Right.
sd	A.29 utt2	but you know, ends up costing the company lots and lots of money.
aa	B.30 utt1	That's true.
sv	B.32 utt1	I believe, it's right, especially for certain jobs.
sv	B.36 utt2	I think anyone in a public job like bus drivers, and cab drivers, and police officers, and things like that,
b	A.37 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.38 utt2	I think they should be randomly drug tested.
b	A.39 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.40 utt2	I believe, full force in that.
b	A.41 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.42 utt2	I don't know that I believe every secretary in every company needs to be.
aa	A.43 utt1	True.
sv	B.44 utt1	You know, secretaries aren't really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something.
h	B.44 utt2	So, I don't know.
sd	B.44 utt3	I'm kind of biased, too, because I don't do drugs
sd	B.44 utt4	and, so, } I really don't care one way or another if anybody wants to pull me up tomorrow and test me. Because I have nothing to worry about.
b	A.45 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.47 utt1	Yeah.
sd^r	B.48 utt2	So, I guess that's kind of biased.
b	A.49 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.49 utt3	it's, I think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job if somebody else is impaired.
aa	B.50 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.50 utt2	It does.
sv	A.51 utt2	Because, generally you know it.
sv	A.51 utt3	you find out one way or another if somebody's got a problem on the job.
aa	B.52 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.52 utt2	That's true.
sv	A.53 utt1	And even if, like you say, even if it's just the secretary,
sv	A.53 utt2	if her work or abilities start affecting her co workers then it's still a problem.
b	B.54 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.56 utt1	That's true.
qw	B.58 utt1	But, what do you do about, the occasional user that may have gone to a party three days before
sd	B.60 utt2	and, you know, it's been the whole weekend since they've done anything
sd	B.60 utt3	and they happen to be tested Monday morning
qy^d	B.60 utt4	and they could be fired for that?
sv	B.60 utt5	You know, that's kind of unfair, also.
aa	A.61 utt1	Well, yeah .
sv	A.61 utt2	I guess it comes with the turf.
aa	B.62 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.62 utt2	I guess so.
sv	B.62 utt3	I guess if you're going to do it you need to suffer the consequences .
b	A.63 utt1	Yeah.
fe	A.63 utt2	Man.
sd	A.63 utt3	And, in terms of drugs, they're illegal.
sd	A.63 utt4	So you're, you're breaking the law anyway.
aa	B.64 utt1	That's true.
aa	B.66 utt1	That's true.
sv	A.67 utt1	Probably the biggest problem with those is they don't do a real good job of assessing for alcohol.
aa	B.68 utt1	That's true.
sv	A.69 utt1	And that's probably the biggest problem there is .
aa	B.70 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.70 utt2	I think so, more than drugs .
sd	B.70 utt3	And I know a lot of companies that will put you in an alcohol rehabilitation before they would put you in a drug rehab.
b	A.71 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.72 utt1	They would pay for an alcohol
b	A.73 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.74 utt1	but they don't always pay for drug rehabilitation.
sv	A.75 utt1	Well, I guess that's one of the positive things that have come out of it, some of the employee assistance program.
sd	A.75 utt2	If you do test positive for something they will give you an o , opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose you're job. / * you're > your
b	B.76 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.78 utt1	That's true.
sv	B.80 utt1	I, think that's fair.
aa	A.83 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.83 utt2	I think the company benefits in the long run.
aa	B.84 utt1	Yeah .
aa	B.84 utt2	That's true .
sd^t	B.84 utt3	That's about all I have, to say on it .
qw	A.87 utt1	what kind of testing do they do when you went?
sd	B.88 utt1	it's a urine test.
b^m	A.89 utt1	Urine screen.
b	A.91 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.92 utt2	it was really very official.
sd	B.92 utt3	You have to go in a room solely by yourself, sign papers that say you were totally alone, sign papers that say this is yours,
sd	B.94 utt1	and you have to seal the bottle yourself and label it yourself and, all of that.
b	A.95 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.96 utt2	So that they're sure that you haven't borrowed anybody's, I guess, or something.
sd	A.97 utt1	Well, that happens.
aa	B.98 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.98 utt2	I know,
sv	B.100 utt1	it's hard to believe,
sd	A.101 utt1	It happens a lot.
sv	B.102 utt1	but I guess it does .
sd	A.103 utt1	there are people that pay other people to , to help them out.
aa	B.104 utt1	I know.
sd	B.104 utt2	I'm amazed, at the things people, will do.
b	A.109 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.110 utt1	It is amazing.
sd	B.110 utt2	I guess there are people that do that.
sv	B.110 utt3	And those are expensive tests.
sd	B.110 utt4	I'm, glad I never had to pay for one.
b	A.111 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.113 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.113 utt2	It depends r , really on how strong a test it is.
sd	A.113 utt3	They've got different degrees, as far as how far back they can check.
aa	B.114 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.114 utt2	I guess so.
sd	A.115 utt2	They got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests.
sd	A.115 utt3	They've some companies that are doing, hair tests.
bh	B.116 utt1	really?
ny	A.117 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.117 utt3	they'll pull out one of your hairs
sd	A.117 utt4	and they can apparently test, back a certain period of time. Because some of the residue ends up in your hair follicles, you know,
ba	B.118 utt1	How weird.
sd	B.118 utt2	I didn't know that.
ba	B.120 utt1	that's weird.
sd	A.121 utt1	Hair follicles, I guess, are just dead protein
b	B.122 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.123 utt1	And it's apparently almost like a calendar.
sd	A.123 utt2	they've got it pretty precise now.
sd	A.123 utt3	They can go back and look at, in terms of growth in a hair, when you used and that type of thing.
ba	B.124 utt1	That's wild.
sv	B.126 utt1	It's amazing the things they can find out from different things on your body.
aa	A.127 utt1	Yeah .
sv	A.127 utt2	So, I guess if they perfect that is not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give blood or something like that.
aa	B.128 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.128 utt2	That's true .
aa	B.130 utt1	That's true.
sd	B.130 utt2	I'm glad I never had to do it by giving blood.
sd	B.130 utt3	I can't stand the thought of giving blood.
b	A.131 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.132 utt1	I can't even do it for Wadley, even though it's a good cause .
b	A.133 utt1	Yeah.
fc	B.134 utt1	Well, I enjoyed talking to you.
fc	A.135 utt1	Well, I did, too.
ft	B.136 utt1	Thank you.
fc	A.137 utt1	Uh huh.
fc	B.138 utt1	Bye bye.
fc	A.139 utt1	Bye bye.
