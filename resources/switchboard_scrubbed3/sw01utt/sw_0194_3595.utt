o	A.1 utt1	Arlington, Texas
sd^t	A.1 utt2	now since I got somebody from Arlington, Virginia one day .
bh	B.2 utt1	Is that right? .
ny	A.3 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.4 utt1	Well, I never thought about that,
sd	B.4 utt2	but there is an Arlington,
sd^t	B.4 utt3	like I had a call the other day from Birmingham, Michigan you know,
b	A.5 utt1	Oh
sd	B.6 utt2	and I was thinking yeah, and I was thinking
b^m	A.7 utt1	Birmingham.
sd	B.8 utt2	the only Birmingham I could think of was Alabama.
aa	A.9 utt1	Right.
sv	A.9 utt2	It's funny how many names have been used, all over the country.
aa	B.10 utt1	Yeah,
qw	B.10 utt2	well, tell me what kind of books have you read?
sd	A.11 utt1	Well, to tell you the truth, I've been going to college for the last four years
sd	A.11 utt2	so mainly, text books.
qy^g	B.14 utt1	I was going to say, not fun kind, right?
nn	A.15 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.15 utt2	but, I really tend to like biographies a lot, not necessarily always heavy ones
b	B.16 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.17 utt1	but, you know, sometimes biogr ,
sd	A.17 utt2	I just read one about Grace Kelley.
sd	A.17 utt3	I love to read about real people.
sd	A.17 utt4	To me, half the time it's more fascinating than some of these made up stories .
aa	B.18 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.18 utt2	it is,
sd	B.18 utt3	because you know it's really and truly a true thing.
aa	A.19 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.19 utt2	it happened.
sd	B.20 utt2	You know, I read one about Bob Hope that I liked.
bh	A.21 utt1	Really?
ny	B.22 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.22 utt2	that was real good.
sd	B.22 utt3	I'm like you,
sd	B.22 utt4	if it's not a heavy biography, you know I enjoy it.
b	A.23 utt1	Right.
sd	A.25 utt1	I used to like to read about royalty a lot.
sd	A.25 utt2	when I was younger I read about every king and queen that lived, I think, in Europe.
sd	A.25 utt3	That was my thing for a while.
^h	B.26 utt1	I was trying to think,
sd	B.26 utt2	I read a novel that used the names of like Princess Di and Prince Phillip coming over here to be entertained and all,
sd	B.26 utt3	and there was a murder.
bh	A.27 utt1	really.
ny	B.28 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.28 utt2	it was some time ago.
sd	B.28 utt3	Seems like it was THE SPY WENT DANCING, or something like that.
ba	A.29 utt1	it sounds like fun.
sd	B.30 utt1	It was a lot of fun because they used these real names, you know.
sd	A.31 utt1	Wonder if it was by one of those famous writers, you know
sd	A.31 utt2	Margaret Truman Daniels writes a lot those.
aa	B.32 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.32 utt2	in fact I believe it was
bh	A.33 utt1	Really?
ny	B.34 utt1	Uh huh.
sd^e	B.34 utt2	I believe.
sv	A.35 utt1	Sounds like something she would write.
aa	B.36 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.36 utt2	I think it was by her, now that you mention it, because someone had given it to me,
sd(^q)	B.36 utt3	and I thought, well, this will be great,
sd	B.36 utt4	and it was.
b	A.37 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.37 utt2	I've heard that you know, her books are really interesting,
sd	A.37 utt3	and they always sell well.
b	B.38 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.40 utt1	Well, when you use real people like that, I think royalty, especially, you know.
aa	A.41 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.41 utt2	brings it to life.
sd	A.43 utt1	I know, some of the British people laugh at us because we're so enthralled with their royalty.
aa	B.44 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.44 utt2	but you know, that's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth, you know.
aa	A.45 utt1	I know,
sv	A.45 utt2	our movie stars.
b^m	B.46 utt1	Our movie stars,
sv	B.46 utt2	because it's totally different concept to us.
aa	A.47 utt1	right.
sd	B.48 utt1	I haven't had a chance to read a lot lately either.
sd	B.48 utt2	I have read, mostly novels.
sd	B.48 utt3	I went to visit my daughter in Florida
sd	B.50 utt1	and I took a novel with me, and read it at Thanksgiving time,
sd	B.50 utt2	and, it was, one of those generation novels, you know
aa	A.51 utt1	yes.
sd	B.52 utt1	starts out when they're small and continues through generations
sd	A.53 utt1	I always like those.
sd	B.54 utt1	and I like that.
qy	A.55 utt1	Have you ever read anything by Susan Howatch?
ny	B.56 utt1	Yes,
sd^e	B.56 utt2	I have.
qy	A.57 utt1	Isn't she fabulous?
na	B.58 utt1	she is wonderful.
sd	A.59 utt1	once you st ,
sd	A.59 utt2	I don't like to get one of her books
sd	A.59 utt3	because, I just live to read.
sd	A.61 utt2	I'll skip everything just to get back to the book .
sd	B.62 utt1	I stayed up one night, I think until two in the morning finishing one of hers because I could not put it down.
ba	A.63 utt1	yeah.
sv	A.65 utt1	She's just a,
h	A.65 utt2	I don't know,
qw	A.65 utt3	how often does she come out with them.
sd	A.65 utt4	I probably have missed the last few since I've been back in school.
ar	B.66 utt1	Well, no,
sd	B.66 utt2	it seems like she doesn't write as often as, well, like Danielle Steele and those silly things.
sv	B.66 utt3	She writes the same thing.
sv	A.67 utt1	Well, she can turn them out overnight, I swear.
aa	B.68 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.68 utt2	and they're the same silly things,
sv	B.68 utt3	I mean, if you've read one, I mean it's, It, it's practically the same thing over and over, you know.
aa	A.69 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.69 utt2	I've never read a whole one of hers, I don't think.
ad	A.71 utt1	And think how rich she is.
aa	B.72 utt1	Yeah,
qh	B.72 utt2	wouldn't I, you know,
sd	B.72 utt3	I'm criticizing her,
qh	B.72 utt4	and wouldn't I like to have her money
aa	A.73 utt1	yeah.
sd	B.74 utt1	because they go from hardback to paperback
sd	B.74 utt2	and she has millions of them.
sd	A.75 utt1	And then make movies out of some of them.
b	B.76 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.76 utt2	You know, mini series and so forth,
sd	B.76 utt3	and it seems to me like Susan Howatch does not write as often.
sd	B.76 utt4	I have not seen as many of hers.
sv	A.77 utt1	Well, hers are so involved,
sv	A.77 utt2	and they're so such a higher intellectual level, because she quotes a lot, you know.
b	B.78 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.80 utt1	I think she does a lot of research, too.
aa	A.81 utt1	I do too,
sv	A.81 utt2	so she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers,
aa	B.82 utt1	Huh uh.
sv	A.83 utt2	but her books are just incredible.
qy^g	A.83 utt3	I don't think they've ever made a movie, do you?
nn	B.84 utt1	No,
sd^e	B.84 utt2	I don't think so,
qy^g	B.84 utt3	and I've often wondered why, haven't you?
ny	A.85 utt1	Yes
ar	A.87 utt1	well, no,
sd	A.87 utt2	I really just thought about it now
b	B.88 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.89 utt1	Maybe it's because they take so much in.
h	A.89 utt2	I don't know.
b	B.90 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.90 utt2	Maybe they're just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them, you know.
sv	A.91 utt1	They're so big
b	B.92 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.93 utt1	they're such, you know,
sv	A.93 utt2	it would be like another GONE WITH THE WIND, I guess another three hour movie .
b	B.94 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.96 utt1	And maybe that turns people off,
ad	B.96 utt2	but look at GONE WITH THE WIND, you know.
aa	A.97 utt1	I know.
sd	A.97 utt2	It's about one of my favorite movies.
qy	B.98 utt1	have you, gotten into SCARLETT yet?
nn	A.99 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.99 utt2	it had such a bad press,
sd	A.99 utt3	I wasn't too .
aa	B.100 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.100 utt2	that's exactly what I was going to say.
sd	B.100 utt3	I was amazed,
sd	B.100 utt5	in the beginning when it was you know, on route coming out I heard mixed publicity kind of good and bad,
b	A.101 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.103 utt1	Right.
sd	B.104 utt2	and then when it came out, all I heard was just, how bad it was, that I didn't even want to get it.
aa	A.105 utt1	Me, either.
qy	A.105 utt2	Do you know anyone that's read it?
nn	B.106 utt1	Huh uh.
aa	A.107 utt1	No,
sd	A.107 utt2	I haven't heard of anybody that's read it, either.
b	B.108 utt1	No.
sd	A.109 utt1	I think it was on the best seller list, though for a while.
sd	B.110 utt1	Well it wouldn't surprise me,
