o	B.1 utt1	Lucille Hughes.
b	A.2 utt1	Okay,
sd	A.2 utt2	Lucille, I'm on .
b	B.3 utt1	All right,
sd^t	A.4 utt1	And okay, our topic was,
qy^t	A.4 utt2	did you hear our topic?
ny	B.5 utt1	Yes.
aa	A.6 utt1	All right,
sd^t	A.6 utt2	basketball.
b	B.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.8 utt1	I guess I'm probably a lot like you.
sd	A.8 utt2	I'm a Dallas Maverick fan.
sd	B.9 utt1	Well, I certainly am too.
ad	B.9 utt2	Now tell me what you expect from the Mavericks this year.
sd	A.10 utt1	Well, unfortunately, I don't expect a great deal out of them.
sv	A.10 utt2	They just have too many problems, too many ailments, too many hurt bones, and maybe too much age at this point.
sv	A.10 utt3	You know, when Roy Tarpley just now he messed up on them, it just hurt them so bad.
sd	A.10 utt4	I feel like everyone else,
sd	A.12 utt2	I feel sorry for Donald Carter and the members of the team and the management team and everyone else.
sv	A.12 utt3	It just seems like they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possibly be a final team playing for all of it.
aa	B.13 utt1	Yes, sir.
sd	A.14 utt1	National championship or the world championship, and something like this happens.
b	B.15 utt1	Oh.
qy	B.15 utt2	Well, do you think it's time that we go for new, coaches?
qy	B.15 utt3	Is that part of our problem?
ny	A.16 utt1	Yeah,
sv^e	A.16 utt2	I think at this time, we're just in a rebuilding type of phase, you know.
sv	A.16 utt3	I think that probably be evident with the more and more young guys they draft.
sv	B.17 utt1	Well, it just, it's so discouraging that they can't really,
sv	B.17 utt2	I mean, they're entitled to more than they've been able to do so far.
sd	B.17 utt3	I'm awfully sorry that the Mavericks can't come on and do.
qw	B.17 utt4	Roy, who's your next best team,
qw	B.17 utt5	or who do you like after the Mavericks?
fe	A.18 utt1	gosh,
sd	A.18 utt2	I'm so much a Maverick fan I don't know.
sd	A.18 utt3	Probably the Boston Celtics.
sd	A.18 utt4	I've just always like the Boston Celtics.
sv	A.18 utt5	they have a similar situation in that a lot of old guys on the team,
sv	A.18 utt6	and, but they're still playing good ball.
sd	A.20 utt1	But I've always been a Boston Celtic fan, too,
sd	A.20 utt2	but, you know, I've lived in Texas since seventy four,
sd	A.20 utt3	so being a transplanted Texan in the Dallas area, I have to stick with those Dallas Mavericks.
sv	B.21 utt1	We certainly need to support them,
^g	B.21 utt2	do we not.
ny	A.22 utt1	Yes,
sd^e	A.22 utt2	we do. You know.
qy	B.23 utt1	Do you go to the game?
ny	A.24 utt1	Yes,
sd^e	A.24 utt2	I go to a few games.
sd	A.24 utt3	I haven't been to many.
sd	A.24 utt4	I'm not a season ticket holder or anything.
sd	A.24 utt5	I was a season ticket holder of the Cowboys for years,
sd	A.24 utt6	and when my kids got to a certain age and went off to school and college and doing their own thing, sort of gets boring going by yourself .
aa	B.25 utt1	Yes,
sv	B.25 utt2	it does .
sv	B.25 utt3	I'm sure it would in such a monstrous place down there.
aa	A.26 utt1	you bet.
sv	B.27 utt1	But, maybe they can do some.
h	B.27 utt2	I don't know,
qw	B.27 utt3	who do they need to trade?
no	A.28 utt1	Well, I don't know.
sv	A.28 utt2	It seems like Rolando Blackman and Harper sort of carry the team,
h	A.28 utt4	I don't know,
sv	A.28 utt5	I'm afraid to say, that's probably who they need to trade to get someone in there good,
sv	A.28 utt6	but, and that can really help the team,
sv	A.28 utt7	but they do that,
sv	A.28 utt8	they trade the nucleus of their power right now.
aa	B.29 utt1	Yes, sir,
sd	B.29 utt2	it seems that way to me.
sd	B.29 utt3	course I don't know any of the newer ones that they have
sd	B.29 utt4	and I'm not well versed on their capabilities,
sv	B.29 utt5	but we really need to do something.
sd	A.30 utt1	Well, you know, I feel like, the best they can hope for this year is probably an opportunity to make the playoffs.
sd	A.30 utt2	I like their coach.
sd	A.30 utt3	I really like a lot,
sv	A.30 utt4	and I think he deserves a good break.
sv	A.30 utt5	I think he deserves a healthy team so they can really see what he can do for the club.
sv	A.30 utt6	Donald Carter, the owner, I think with all he's invested, he deserves a a healthy team for one year and a good break also.
ba	B.33 utt1	Yes, sir.
sv	A.34 utt1	This thing with Roy Tarpley just upset everyone, I think. Fans, owners, management, everyone.
sv	B.35 utt1	And they have just done as much as they can for that man,
sd	B.35 utt2	and he apparently can't straighten his act out,
sv	B.35 utt3	so we need to build on something more positive than that.
aa	A.36 utt1	You bet.
sv	A.36 utt2	I think they're fools if they ever bring him back .
aa	B.37 utt1	I do, too.
sd	B.37 utt2	I certainly would agree to that.
sd	A.38 utt1	Hate to put it that way.
sd	A.38 utt2	I just would not believe him any more.
sv	B.39 utt2	I mean, you can't give, anyone too many chances
aa	A.40 utt1	No.
sv	B.41 utt1	and I think he has gone over the limit.
sd(^q)	A.42 utt1	There's an old saying you can lead a horse to water
^q	A.42 utt2	but you can't make him drink.
aa	B.43 utt1	That's right.
sv	A.44 utt1	And I think Tarpley's just a sad case.
sv	A.46 utt1	But to be making a million dollars a year, that's pretty sad.
aa	B.47 utt1	It is tragic.
sv	B.47 utt3	I mean, we're going to have to do something about all of these fabulous salaries they're paying to all of our athletes, I think.
aa	A.48 utt1	I think you're right.
sv	A.48 utt2	Everything has been put out of perspective now.
sd	A.48 utt3	You know, you take a young kid Roy Tarpley's age, I'd say he was twenty one when he came into the league,
sd	A.48 utt4	and now he's probably an old age of, twenty five or six and making all that money,
ba	B.49 utt1	Yes, sir.
sv	A.50 utt2	well, that's quite a, that's a little more of a challenge for a young man than they need at that point in their life, I think.
aa	B.51 utt1	I think you're right.
sd	B.51 utt2	I believe that one,
sv	A.52 utt1	I think, you know, it's created by,
