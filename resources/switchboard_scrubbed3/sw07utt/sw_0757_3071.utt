qrr	A.13 utt4	or have you studied?
ny	B.14 utt1	yeah.
b	A.15 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.16 utt1	A long time out, all through college and everything I was in the choirs.
b	A.17 utt1	Right.
sd	B.18 utt1	And I've had some classical vocal training.
bh	A.19 utt1	really?
ny	B.20 utt1	Uh huh.
ba	A.21 utt1	great.
qr	A.21 utt2	did you do that in, Texas, or somewhere else?
nn	B.22 utt1	No,
sd^e	B.22 utt2	I was in Europe.
b	A.23 utt1	Oh.
qw	A.23 utt2	Whereabouts?
sd	B.24 utt1	in Germany.
b	A.25 utt1	Uh huh.
ba	A.25 utt2	that's wonderful.
sd	A.25 utt3	well, I likewise sang in high school and in college in choirs,
sd	A.25 utt4	and then I didn't sing in a choral group, until after I was, married,
sd	A.25 utt5	and I sang in a couple of, community choirs, and then waited for a while,
sd	A.25 utt6	and now for about the last eight years I've sung in a church choir here, in Texas.
b	B.26 utt1	yeah.
sd	A.27 utt2	And, so I enjoy, just the chorals singing a lot, as well.
b	B.30 utt1	Uh huh.
qr	A.31 utt2	are you a soprano, alto, or,
sd	B.32 utt1	Soprano.
b^m	A.33 utt1	A soprano.
sd	A.33 utt2	Yeah, so am I.
qy	A.33 utt3	Do you,
qw	A.33 utt4	and, what kind of music do you like to sing?
sd	A.33 utt5	you were saying you had classical training.
qr	A.33 utt6	Do you have a particular composer that you like or, a particular type ?
sd	B.36 utt1	as far as opera goes, I'm, I think most fond of Verdi.
b	A.37 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.39 utt1	I've been listening to, some advertisements for MADAM BUTTERFLY,
sd	A.39 utt2	and I'm wondering if you have ever done anything like that,
qy	A.39 utt3	have you ever done any, if, if you had done MADAM BUTTERFLY.
nn	B.40 utt1	No,
nn^r	B.40 utt2	no,
sd	B.42 utt1	I haven't done,
sd	B.42 utt2	I'd love to,
b	A.43 utt1	Yes.
sd	B.44 utt1	but, that's, Puccini, I think,
^g	B.44 utt2	right?
ny	A.45 utt1	Uh huh,
ny	A.45 utt2	yes,
ny^r	A.45 utt3	uh huh.
sd	A.45 utt4	MADAM BUTTERFLY was, in Dallas,
sd	A.47 utt2	it's been two or three years ago now,
sd	A.47 utt3	and then I went to see that,
sd	A.47 utt4	and, it was really wonderful.
b	B.48 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.49 utt2	It was particularly well,
sd	A.49 utt3	the acting was particularly nice, I thought,
sd	A.49 utt4	and, so, it was quite popular.
b	B.50 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.51 utt2	you don't play, an instrument
qy	A.51 utt3	so, have you ever wanted to, like guitar or piano or ,
aa@	B.52 utt1	No. I think it would be nice if I played the piano.
aa	A.55 utt1	Yeah,
aa	A.55 utt2	yeah.
sv	A.55 utt3	I think that's always a good instrument for anybody who sings or does, you know, some other kind of instrument,
sv	A.55 utt4	I think piano is always good background,
b	B.56 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.57 utt2	I played piano well, I guess from the time I was five until I graduated from college,
sd	A.57 utt3	and, then I was a piano teacher for a while while my husband was in graduate school,
sd	A.57 utt4	so, that was the instrument both of my children started on,
sd	A.57 utt5	but neither of them stayed with it .
b	B.58 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.59 utt1	One of them, turned into a violist,
sd	A.59 utt2	and the other one the boy is, guitar and percussion,
b	B.60 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.61 utt2	I think that the piano background is very, useful,
sv	A.61 utt3	and, I'm sure that for you, it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself, just for practicing and so on.
aa	B.62 utt1	yeah.
b	A.65 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.65 utt2	Do you have any other kind of music that you like?
sd	B.66 utt1	I like to listen to all different kinds of music.
b	A.67 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.67 utt3	I used to work with a fellow who had,
sd	A.67 utt4	although this was a computer company, he had his, P H D in musical, I guess it was in composition, actually, from University of North Texas,
sd	A.67 utt5	and, yet when I would go into his, his office every now and then, you never knew what kind of music he'd be playing on the radio .
sd	A.69 utt2	It may be country,
sd	A.69 utt3	it might be classical,
sd	A.69 utt4	it might be rock, you know
b	B.70 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.71 utt1	it was just, he said that just about what you said, that he just liked all kinds of music.
b	B.72 utt1	Yeah
sd	A.73 utt1	And that was neat for me to hear that somebody is,
sd	B.74 utt1	There's, you know, some of the really totally country stuff, I don't really particularly like
b	A.75 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.75 utt2	yeah.
qy	A.75 utt3	do you have any plans to, do anything with your music in the near future
sd	B.76 utt1	Well, I have like, we,
sd	B.76 utt2	I wish I could
b	A.77 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.78 utt1	but I don't really know how to go about it without having a degree
b	A.79 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.81 utt1	I know that there are, if you're interested in choral singing,
sd	A.81 utt2	I'm not sure where, you are in Texas,
sd	A.83 utt2	but I do know that some communities have, community choruses
sv	A.85 utt2	and, that's often a good way to get back into it again.
b	B.86 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.87 utt2	it's not terribly demanding.
sd	A.87 utt3	You might have to audition,
sv	A.87 utt4	but that probably wouldn't be a problem,
sd	A.87 utt5	but, there usually, you know,
sd	A.87 utt6	that they take tours and things like that
sd	A.87 utt7	and you get to know you know, people socially as well as in a musical setting,
b	B.88 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.89 utt2	so that's always fun.
b	B.90 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.91 utt2	I think well, that's one reason why I have enjoyed my choir so much, is that not only do we sing wonderful music,
sd	A.91 utt3	but we've gotten to know each other quite well, on a social level,
sd	A.91 utt4	and, and I think we sing better because of that.
b	B.92 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.93 utt2	I think, you know, I think we sing more like, people who trust each other , which is really nice.
ba	B.94 utt1	That's good.
b	B.96 utt1	Uh huh,
b	B.96 utt2	yeah.
qw	A.97 utt2	So, whereabouts in, Texas are you, if I could ask?
sd	B.100 utt1	I'm in Flower Mound.
b^m	A.101 utt1	Flower Mound,
bk	A.101 utt2	okay.
b	B.102 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.103 utt1	Well, I'm in Plano,
sd	A.103 utt2	so, we're just not too far apart, actually.
aa	B.104 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.104 utt2	that's pretty close.
b	A.105 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.105 utt2	It was funny,
sd	A.105 utt4	I talk to people all over, Texas, of the state,
sd	A.105 utt5	so I'm always asking where in the state, you know, the person is from if they're in Texas.
b	B.106 utt1	Yeah.
qy	A.107 utt1	do you have a family?
na	B.108 utt1	I'm married.
b	A.109 utt1	Uh huh.
qy^d	A.109 utt2	I was wondering if your spouse,
qrr	A.109 utt3	or you know, if you had, other musical people in your family.
br	B.110 utt1	I'm sorry?
qy^d	A.111 utt1	if you have other people in your family who are also musical.
na	B.112 utt1	a little bit.
b	A.113 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.115 utt1	Do you come by it naturally?
qy	A.115 utt2	were your parents that musical?
ny	B.116 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.116 utt2	I think so.
b	A.117 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.117 utt2	yeah.
sv	A.117 utt3	That often is the case,
sv	A.117 utt5	it, sometimes it will skip.
sd	A.117 utt6	Like my husband is not musical at all,
sd	A.117 utt7	but his mother is very musical,
sd	A.117 utt8	and his children are very musical,
sv	A.117 utt9	so you never know where the talent is going to show up, I guess, sometimes.
sd^t	A.117 utt10	So, well, I'm not sure how long we've talked.
sd^t	A.119 utt1	I haven't been paying attention to the clock.
sd^t	A.119 utt2	But, I'll bet we've done at least five minutes.
sd	B.120 utt1	Probably .
fc	A.121 utt1	Well, I've enjoyed talking with you, Becky,
fc	B.122 utt1	Okay.
fc	A.123 utt2	and, maybe we'll talk again.
fc	B.124 utt1	All right,
ft	B.124 utt2	thanks.
fc	A.125 utt1	Uh huh.
fc	A.125 utt2	Bye bye.
fc	B.126 utt1	Bye bye.
