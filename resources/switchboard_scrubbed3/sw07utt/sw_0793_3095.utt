sd^t	A.1 utt1	I guess we are just to discuss trials and punishment. If it's to be given by the judge or not.
qy^t	A.1 utt2	did you catch your explanation of that?
ny	B.2 utt1	Yes,
sd^e	B.2 utt2	I did.
b	A.3 utt1	Okay.
sd	B.4 utt2	maybe I'm a hard liner
sv	B.4 utt3	but I think that there should be some preset penalties in criminal cases. Rather than, degrees of sentencing.
qy	A.5 utt1	You mean the crimes or the punishment should fit the crime?
na	B.6 utt1	Right.
na^r	B.6 utt2	Right.
bk	A.7 utt1	Okay .
sd	B.8 utt1	again, having participated in jury duty myself, I know , I know how such a diverse group of people get together, the different backgrounds, different ideas, that sometimes you can have one person or two, that can hold up what I consider the proper sentencing, of the person.
aa	A.9 utt1	Yes,
sd	A.9 utt2	I did also.
b	A.11 utt1	Right.
ad	A.17 utt1	Could you hang on one minute Jim?
aa	B.18 utt1	Yes ma'am.
ft	A.19 utt1	Thank you .
fa	A.21 utt1	I am so sorry to keep you on hold.
bd	B.22 utt1	No problem.
qy	A.23 utt1	Are you at work?
ny	B.24 utt1	Yes.
bk	A.25 utt1	Okay,
sd	A.25 utt2	I am too.
b	B.26 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.26 utt2	I think what you have is, the way the justice system works is they bend over backwards trying to protect the guilty.
sv	A.27 utt1	it's insane.
sv	B.28 utt1	So many things in their back,
br	B.28 utt2	pardon?
sv^r	A.29 utt1	It's insane.
aa	B.30 utt1	Yes.
sd	B.30 utt2	I know,
sd	B.32 utt1	my wife participated in a jury trial several years back wherein the individual after it was over and they, had came up with the maximum sentence in the jury form they found out that, the gentleman involved had a long history of the same type offense which was theft of property.
b	A.33 utt1	Yes.
b	A.37 utt1	Yes.
b	A.39 utt1	Right.
b	A.41 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.43 utt1	yes.
sd	B.44 utt1	And yet, the attorney, for the prosecution could not enter the good man's background into it.
sd	B.46 utt2	It was like, this was a first time offender.
b	A.49 utt1	Yes.
sv	B.50 utt1	Whereas, I think that's,
sv	A.53 utt1	It seems like ,
sv	B.54 utt1	Those that should be in jail should be in jail .
aa	A.55 utt1	That's correct
sv	A.55 utt2	and there's too much leniency,
sv	A.55 utt3	there's too much, underhanded, things going on that the public are not aware of.
b	B.56 utt1	Yeah
sv	A.57 utt1	And it seems as though we are, giving the criminal the benefit, more than the victim.
sv	A.57 utt2	The victim has been victimized twice, not only by the perpetrator of the crime but also, the courts that try to do the justice.
sv	B.60 utt1	Well, I think this is one of the reasons that also that attorneys have such a, unsavory reputation,
qh	B.60 utt2	shall we say?
sd	A.61 utt1	I don't have an ounce in my body of credibility toward the judicial system in the United States.
b	B.62 utt1	Yeah
sv	B.64 utt1	Well, what you got is the situation wherein, if you ever get in trouble, you want to hire the smartest, crookedest, lawyer you can find.
bh	A.65 utt1	Isn't that terrible?
sv	B.66 utt1	And, that's not the idea.
sv	B.66 utt2	the idea is not to get the guy off of the crime, that he committed, but to punish him for the crime he committed. * slash error Yeah. / * slash error
aap	A.69 utt1	Well, to punish him for the crime but also to try and reeducate the man's thinking.
sv	A.71 utt1	To get him out of that, criminal mind that he has and to direct, him into a more productive life.
b	B.74 utt1	Yeah
sd	B.74 utt3	Well we have, a situation again that I am familiar with where, the son of an acquaintance of mine was killed while trying to stop a robbery.
b	A.75 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.77 utt1	Oh .
b	A.79 utt1	Yes,
ba	A.79 utt2	how sad.
sd	B.80 utt1	And the person that killed him was a young woman who had left the house with full intent to commit crimes, carrying a gun in her purse.
b	A.81 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.82 utt1	And, anyway it'd get to the,
sd	B.82 utt2	she was sentenced to jail
sd	B.82 utt3	but then due to technicalities, she was going to be out of jail within eighteen months after she was sentenced.
b	A.83 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.84 utt1	Of course it took eighteen months for the trial to happen.
b	A.85 utt1	Right.
sd	B.86 utt1	So, then, there was a letter writing campaign that went in,
sd	B.88 utt2	and the Parole Board received approximately a thousand letters protesting putting this person back on the street within eighteen months after killing someone.
sd	B.88 utt3	And, fortunately it worked.
sd	B.88 utt4	they corrected the technicality.
sd	B.90 utt1	And the person now will have to serve three to four years of the seven or eight they were sentenced to.
b	A.91 utt1	Yes.
sv	A.91 utt2	If enough of the public, responded to, the, parties that are involved, and if enough,
sv	A.93 utt2	they will listen to the voice of the people.
sd	A.93 utt3	I have found that out. That if enough people respond and rise up against the injustices being done, something is going to change.
b	B.94 utt1	Right.
sv	A.95 utt1	People have to be involved.
sv	B.96 utt1	This is it
b	A.97 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.98 utt1	and most people don't take the time.
aa	A.99 utt1	That's right.
sd	B.100 utt1	Again the only reason I took the time is because I was personally acquainted with these people.
aa	A.101 utt1	That's right.
sd	B.102 utt2	I'm just as guilty as the rest in that respect.
aa	A.105 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.105 utt2	but, and I'm not making an excuse
sv	A.105 utt3	but our priorities are a bit backward.
aa	B.106 utt1	yes.
sv	B.106 utt2	Well, they, again the,
sd	B.106 utt3	and I'm not knocking the civil rights program or anything like that,
sv	B.106 utt4	but we've gone, overboard to, protect persons from having their civil rights, violated to the point where the person that is damaged, is not protected.
sv	B.112 utt2	It's again the victim gets worse punishment then the person, that commits the crimes.
aa	A.115 utt1	That's correct.
b	B.116 utt1	Yeah
b	A.117 utt1	Yeah.
b^r	A.117 utt2	Yeah.
b	B.118 utt1	Okay.
sv	B.118 utt2	I think we're both in agreement on this subject.
sd	A.119 utt1	Well, I am too.
sd	A.121 utt1	I mean I just can't.
sd	A.121 utt2	you know, I served on a jury for a lady that was having a mental problem
sd	A.121 utt3	and we found her not because the lady obviously was not in their right mind.
sd	A.121 utt4	So if the person is not in the right mind, I mean they had to, put her away.
b	B.122 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.123 utt1	But for her own safety and because she didn't know what she was doing.
sd	A.125 utt1	And we just dismissed the case. You know,
b	B.126 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.127 utt2	and, she was, taken care of by the proper facility.
b	B.128 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.128 utt2	Well another side of the coin with our justice system there are a lot of frivolous cases that go to court.
sv	B.128 utt3	There are a lot of things that could be settled out of court or should never have gone to court.
aa	A.129 utt1	Yes,
aa	A.129 utt2	that's true.
sv	B.130 utt2	And then the amazing thing, of course, is how, some cases can come to trial in thirty days,
sv	B.130 utt3	and others it takes eighteen months .
