o	A.1 utt1	Okay.
sd	A.1 utt2	we keep a monthly budget.
sd	A.1 utt3	I just recently stopped working so I can be home with my kids
sd^r	A.1 utt4	so we keep a monthly budget
sd	A.1 utt5	and we try to stick to it .
aa	B.2 utt1	I know.
sd	B.2 utt2	it's really difficult here. All because there's always something breaking.
sd	B.2 utt3	Car needs tires or you know, something.
aa	A.3 utt1	Yeah,
aa^r	A.3 utt2	yeah.
sv	A.3 utt3	That's the kind of things that throw you off.
sd	B.4 utt1	we do ours more monthly than long range.
sd	B.4 utt3	my husband gets paid once a month
b	A.5 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.6 utt1	and when he gets paid, I pay all the bills.
b	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.8 utt1	And out of his check they take a savings
sd	B.8 utt2	and out of my check, they take savings and retirement out of both checks.
b	A.9 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.11 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.12 utt1	So, as far as extra savings, we really don't have that much extra to save.
b	A.13 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.14 utt1	his check, once a month, pays all the bills.
sd	B.14 utt2	My check, weekly, buys groceries and gas and you know, that kind of thing
ba	A.15 utt1	how nice.
b	A.17 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.18 utt1	and it works out real well that way.
sd	B.18 utt2	We don't run into a lot of problems
b	A.19 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.19 utt2	yeah.
sv	B.20 utt1	but budgets are horrible.
aa	A.21 utt1	Well, I know.
sd	A.23 utt3	my husband gets paid twice a week
sd	A.23 utt4	and so we pay all of the little bills, one paycheck and then like the mortgage and the electric bill, you know, those big bills the second second pay
b	B.24 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.26 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.27 utt2	and then, again, he does have a savings that comes out, you know, for Christmas and stuff, that kind of thing.
b	B.28 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.28 utt2	yeah.
bf(^q)	B.28 utt3	When the car insurance is due and you call the credit union and tell them, well send me some money .
aa	A.29 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.29 utt2	that kind of thing.
aa	B.30 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.30 utt2	it would be nice if we didn't have to touch the money he has taken out and put in savings
sd	B.30 utt3	but we do.
sd	A.31 utt1	But it's nice that it's there, you know.
b	B.32 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.32 utt3	I'm just glad that it is there for car insurance, medical bills, whatever happens .
b	A.33 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.35 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.37 utt1	Yeah.
sd^r	A.37 utt2	It's nice that it's there.
aa	B.38 utt1	I know.
sd	B.38 utt4	it's just really is difficult.
sd	B.38 utt5	neither one of us has had a raise in a couple of years.
b	A.39 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.40 utt1	And, of course, the cost of living keeps going up so much.
b	A.41 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.42 utt1	Groceries are outrageous
sd(^q)	B.42 utt2	and I keep saying my check does less and less
aa	A.43 utt1	Yeah,
aa^r	A.43 utt2	yeah.
sd	A.43 utt3	That's kind of how I felt when I was working because it seemed like we spent more.
b	B.44 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.45 utt1	We bought more things
sd^r	A.45 utt2	and it seemed like we spent more.
sd	A.45 utt3	Then a lot of it was going to, daycare and that kind of thing.
b	B.46 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.47 utt1	So it just seems like with me staying home, we had that big cut
sd	A.47 utt2	but we save more .
sd	A.47 utt3	I don't know how
sd	A.47 utt4	and I don't know why
sd	B.48 utt1	Well I know that since I do work, I buy a lot of quicker cuts of meat and, well the frozen things for the microwave and things like that.
sd	A.49 utt1	it seems like we do.
b	A.51 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.53 utt1	Yeah,
bf	A.53 utt2	you kind of try and buy bigger quantities.
sd	B.54 utt1	And I'll stop by the deli and pick up, chicken or whatever. Where if I did not work, I'm sure that the grocery bill could be managed a lot, better.
aa	A.55 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.55 utt2	That's how I felt too.
bf	A.55 utt4	you could take a little longer. And just watch a little bit more I guess.
b	B.56 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.59 utt1	I guess that's kind of like the way we do.
sd	A.59 utt3	I don't, I don't know how it comes out.
sd	A.59 utt4	It just seems like we save a little bit more whereas, where I was working,
sv	B.62 utt1	Well, I'm sure you do.
sd	B.62 utt2	well I do not have to pay child care during the winter.
sd	B.62 utt3	My son's old enough that he likes to come home from school.
b	A.63 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.64 utt2	But in the summer he's still young enough that I cannot leave him by himself.
b	A.65 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.66 utt1	So in the summer I have that extra
sd	B.66 utt2	and ours is seventy dollars a week plus all activities
b	A.67 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.68 utt1	and that's usually movies one day, skating one day .
b	A.69 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.70 utt1	Swimming one day .
sv	A.71 utt1	It adds up.
aa	B.72 utt1	Yes.
sd	B.72 utt2	So you usually end up paying close to eighty dollars a week
sv	B.72 utt3	and that's a lot of money.
aa	A.73 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.73 utt2	it is .
sv^r	A.73 utt3	It is,
sv	B.74 utt1	But you know, if they're going to be in daycare then they need to have some activities other than just being there.
b	A.75 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	B.76 utt2	do you have two children?
na	A.77 utt1	I have two.
sd	A.77 utt2	One is four and a half
sd	A.77 utt3	and the other one's two and a half,
sv	B.78 utt1	Well they're expensive too. just the outgrowing of their clothes
aa	A.79 utt1	Yes .
sv	B.80 utt2	so I'm sure the budget,
b	A.81 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.81 utt4	I just came back to find jeans for the little one
sd	A.81 utt5	and it does add up.
b	B.82 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.84 utt1	And medical bill.
b	A.85 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.86 utt1	Although the insurance we had was good, when Thomas was younger. A lot of the stuff had to be paid up front
sd	B.86 utt2	and then you were reimbursed.
sd	B.86 utt3	So it was nice when you'd get a couple of hundred dollar check from the, insurance,
sd	B.88 utt2	but in the meantime you had to put out the money first.
b	@A.89 utt1	Yeah,
b	A.89 utt2	yeah.
sv	A.91 utt1	Well, that's, that's hard.
aa	B.92 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.92 utt2	it is.
sd	A.93 utt1	But I'm enjoying my stay home for the little time that I can .
sd	B.94 utt1	I would too.
sd	B.96 utt1	I would advise anyone that could possibly do it to,
sd	A.97 utt1	I know it's not forever
sd	A.97 utt2	and that's what's so sad
sv	B.98 utt1	Well, you probably wouldn't want to do it forever.
h	B.98 utt2	I don't know though .
