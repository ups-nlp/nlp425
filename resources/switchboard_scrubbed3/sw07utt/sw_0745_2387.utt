o	A.1 utt1	Okay,
qw	A.1 utt2	what types of music do you like to listen to?
sd	B.2 utt1	Well, I primarily listen to classical music when I have my druthers, partly because I find it more soothing.
sd	B.2 utt2	I don't know a lot about classical music so far as, any background in music,
sd	B.2 utt3	but it's the music I enjoy the most.
qo	B.2 utt4	How about you?
sd	A.3 utt1	I like classical music also.
sd	A.3 utt3	like you, I don't know a whole lot about it,
sd	A.3 utt4	and I would like to buy more classical tapes and stuff,
sd	A.3 utt5	but I'm not sure which composers or which I really like,
b	B.4 utt1	Right.
sd	A.5 utt2	so I kind of hesitate to buy something.
b	B.6 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.7 utt2	There are certain kinds I like and certain kinds I don't.
sd	B.8 utt1	I tend to listen to the classical music, on the radio a lot.
sd	B.8 utt2	well there several stations in this area that play, classical music all the time,
sd	B.8 utt3	but there's one in particular that is on both A M and F M so I can listen to it without, worrying.
sd	B.8 utt4	It's cute, though, because my children, when they get in the car, and I have, the button pushed for that, they always switch it to something else .
sd	B.10 utt1	Because naturally that isn't their taste at this point in time anyway.
b	A.11 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.13 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.13 utt2	I understand that.
qy	B.14 utt1	are you involved in music?
nn	A.15 utt1	no,
ng	A.15 utt2	not really.
sd	A.15 utt3	My husband is,
sd	A.15 utt4	but I do, the world a favor
sd	A.15 utt5	and I don't sing aloud, to anybody but myself .
sd	B.18 utt1	Well, my whole family is somewhat musical, and not from training, but just because we sing in our choir
sd	B.18 utt2	and my daughter's quite involved and all that sort of thing.
sd	B.18 utt3	So, I think that one of these days maybe she'll get involved in classical music, too, because that's usually what happens unless you get into rock, which isn't her voice style.
b	A.19 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.19 utt2	I don't care for rock, at all.
sd	A.19 utt3	I guess I'm real old fashioned in my musical tastes.
ar	B.20 utt1	No,
sv	B.20 utt3	well most of it is not all that exciting in that it is terribly repetitious.
aa	A.21 utt1	Yes.
sv	B.22 utt1	It's loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning.
sd	B.22 utt2	Now I do like folk song.
sv	B.22 utt3	and there have been some nice folk songs over the years that, you know, kind of still hang around.
b	A.23 utt1	Right.
sd	B.24 utt1	but, the more popular music I don't care for, usually.
b	A.25 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.26 utt1	even when I was a teenager I didn't really like the music of that period so much because I found I liked, a little bit more melodious music than what was often the popular, rock and roll kind of sound.
b	A.27 utt1	Yeah,
aa	A.29 utt1	I agree with that too.
sd	B.30 utt1	Although now I kind of enjoy hearing the rock and roll, I guess it makes me think I'm young again .
aa	A.31 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.31 utt2	now rock and roll seems tame compared to like the New Age and all that stuff.
bh	B.32 utt1	Isn't that the truth?
sv	B.32 utt2	It's funny.
sd	B.32 utt3	In fact, it's interesting to me that so many of the songs,
sd	B.32 utt4	now I grew up in the late fifties and early sixties,
sd	B.32 utt5	and so much of the music that was popular at that time, has come back.
b	A.33 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.34 utt1	And, you don't hear everything all the time,
sd	B.34 utt2	but you hear much of the same music, perhaps a new version of it,
sd	B.34 utt3	but it's the same stuff. which is always kind of funny.
b	A.35 utt1	Right.
sd	B.38 utt1	and I remember my older sister.
sd	B.38 utt2	I have a sister who's sixteen years older,
sd	B.38 utt3	and at the time that I was a late teenager I guess, I can't remember the year, SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES became popular.
sd	B.38 utt4	I think it was done by maybe the Platters or something.
b	A.39 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.40 utt2	and she laughed
sd(^q)	B.40 utt3	and she said, Well, you know, when I was a teenager, that had been,
sd(^q)	B.40 utt4	you know, some years before, she said, that was a version of, you know, a song then.
sd(^q)	B.40 utt5	And she said, It's very similar,
^q	B.40 utt6	but they've changed a little bit.
sd(^q)	B.40 utt7	She said, I like the original version better.
sd	B.40 utt8	Well, they did it again, about two or three years ago,
sd	B.40 utt9	and I laughed again.
sd(^q)	B.40 utt10	I said, Oh no, here we are .
bf	A.41 utt1	Crops up every so often.
aa	B.42 utt1	Right,
aa	B.42 utt2	right.
sd	B.42 utt3	It does indeed.
sd	A.43 utt1	I listen to, the Christian radio station when I'm in the car.
sd	A.43 utt2	K L T Y.
b	B.44 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.45 utt1	I like to listen to some of that.
aa	B.46 utt1	Yes,
sv	B.46 utt2	now there's some wonderful Christian music when you can find good stations.
b	A.47 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.48 utt1	the problem that I found, in this area is that there, there is inconsistency in the quality here.
b	A.49 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.50 utt2	If you get someone who's very good at selecting, it's okay,
sd	B.50 utt3	but sometimes they kind of get on a, a binge,
sd	B.50 utt4	and they play the same sort of thing over and over again, without really necessarily quality.
b	A.51 utt1	Yeah,
qw	A.51 utt2	where do you live?
sd	B.52 utt1	I live in the, Washington, D C area, Maryland.
sd	A.53 utt1	I thought maybe you lived in Dallas, because that's the complaint I make to my husband about the radio station too.
sd(^q)	A.53 utt2	I said, they're playing one of their ten songs.
b	B.54 utt1	Yes.
sv	A.55 utt2	It seems like every week they pick ten
sv	A.55 utt3	and they just play them over and over,
aa	B.56 utt1	Uh huh,
sv	B.56 utt3	there's so much available that I don't understand why they do that.
b	A.57 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.59 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.60 utt1	But, now my children have sometimes,
sd	B.60 utt2	they've gone to a few of the concerts and so on of Christian musicians that come to our youth group at our church.
sd	B.60 utt3	and when they buy a tape or something, sometimes that's fun because it's different and something I've not always heard,
sd	B.60 utt4	and, you know, I enjoy that.
aa	A.61 utt1	Right.
sd	A.61 utt2	My husband likes Sandy Patty songs.
sd	A.61 utt3	He likes to sing those in church.
sd*	A.61 utt4	He'd buy all the sound tracts he could get his hands on * typo tracks if he had the money to.
ba	B.62 utt1	wow.
b	B.64 utt1	Yeah,
ba	B.64 utt2	that's nice.
qy	B.64 utt3	So, is your husband a singer?
na	A.65 utt1	Well, just an amateur singer.
sd	A.65 utt2	He sings in the choir
sd	A.65 utt3	and he likes to do special music and stuff at church.
b	B.66 utt1	Right.
b	B.66 utt2	Yeah.
sv	B.66 utt3	Well, that's a good thing to do.
aa	A.67 utt1	Yeah,
aa^r	A.67 utt2	yeah,
sd	A.67 utt3	I like to hear him sing.
sd	A.67 utt4	He does a good job.
ba	B.68 utt1	That's nice,
qy	B.68 utt2	well, do you have children?
nn	A.69 utt1	No,
ng	A.69 utt2	not yet,
sd^e	A.69 utt3	we're expecting a baby in July.
ba	B.70 utt1	Well, wonderful.
sd	A.71 utt1	I guess we'll start listening,
sv	B.72 utt1	That'll be a musician.
aa	A.73 utt1	Yeah,
am	A.73 utt2	maybe so.
sd	A.73 utt3	We'll start listening to children's music .
sv	B.74 utt1	there's some wonderful Christian, children's tapes. you can get,
aa	A.75 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.75 utt2	there are.
sd	B.76 utt2	and I know when my children were younger, we found a lot of really nice tapes that they liked.
sd	B.76 utt3	there was an Agape music group,
sd	B.76 utt4	and, some of the songs I still find going over in my head over and over again because they were really, very memorable even though my children are now,
b	A.77 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.78 utt2	my youngest is almost sixteen.
sd	B.80 utt1	But I still find some of the same songs from those tapes I enjoy.
b	A.81 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.82 utt1	there's one that's, a little girl singing Practice Makes Perfect.
b	A.83 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.84 utt1	And, she's playing the piano.
b	A.85 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.86 utt1	And so she gets the wrong note every now and then.
sd	B.88 utt1	But then she keeps repeating it, practice makes perfect,
sd	B.88 utt2	and then you know, talking about that so far as Christian life, too,
sd	B.88 utt3	and it's really cute.
aa	A.89 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.89 utt2	that sounds really cute.
b	B.90 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.91 utt1	I tell my husband to sing to my stomach, because they say that babies can hear quite a lot while they're still in the womb,
sd	A.91 utt2	and I said, then when it's born you can hold it and sing that again
aa	B.92 utt1	Yeah,
aa	B.92 utt2	right.
sv	A.93 utt2	and maybe it'll comfort her, you know, when she's fussy and stuff.
aa	B.94 utt1	Yeah,
qy	B.94 utt2	well do you know something?
qw	A.95 utt1	What?
sd	B.96 utt1	Because I have always played classical music, or classical style,
sd	B.96 utt2	it's not always classical as, you know, the official, word might go,
sd	B.96 utt3	but, even when I was pregnant, of course I listened to that,
sd	B.96 utt4	and when our first child was, you know, an infant, of course, when I was around the house, I played that music, too.
sd	B.96 utt5	When he first made sounds that you could detect they were in the music scale.
b	A.97 utt1	Huh.
sd	B.98 utt1	Someone else noticed it
ba	A.99 utt1	How strange.
sd(^q)	B.100 utt1	and I said, well, I guess that's true.
sd	B.100 utt2	And it was somewhat melodious,
sd	B.100 utt3	in other words it wasn't just
b	A.101 utt1	Uh huh.
^2	A.103 utt1	Babbly.
sd	B.104 utt1	you know, it was really funny .
aa	A.105 utt1	I'll say, that is .
sv	A.105 utt2	Well, we'll have to keep up with that then.
aa	B.106 utt1	Right,
aa^r	B.106 utt2	right.
sd	B.106 utt3	I do think there is probably an influence there, because I noticed that even though popular music, the wilder stuff, was around when my older children were, you know, early adolescents, when they first start listening to music on their own they first ask for a radio of their own, and so on,
b	A.107 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.108 utt2	this same child, really listened to more, ballady or, pleasant sort of songs and even classical, rather than the real hard rock stuff that so many other kids listen to.
b	A.109 utt1	Huh.
sd	B.110 utt1	And I never, I didn't want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and wouldn't do it anymore .
aa	A.111 utt1	Right,
aa	A.111 utt2	yeah,
bf	A.111 utt3	have something to rebel against .
aa	B.112 utt1	Right .
sd	B.112 utt2	But, then I must say they all kind of like a variety of music, which is nice,
sd	B.112 utt3	I like that.
b	A.113 utt1	Yeah,
ba	A.113 utt2	that's good,
sv	A.113 utt4	variety is good.
b	B.114 utt1	Yeah.
sv^t	A.115 utt1	Well, I guess that covers it.
fc	A.115 utt2	It was real good talking to you.
fc	B.116 utt1	Well, it was nice talking to you,
fc	B.116 utt2	and good luck with the baby.
ft	A.117 utt1	Well, thanks,
fc	A.117 utt2	bye.
fc	B.118 utt1	Bye bye.
