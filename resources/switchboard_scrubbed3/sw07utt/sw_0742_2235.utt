o	A.1 utt1	Okay.
fp	B.2 utt1	Hi.
fp	A.3 utt1	Hi.
b	B.4 utt1	Okay.
qy	B.4 utt2	You want to start?
ny	A.5 utt1	yeah.
na	A.5 utt2	Sure.
sv	A.5 utt3	I think we should have a balanced budget even if it means that services are dramatically cut back.
sv	A.5 utt4	If you can't pay for it, you shouldn't have it.
o	A.5 utt5	Period.
aa	B.6 utt1	That is very true.
sv	B.8 utt1	However, our whole economy is based on loans.
b	A.9 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.10 utt1	but, bet right this moment, you probably have several loans out
sv	B.10 utt2	or you have borrowed money against your credit card or something
sd	B.12 utt1	Master Charge.
ar	A.13 utt1	I don't have a Master Charge,
o	A.13 utt2	thank you .
sv	B.14 utt1	But, see our whole system is built on owing not borrowing.
aa	A.15 utt1	Right.
sv	A.17 utt1	But, that's the problem, see.
sv	A.17 utt2	Our system shouldn't be based on owing and borrowing and all that.
aa	B.18 utt1	true.
sv	B.18 utt2	But, without it, people wouldn't be able to own automobiles
sv	B.18 utt3	or they wouldn't be able to own a house.
ar	A.19 utt1	Yes,
ar	A.19 utt2	they would.
sv	A.19 utt3	They just wouldn't be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own. Or the kind of homes that we think we deserve to own.
sv	A.19 utt4	We might have to, you know, just be able to,
sv	A.19 utt5	I think, if a generation went without debt, then the next generation,
sv	A.19 utt6	like, if our generation,
sd	A.19 utt7	my husband and I, we're twenty eight, the budget would balance. And that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford, which we wouldn't be destitute,
sd	A.19 utt8	I mean, we wouldn't be living on the street, by any means.
sd	A.19 utt9	But just compared to how spoiled we are, we would be in our own minds,
sd	A.19 utt10	but I feel like the generation after us would,
sv	A.19 utt11	man, it would be so good.
sv	A.19 utt12	It would be so much better.
sv	A.19 utt13	It wouldn't be perfect,
sv	A.19 utt14	but then, they could learn to live with what they could afford to save to buy.
sv	A.19 utt15	And if you want a nicer car than that, well, you save a little longer.
aa	B.20 utt1	Well, now I agree, I agree with you one hundred percent.
b	A.21 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.22 utt2	I'm just taking the other side so we'll have a discussion here.
sd	B.24 utt1	but I still go to right back to what I said.
qw	B.24 utt2	When is the time you had fifteen thousand dollars all at one time to go out and buy an automobile?
sd	A.25 utt1	But, see, we made poor choices in college.
sd	A.25 utt2	We took out two,
sd	A.25 utt3	both of us had twenty thousand dollars in loans, for student loans
b	B.26 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.27 utt1	and I look back on that,
sd	A.27 utt2	and I bought shoes.
sd	A.27 utt3	I went shopping.
sd	A.27 utt4	I did not need that money.
sd^r	A.27 utt5	I did not need it.
sd^r	A.27 utt6	I didn't need it.
sd	A.27 utt7	I shouldn't have even qualified to get it.
sd^r	A.27 utt8	I didn't need it.
sd	A.27 utt9	And it would have been a little rough,
sd	A.27 utt10	I might have eaten some bologna instead of roast beef out of the deli,
sd^r	A.27 utt11	but I did not need it.
sd	A.27 utt12	And as I look back now, now we're paying that back.
sd(^q)	A.27 utt13	I told my son, if you have to live in the ghetto to go to college, do it,
^q	A.27 utt14	but don't take out ten thousand dollars in loans.
^q	A.27 utt15	Don't do it.
sd	A.27 utt16	And I I hope, don't think he'll have to do that
sd	A.27 utt17	but, I just feel like if we didn't have those loans, we could have saved in the last five years the money for that,
sd	A.27 utt18	and I believe we would have, because God's really put it in our heart not to get in debt, you know.
sd	A.27 utt19	But we have friends in church that do this on a constant basis, that are totally debt free.
sd	A.27 utt20	And they pay cash for everything they buy.
b	B.28 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.29 utt1	Including new vans,
sd	A.29 utt2	and, so I guess, I've seen it done
sd	A.29 utt3	and I know you can do it, you know.
sv	A.29 utt4	But you have to drive that old car until you get that money saved up for that new van.
sv	A.29 utt5	And that's where Americans don't like to do it.
sv	A.29 utt6	and we don't want to cut back our services from the government, because we're spoiled.
sd	B.30 utt1	Well, I have one way to suggest reducing the budget.
qw	A.31 utt1	What?
sd	B.32 utt1	Very simple.
sv	B.32 utt2	Just take all these civil service employees, and, take some of those holidays away from them, like Columbus Day, President's Day, I mean, they get all these days off.
aa	A.35 utt1	I know.
b	A.37 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.38 utt1	Now give them, what a week, I think we here at T I get a total of eleven a year.
aa	A.39 utt1	I know.
b	A.41 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.42 utt1	And that's about, three or four less than civil servants get.
b	A.43 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.44 utt1	Now just look at that money the government could save if they didn't have all of those days off, all those holidays.
aa	A.45 utt1	Yeah,
aa	A.45 utt2	that is true.
sd	A.45 utt3	Because I always think the mail never comes on these days
sd(^q)	A.45 utt4	and you're like, well, what is it .
sd	A.45 utt5	You don't even know it's a holiday .
sv	B.46 utt1	Well, now don't forget the mail is something else again.
sd	B.46 utt2	That has nothing,
sd	B.46 utt3	they're not civil servant people.
qy	A.47 utt1	But isn't it in the federal budget?
nn	B.48 utt1	No,
nn^r	B.48 utt2	no,
sd^e	B.48 utt3	they have their own budget they go by.
qy	A.49 utt1	But isn't it part of our income,
qy^d	A.49 utt2	it's not part of our taxes?
nn	B.50 utt1	No.
qy	A.51 utt1	It's not?
sd	B.52 utt1	That's why the price of mailing a letter keeps going up.
b^m	A.53 utt1	That's why it keeps going up,
sd	B.54 utt1	You know, I could I can remember the days when it cost only three cents to mail, a letter.
sd	A.55 utt1	That's another topic .
sv	A.57 utt1	Those stamps are valuable, now.
b	B.58 utt1	Yeah.
fe	B.60 utt2	hey,
sd	B.60 utt3	I ought to go looking through some of my old mail.
ba	A.61 utt1	That's funny.
sv	A.61 utt3	and that is a good short term thing, though.
sv	A.61 utt4	That little things like that
sv	A.61 utt5	overall, though, I just think we're just going to, I don't know, see,
sd	A.61 utt7	I guess I'm kind of leery of this topic, because I know that Bush is real for the new world order. The one world government, and alleviating all, you know, national debt between all of the nations.
sd	A.61 utt8	But I see that to be a potential power problem later, with, who's going to be in charge with this new world order.
sd	A.61 utt9	And you know, I'm uncomfortable with that much power being in one place.
sd	A.61 utt10	But, I know, we already have a new money system.
sd	A.61 utt11	We already have new bills printed, for,
sd	A.61 utt12	the U S Treasury already has our new bills printed for new currency,
sd	A.61 utt13	and I've seen them .
sd	A.61 utt14	And so I know that the long term vision for the U S government is to alleviate all national debts and to start over afresh,
sd^r	A.61 utt15	but I'm concerned with who's going to have the power over this new world order that they keep talking about, you know.
sv	A.61 utt16	That's a lot of power for one or two people to have.
sd	A.61 utt19	in fact, I know what their long term vision is.
sd(^q)	A.61 utt20	I'm kind of like, you know, yeah, the only answer is to start over or to totally change our lifestyles.
sv	A.61 utt21	And I don't think Americans are willing to do it.
qo	B.62 utt1	Well, what about, sending all this money overseas supporting other governments, third world governments.
qo	B.62 utt2	How do you feel about that?
sv	A.63 utt1	I don't feel we should loan them money.
sd	A.63 utt2	If I wish our leaders were really seeking the Lord on these things,
sv	A.63 utt3	and if we feel led to give a country money to help them, fine.
sv	A.63 utt4	But I don't feel we should be loaning money like that.
sv	A.63 utt5	I mean, it doesn't work, I mean.
sv	B.64 utt1	Well, in so many cases, it's not a loan,
sv	B.64 utt2	it's just a give away.
sd	A.65 utt1	but it's not set up as a giveaway.
sd	A.65 utt2	If it were set up as giveaway,
sd(^q)	A.65 utt3	and it was something, that, I mean, our President and our leaders could be seeking God saying, God is it your will for us to bless this nation with this money,
^q	A.65 utt4	is it your will, this money and your will for us to give to them,
sv	A.65 utt5	and I believe if we gave it, no strings attached that God would bless our nation.
sv	A.65 utt6	But because our motive is interest, our motive is not pure, it just backfires,
sv	A.65 utt7	I mean, none of these nations have paid us back.
sv	A.65 utt8	But, you understand, I guess it's a principle of giving and receiving.
sv	A.65 utt9	You give it, no strings attached
sv	A.65 utt10	and they may never give you anything back,
sv	A.65 utt11	but because there's no strings attached, it like gives them a freedom to give us something back.
sv	A.65 utt12	And it might not be money,
sv	A.65 utt13	it might be, no taxes on our things, our computers going into their nation,
sv	A.65 utt14	it might come back in another way,
sv	A.65 utt15	but it would be come back.
sv	A.65 utt16	But because we're loaning it, I think that's the problem.
sv	A.65 utt17	And I don't mean give it to everybody that asks.
^q	A.65 utt18	Use a lot of discernment.
^q	A.65 utt19	Don't give money to every nation.
qy	A.65 utt20	You know, what I'm saying,
sv	A.65 utt21	I think we're loaning money to too many nations,
sv	A.65 utt22	but I think if we gave to a few select ones, that really needed it, that it would work out better for us and for them.
sd	A.65 utt23	And so now we have all these nations that owe us all this money
sv	A.65 utt24	and so I just think, we're never going to get that back, you know.
qy	A.65 utt25	Do you understand?
nn	B.66 utt1	No.
aa	B.66 utt2	that's true.
sd	B.66 utt3	I understand that France still owes us money from World War I.
b	A.67 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.68 utt1	And, World War Two debts have never been repaid.
sd	B.68 utt2	I think the U S just wrote them all off.
b	A.69 utt1	Yeah.
sd(^q)	B.70 utt1	And said, well, we'll cancel it just like they did to that Polish debt here, last week.
b	A.71 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.72 utt1	half the countries of the world simply canceled the Poland debts to help them.
b	A.73 utt1	Right.
qy	A.73 utt2	long term though, do you think it would best to see a one world, you know,
sv	A.73 utt3	you can't alleviate all national debts
qrr	A.73 utt4	or do you think it would be better for our leaders to just start seeking God on how to turn our nation around financially?
sd	A.73 utt5	That's my opinion.
sd	A.73 utt6	My opinion's the latter.
b	B.74 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.74 utt2	Well, I've got to respect your opinion.
sv	B.74 utt3	You have some solid ideas.
b	A.75 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	A.77 utt1	I know.
qw	A.77 utt2	What's yours?
qy	A.77 utt3	Do you agree
qrr	A.77 utt4	or do you disagree
qw	A.77 utt5	or I mean, what do you think long term?
sd	B.78 utt1	Well, I don't believe in a single government or a single control for the world.
b	A.79 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.80 utt1	that's asking for trouble.
sv	B.80 utt2	People are too different.
b	A.81 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.82 utt1	I mean you could travel from one coast to the other here in the U S and find a tremendous differences between the peoples.
sv	B.82 utt2	They have their own ideas how things should be run.
b	A.83 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.84 utt1	So, therefore, I don't believe there could be a single government for the whole world.
sv	B.84 utt2	There's too many societies involved,
sv	B.84 utt3	the language barriers.
b	A.85 utt1	Uh huh.
o	B.86 utt1	sure,
sd(^q)	B.86 utt2	somebody said years ago, well, let's make it English, international language.
b	A.87 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.88 utt1	That's a big laugh,
sv	B.88 utt2	we can't even make English a national language here in our country.
b	A.89 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.90 utt1	We've got too many, immigrants.
aa	A.91 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.91 utt2	Yeah.
sd	A.91 utt3	I know.
sd	B.92 utt1	They don't call them immigrants anymore,
sd	B.92 utt2	that was back in my granddaddy's day.
aa	A.93 utt1	Yeah.
bf	A.93 utt2	Different ethnic groups .
aa	B.94 utt1	Yes.
aa	B.94 utt2	Yeah
b	A.95 utt1	Yeah.
sd*	A.95 utt2	I know what your saying. / * typo your > you're
sd	B.96 utt1	My grandfather came over from Lithuania back, just before the turn of the century
b	A.97 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.98 utt1	and, as a matter of fact he's a draft dodger.
b	A.99 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.100 utt1	He, was supposed to serve some time.
sd	B.100 utt2	Well, he did serve his time in the militia.
b	A.101 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.102 utt1	And he came back.
sd	B.102 utt2	He was a civilian again
sd(^q)	B.102 utt3	and his father said well if,
