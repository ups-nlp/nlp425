sd	A.1 utt1	Carolyn, I have a little miniature Schnauzer.
b	B.2 utt1	Oh.
qw	A.3 utt1	What do you have?
sd	B.4 utt1	Well, it's kind of a mixed breed that we got from the Humane Society .
sv	A.5 utt1	You know, those make the pe , best pets.
sd	A.5 utt2	My, son has
sd	A.5 utt3	it's a real mixture,
sd	A.5 utt4	it's part, Doberman and part Husky .
ba	B.6 utt1	my.
b	A.7 utt1	Yes,
sd	A.7 utt2	and gentlest dog you ever met,
sd	A.7 utt3	and they got him from the, Humane Society here in Oklahoma City
sd	A.9 utt1	and she's just turned out to be a jewel.
sd	A.9 utt2	my little Schnauzer is my friend.
sd	A.9 utt3	She is so spoiled.
sd	A.9 utt4	She's a year and a half old now,
sd	A.9 utt5	and being single, she's become very important in my life
b	B.10 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.11 utt1	it's so nice to come home and find something, or someone who's really so happy to see you.
sd	B.12 utt1	Well, my children are the ones that wanted our pet,
sd	B.12 utt2	and this one is probably the best one that we have had.
sd	B.12 utt3	as I say, we got it from the Humane Society,
sd	B.12 utt4	and, we had lost a pet,
sd	B.12 utt5	and we really went there looking for the one that we had lost.
sd	B.12 utt6	It got out under the fence while we were on vacation,
sd	B.12 utt7	and we just looked all over for it and couldn't find it,
sd	B.12 utt8	but, when we walked in to the Humane Society, this little dog was, in the office and would sit up and beg,
sd	B.12 utt9	and just, he was so cute,
sd	B.12 utt10	and the kids just fell in love with it.
sd	B.12 utt11	We just couldn't leave without it.
sd	B.12 utt12	But, whoever had it before must have trained it real well, because you know, it's, a good house dog.
sd	B.12 utt13	I've never had one that I could keep in the house before and tolerate it .
sd	A.13 utt1	Sometimes I wish I had not gotten this one, it's a puppy, because I work
sd	A.13 utt2	and I'm not home
b	B.14 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.15 utt1	and unfortunately she's not as well trained as I would like her to be
b	B.16 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.17 utt1	and I realize it's my fault,
sd	A.17 utt2	I'm not doing a really great job as a disciplinarian,
sv	B.18 utt1	It's hard to do that when you're not there constantly,
aa	A.19 utt1	It is,
aa^r	A.19 utt2	it is.
sd	A.19 utt3	you know, she's real good,
sd	A.19 utt4	I can leave her all day in the bathroom with her toys and her food and everything,
sd	A.21 utt2	and, not one mess does she make
b	B.22 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.23 utt1	and then we go outside,
sd	A.23 utt2	and she'll stay outside for, thirty minutes to an hour, come inside and use the restroom.
sd	A.25 utt1	I just want to kill her at those times.
b	B.26 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.27 utt2	But she's a doll,
sd	A.27 utt3	she's a love,
sd	A.27 utt4	she really is.
sd	B.28 utt1	About the only time we have,
h	B.28 utt2	well, I shouldn't say the only time,
sd	B.28 utt3	but most of the time when we have problems with restroom is in the night,
sd	B.28 utt4	and, she usually stays inside at night.
sd	B.28 utt5	We try to take her out right before we go to sleep,
sd	B.28 utt6	but, sometimes it doesn't work .
sd	A.29 utt1	You know, I, we always had a pet when I was growing up, always had a dog.
sd	A.29 utt2	My mother did not like cats.
sd	A.29 utt3	So we always had a dog,
sd	A.29 utt4	and then, course, when my children were growing up, we always had a dog, and always said it was because the children wanted the pet
b	B.30 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.31 utt1	and I find that I'm enjoying this one far more than I ever did when it was the children's dog,
b	B.32 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.33 utt1	in fact my children gave me this little puppy for Christmas.
ba	B.34 utt1	What a cute idea.
aa	A.35 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.35 utt2	I think so .
sd	B.36 utt1	Well, we got one one year for Christmas,
sd	B.36 utt2	and, I had a baby the next day
ba	A.37 utt1	my goodness.
sd	B.38 utt1	and, so that one wasn't really well trained .
bf	A.39 utt1	Two babies,
b	A.39 utt2	huh.
b	A.41 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.42 utt1	I just didn't have time to take care of baby and train puppy at the same time,
sv	A.43 utt1	that is really probably bad timing.
aa	B.44 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.44 utt3	it was,
sd	B.44 utt4	it really was.
sd	B.44 utt5	The older kids had wanted one, though,
sd	B.44 utt6	and, you know, we thought, well that would be a fun time for them to you know, get it at Christmas time.
sd	B.44 utt7	It was a little Spitz, wi , a little white fluffy and, you know, looked like it came right from the north pole,
ba	A.45 utt1	yes,
sd	B.46 utt2	and that was fun,
sd	B.46 utt3	but, I sure wasn't good at training it
sv	B.48 utt1	I think you have to have time, you know to do those things.
^2	A.49 utt1	and patience
sv	A.51 utt1	and you really have to be, just like your children,
sv	A.51 utt2	when you set a rule you have to stand by it, and be consistent
aa	B.52 utt1	That's right.
