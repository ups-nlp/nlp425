sd	A.1 utt2	I don't have any children
sd	A.1 utt3	but I've, uh, I was a baby sitter in high school.
sd	A.1 utt4	And then, just recently, after we were married, I baby sat for a dentist while she worked.
b	B.2 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.2 utt2	That's the only thing I've ever done also, is baby sit.
qy	A.3 utt1	Is it? {Very faint}.
sd	B.4 utt1	But, uh, I've heard people that I work with talk about, you know, child care.
sv	B.4 utt2	Especially, I guess it's even harder on single mothers.
aa	A.5 utt1	Oh, yeah.
sd	A.5 utt2	The expense.
b	B.6 utt1	Yeah.
^2	B.6 utt2	Having to pick up the kid by, you know, six o'clock
sd	B.6 utt3	or it's five dollars for every minute you're late. And stuff like that .
b	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.8 utt1	Which is understandable.
sv	B.8 utt2	I mean, these people can't, you know, stay there till eight o'clock because somebody has to work late
^2	A.9 utt1	Just sit around .
aa	A.9 utt2	That that's true.
sd	A.11 utt2	See the lady I did it for,
sd	A.11 utt3	that's why she picked me is because I would go to her house so she wouldn't have to get her little girl up.
sd	A.11 utt4	So she could sleep in.
sd	A.11 utt5	And, uh, then she could be at home
sd	A.11 utt6	and then I'd bring her to my house for a couple of hours if I wanted too or whatever.
sd	A.11 utt7	But, uh, she paid, I think it was two or, I think it was about two fifty, three dollars a hour
sd	A.11 utt8	and by the time I paid taxes on it, it, I was getting like eighty cents
sd	A.11 utt9	and that wasn't counting food or gas or anything.
ba	B.12 utt1	Oh, no.
b	B.14 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.14 utt2	It's hardly worth your time.
b	A.15 utt1	Yeah.
b^m	B.16 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.16 utt2	That's pretty bad.
sd	B.16 utt3	The only time I baby sat was in high school
sd	B.16 utt6	I didn't pay taxes on that,
b	A.17 utt1	Right.
sv	B.18 utt1	It was easy, you know, go over to some, uh,
sd	B.18 utt2	it was these people that lived in our neighborhood
sd	B.18 utt3	and I'd just go over there.
sd	B.18 utt4	Every Thursday night, they went to the theater.
sd	B.18 utt5	They had permanent tickets
sd	B.18 utt6	and they'd give me,
sd	B.18 utt7	it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids,
sd	B.18 utt8	but they would usually give me like five dollars more at the end of the night.
ba	A.19 utt1	Oh, wow.
sv	B.20 utt2	it was great.
sd	B.20 utt3	I'd go over there
sd(^q)	B.20 utt4	and there would be like, uh, you know, there's, we have these videos over here.
^q	B.20 utt5	Watch, whatever you want.
^q	B.22 utt2	And there's some Oreos in the, in the cupboard.
^q	B.22 utt3	And there's some Coke
^q	B.22 utt4	and you know, just help yourself to anything.
sv	B.22 utt5	So it was, it was, you know, the best,
ba	A.23 utt1	Wow.
sd	B.24 utt2	that was a long time ago
sd	B.24 utt3	and that was only for a few years.
sd	B.24 utt4	Just once a week.
b	A.25 utt1	Yeah.
h	B.26 utt1	But I don't know.
sv	A.27 utt1	I think people that treat their baby sitters like that get a lot better baby sitters.
aa	B.28 utt1	Oh, yeah.
aa	B.28 utt2	That's true.
sv	A.29 utt1	And they stick around for longer.
sd(^q)	A.29 utt2	Because I mean after I figured out I was getting eighty cents an hour, I said bag it.
sd	A.29 utt3	And I quit , you know.
b	B.30 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.31 utt1	I was just like but I'm wasting my time.
b^r	B.32 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.33 utt1	I really liked the little girl and everything
sd	A.33 utt2	but I thought ...
^2	B.34 utt1	She does take up,
sv	B.34 utt2	and they do take up a lot of your time.
aa	A.35 utt1	Yeah.
aa^r	A.35 utt2	Yeah,
sv	B.36 utt1	They're very demanding .
b	A.37 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.39 utt1	Well, and she was really spoiled.
sd	A.39 utt2	They didn't make her eat anything she didn't want or anything.
sd	A.39 utt3	So, basically, they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch.
sd	A.41 utt1	And the mom was a dentist
sd(^q)	A.41 utt2	and I was just like, we've got to quit this.
sd(^q)	A.41 utt3	And she's like no I don't want her to starve.
^q	A.41 utt4	But I don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat .
fe	B.42 utt1	Oh, shoot.
sd(^q)	B.42 utt2	My mom would be like, uh eat it or don't eat anything.
^2	A.45 utt1	Eat this or .
aa	B.46 utt2	That's right.
sv	A.47 utt1	So, I can see the concerns on what different people want.
b	B.48 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.49 utt2	I mean, you know, if I was setting up a daycare, there would be so many needs you would have to customize your service to.
b	B.50 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.52 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.53 utt1	Cause some parents won't put up anything. Where others would.
b	B.54 utt2	yeah,
sv	B.54 utt3	I think the best way to go would just be to, to be able to do it out of your basement.
b	A.55 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.56 utt1	And just have like t , at the most, like ten kids.
sv	B.56 utt2	And all from maybe people that you know type of thing.
ar	A.57 utt1	No.
sv	B.58 utt2	Instead of trying actually to set up a daycare where you don't know the people coming in and ...
aa	A.59 utt1	That's true.
sd	A.59 utt2	I, I'd love to do it.
sd	A.59 utt3	But I just don't trust people now.
sv	A.59 utt4	There's too many lawsuits.
b	B.60 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.61 utt1	I just, I think it's a bigger risk than ...
bf	B.62 utt1	More than what it's worth?
aa	A.63 utt1	Yeah.
b^m	B.64 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.65 utt1	It would scare me.
h	A.65 utt3	I don't know,
sv	A.65 utt4	cause I'm sure some of them have good reason to sue
sv	A.65 utt5	but I think a lot of them are just, you know, they're negligent
sv	A.65 utt6	and they get happy about money
sv	A.65 utt7	and they just want to sue you.
b	B.66 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.68 utt1	Well, yeah.
aa	B.68 utt3	yeah,
aa	B.68 utt4	exactly.
sv	B.68 utt5	When you have like a Kindercare or something set up and th , when they get greedy or whatever, that's when they have maybe one assistant to twenty kids or something
b	A.69 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.71 utt1	Oh, yeah.
sv	B.72 utt2	you can't watch that many little kids getting into things at one time .
sv	A.73 utt1	That's impossible.
sv	B.74 utt2	You know, you never know what they're going to get into.
sd	A.75 utt1	I have a girlfriend that works at a daycare
sd	A.75 utt2	and she takes her little girl with her
sd	A.75 utt3	and, I mean, she told me about half the people that they hire
sd	A.75 utt4	and half of them she'd like to turn them into the state .
sd	A.75 utt5	And that's the people that are working there, you know.
sd	A.75 utt6	And then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in, you know.
ba	B.76 utt1	Oh, that's horrible.
sd	A.77 utt1	Like they'll be in the same clothes they were the day before, the same diaper.
b	B.78 utt1	Huh.
sd	A.79 utt1	You know, just awful things.
h	A.79 utt2	And so I don't know.
sd	A.79 utt3	I don't have kids
sv	A.79 utt4	but I always think man I just don't know if I could trust anybody.
sv	A.79 utt5	I mean, you just don't know.
b	B.80 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.80 utt3	yeah,
sv	B.80 utt4	that's a hard thing about it.
sv	B.80 utt5	If, I mean, I don , I can't foresee myself getting married
qh	B.80 utt6	but if, you know, if I ever wanted to have a kid, how could I work.
sv	B.80 utt7	I mean, I don't think I could trust somebody with my kid either.
sv	B.80 utt8	Unless it was a friend that, you know, did it in {sounds like an airplane} their house that I knew well.
aa	A.81 utt1	Oh, yeah.
aa	A.81 utt2	That's true.
b	A.83 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.84 utt1	I just, I couldn't do it I don't think.
sv	A.85 utt1	It would just rip me apart, I think .
h	A.85 utt2	I don't know.
b	B.86 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.87 utt1	Just not knowing.
b	B.88 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.88 utt2	just besides the fact that, you know, your, when your child gets out of school at three o'clock and then has to wait.
