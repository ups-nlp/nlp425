sd^t	A.1 utt1	Okay, I guess, we are just supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time.
b	B.2 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.3 utt1	I basically read books.
b	B.4 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.5 utt2	I do.
sd	A.5 utt3	Sometimes, when everybody's gone to bed, my kids are in bed and my husband in bed,
sd	A.5 utt4	so I will just stay up and finish a book that I am,
sd	A.5 utt5	I have about three books that I am going on.
sd	A.5 utt6	And I will work on one for a little bit, you know, and then the next one.
sv	B.6 utt1	Well, that is pretty impressive to have three books going.
bd	A.7 utt1	Not always,
bd	A.7 utt2	just sometimes.
b	B.8 utt1	yeah.
qw	B.8 utt2	And what what kind of books do you read?
sd	A.9 utt1	just really different ones.
sd	A.9 utt2	I have one that I was reading on, raising your children and then another one on an autobiography, and another one on, like a crime story .
b	B.10 utt1	yeah
sd	A.11 utt1	A true crime story.
qy	B.12 utt1	do you like those detective stories?
ny	A.13 utt1	Yeah.
sd^e	A.13 utt3	it was a true one.
sd	A.13 utt4	It was just a little different though.
sd	A.13 utt5	Reading that one last night.
ba	B.14 utt1	well that is interesting.
sd	B.14 utt2	Actually, I like to read also,
sd	B.14 utt3	but, usually fall into one or two categories, either true science fiction or fantasy on the one hand or highly technical.
b	A.15 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.15 utt2	like my husband.
b	B.16 utt1	Yeah
b	A.17 utt1	Yeah
b	B.18 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.18 utt2	kind of one or the other.
o@	B.18 utt3	 I do.
qy^d	A.19 utt1	You must, work for T I?
ny	B.20 utt2	Yes.
b	A.21 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.21 utt2	my husband does too.
b	B.22 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.22 utt2	and I am a computer scientist.
b	A.23 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.24 utt1	But, I have a lot of other hobbies.
b	A.25 utt1	Uh huh,
b	A.25 utt2	really.
b	B.26 utt1	Well, yeah,
sd	B.26 utt2	I am kind of, I guess what you would call a project person.
b	A.27 utt1	really.
b	B.28 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.28 utt2	and I love,
sd	B.28 utt3	like I have a shop
sd	B.28 utt4	and when things break around the house, I always try to fix them myself
sd	B.28 utt6	its' funny,
sd	B.28 utt7	from the one stand point, it is work.
sd	B.28 utt8	But it is a hobby too, that I enjoy to do.
b	A.29 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.30 utt2	To find broken,
b	A.31 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.31 utt2	yeah.
qw	A.31 utt3	What kinds of things do you fix?
sd	B.32 utt1	Well, essentially anything you find in a house. a stove, or oven or a broken piece of porcelain or, chipped tile on the floor. I mean just anything.
b	A.33 utt1	Oh.
qy	A.33 utt2	And you have a shop?
na	B.34 utt1	Well it is not anything elaborate.
sd	B.34 utt2	It is just a work bench and a gazillion tools.
b	A.35 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.36 utt1	But, enough that, again for anything in the house I could probably,
b	A.37 utt1	Yeah,
^2	A.37 utt2	you can fix just about everything and anything.
aa	B.38 utt1	Right.
ba	A.39 utt1	Well, that is great.
sd	B.40 utt2	I guess the car too.
b	A.41 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.42 utt1	And so, I think I probably would consider that a hobby.
sd	B.42 utt2	Although, sometimes it gets to be excessive.
b	A.43 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.43 utt2	That is pretty much like my husband.
sd	A.43 utt3	he is pretty, mobile in that area too.
sd	A.43 utt4	he works on the cars.
sd	A.43 utt5	He rarely takes them in
b	B.44 utt1	Yeah
sd	A.45 utt1	and, he works on irons, and all T V s and stuff too.
sd	A.45 utt2	We rarely have to take those things in too.
b	B.46 utt1	Right.
b	B.46 utt2	Yeah,
sv	B.46 utt4	not only can it be fun,
sv	B.46 utt5	but it can certainly help your finances.
aa	A.47 utt1	yeah.
aa	A.47 utt2	Yeah,
aa	A.47 utt3	definitely.
qr	B.48 utt1	So, do you have any how do I say it, creative or artistic hobbies?
ng	A.49 utt1	Not really.
sd	A.49 utt2	I mean during Christmas I work on, you know, like, holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things.
b	B.50 utt1	yeah,
ba	B.50 utt2	well that's good.
bd	A.51 utt1	but, not really .
b	B.52 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.52 utt2	Well, I don't necessarily either.
sd	B.52 utt3	I can plink out a song or two on a piano
b	A.53 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.54 utt2	I don't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art,
sv	B.54 utt3	I guess graphic arts is that what they call it,
b	A.55 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.57 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.58 utt2	I can't do any of that,
sd	B.58 utt3	but sweat shirts is certainly impressive.
b	A.59 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.59 utt2	I belong to this organization if you have preschool children
b	B.60 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.61 utt1	and, every once and a while they will have a craft, section for the moms
b	B.62 utt1	yeah.
sd	A.63 utt1	and those are really neat
sd	A.63 utt2	and we learn to do the, transfer pictures on the sweatshirts transfer photos
b	B.64 utt1	yeah.
b	B.66 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.67 utt1	and, those are really neat.
sd	A.67 utt2	So we learn different crafts like that ,
ba	B.68 utt1	I see.
ba	B.70 utt1	Well, that is neat .
b	A.71 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.72 utt1	I guess you could consider that a hobby.
qy	B.72 utt2	do you cook for a hobby
qrr	B.72 utt3	or do you,
nn	A.73 utt1	No
sd^e	A.73 utt2	I cook dinner .
sv	B.74 utt1	That's not something you,
sv	A.75 utt1	I don't consider it a hobby .
ba	B.76 utt1	I understand that.
nn	A.77 utt2	no
sd	A.77 utt3	I am not a real elaborate cook or anything like that unfortunately.
b	B.78 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.79 utt1	I like to bake off and on.
sd	A.79 utt2	And usually once a week I will bake something,
sd	A.79 utt3	but it's not anything elaborate, you know .
b	B.80 utt1	Right.
sd	A.81 utt1	At least, I don't think it is.
b	B.82 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.84 utt1	But, I think that still borders on hobby.
b	A.85 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.86 utt1	Probably the other thing I do which I am sure will sound horrible to you, is I program for fun. on the computer.
b	A.87 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.88 utt1	So, I have little computer projects going on that I consider hobbies.
b	A.89 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.90 utt1	But, drive my wife crazy.
b	A.91 utt1	Oh.
ba	A.91 utt2	Well good.
qy^d	A.91 utt3	You have a computer at home?
na	B.92 utt1	I do,
ny	B.92 utt2	yes.
ba	A.93 utt1	good.
sd	B.94 utt1	In fact, there is actually several of them here right now.
b	A.95 utt1	really.
sd	B.96 utt1	Not all of them being mine.
ba	A.97 utt1	Wow.
qy^d	A.97 utt2	Then you are busy .
ny	B.98 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.99 utt1	Uh huh,
ba	A.99 utt2	that is very good.
qy	B.100 utt1	I wonder if you can construe raising children as being a hobby?
sd	A.101 utt1	Well, you know one of the books that I was reading,
sd	A.101 utt2	and I stopped because it was so,
sd	A.101 utt4	the book is so detailed
b	B.102 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.103 utt1	and you have to,
sd	A.103 utt2	sometimes I have to go back and read the page over again cause I didn't quite get it all.
sd	A.103 utt3	And, it is so detailed,
