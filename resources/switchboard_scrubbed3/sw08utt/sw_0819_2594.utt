qw	A.1 utt1	So, Jan, how do they recycle in Texas?
sd	B.2 utt2	the biggest, way it's going right now, lot, } most of the grocery stores have got, things set up where you can bring in your, plastic, and your cans, and newspapers.
b	A.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.4 utt2	And then they've just got different barrels setting out
sd	B.4 utt3	, I shouldn't say barrels, like big John Doors or, whatever they're, called. Gondolas .
b	A.5 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.7 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.9 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.10 utt1	they've got them set outside
qy	A.11 utt1	Is it, is it all voluntary?
ny	B.14 utt1	Yes.
sd^e	B.14 utt2	It's all voluntary.
sd	B.14 utt3	Now, they do have some places where you can take things and get cash
o@	B.14 utt4	but, I think the lot of people don't really want the cash.
b	A.15 utt1	Right.
b	A.17 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.18 utt1	You know, they just want to, help recycle. Which is, what we do. You know,
b	A.19 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.21 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.22 utt2	probably the only thing, sometimes we'll take or the cans in
sd	B.22 utt3	and we let the kids get the money for that.
b	A.23 utt1	Right.
b	A.23 utt2	Yeah.
sd	A.25 utt1	There's, a lot of projects where the Boy Scouts and things, that will, collect your cans
b	B.28 utt1	Right.
o@	A.29 utt2	and, it's a good fund raiser for the kids.
b	B.30 utt1	Right.
aa	B.32 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.32 utt2	That's true,
sd	B.32 utt3	but that's really the biggest thing around here is the grocery stores participating.
b	A.33 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.35 utt2	you see, I guess it depends on your landfill space.
b	B.36 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.37 utt2	we're in Maryland,
sd*	A.37 utt4	I from Pennsylvania / * missing copula?
sd	A.37 utt5	and my parents are forced recycling,
bh	B.38 utt1	 really?
b	A.41 utt1	Yeah.
sd@	A.41 utt2	they ha , all plastic has to go into a recycling bin, all cans have to be recycled, all newspapers has to be recycled. Because they're just running out of space and landfills.
ba	B.42 utt1	wow.
sv	A.43 utt2	Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York are some of the,
sv	A.43 utt3	they're using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones.
b	B.44 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.45 utt1	So, it's, really hard on them.
sd	A.45 utt2	Now, up here in Maryland, though, we're just in a voluntary recycling stage right now.
sd	A.45 utt3	so my wife and I, you know, we save our bottles,
sd	A.45 utt4	and we save our newspapers,
sd	A.45 utt5	and we save all our plastic, and all of our tin cans.
sd	A.45 utt6	And just like you say, we go to, a community area where they have it set up
sd	A.45 utt7	and we dump them off there.
qy^d	B.46 utt1	So, it's vol ,
ny	A.47 utt1	Yeah.
sd^e	A.47 utt2	It's still voluntary, though I think we're supposed to have something implemented by nineteen ninety three, though where some aspects will be mandatory.
sd	B.48 utt1	you say it is all voluntary.
qy	B.48 utt2	Do they,
qy	B.50 utt1	Will it be mandatory?
b	A.51 utt2	Uh huh.
qy	B.52 utt1	Is it all,
qy	B.52 utt2	is there any place at all where you do get cash for this stuff
qrr	B.52 utt3	or is it all,
sd	A.53 utt1	Mostly just the cans.
bk	B.54 utt1	Okay.
b	B.56 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.57 utt1	and most of the time, like I said, that's a sort of like fund raiser things that, the schools do, or that the Boy Scouts do, or whatever.
b	B.58 utt1	Right.
b	B.60 utt1	Right.
b	A.61 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.62 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.62 utt2	That's true.
sv	A.63 utt1	Cans are the only thing I think you really get money for.
ar	B.64 utt1	Well, they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers, and stuff like that.
b	A.65 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.66 utt2	But, you know, I think a lot of people, like I said, are more concerned,
b	A.67 utt1	Right.
b	A.67 utt2	Uh huh.
 +	B.68 utt1	with, you know, right now, you know, the aspects of saving the earth .
b	A.69 utt1	Yeah,
o@	B.70 utt1	 Uh huh.
sv	A.71 utt1	I think that's mostly,
sd(^q)	A.71 utt4	as soon as the community said, you know, We're going to put up bins for recycling, you know, we automatically started, doing it.
sv	A.73 utt2	It was, it's one of those things,
b	B.74 utt1	Right.
sd	A.75 utt2	you know, and just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be, separated, you know.
b	B.76 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.78 utt1	Well, I tell you, it's kind of funny now even at T I, I don't,
qy	B.78 utt2	do you work for T I?
nn	A.79 utt1	No.
nn	A.79 utt2	Huh uh.
bk	B.80 utt1	Okay.
sd	B.80 utt2	at T I they're doing recycling.
sd	B.80 utt3	I mean, for a long time they didn't do this,
sd	B.80 utt4	but now they're recycling cans and paper.
sd	B.80 utt5	We have separate bins separate wastebaskets in our offices for paper.
b	A.81 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.83 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.85 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.86 utt2	I mean it's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees
sd	B.86 utt3	and, you know it's really,
b	A.87 utt1	Right.
sd	B.88 utt2	I can't believe that you know. Because they've got it all posted all over the place how much, they're saving and how w ,
b	A.89 utt1	Yeah.
^2	A.91 utt1	how well they're doing.
sd	A.93 utt2	I, I work in a, speech interface lab, at a, at a college.
b	B.94 utt1	okay.
sd	A.95 utt2	And we do basically the same thing.
sd	A.95 utt3	The state of Maryland has asked all the colleges and universities, and some of the large organizations, you know, if they would definitely recycle their office paper.
b	B.96 utt1	Uh huh.
o@	A.97 utt1	And, the same thing, you know, almost every college in Maryland is recycling office paper.
b	B.98 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.99 utt2	But, you know, in the giant bins around,
sv	A.99 utt3	and it's surprising how much you never realize, because that janitor comes around and empties your garbage, can every night.
b	B.100 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.102 utt1	Right.
b	B.104 utt1	Yep.
o@	B.104 utt2	So, you don't think about it.
sv	A.105 utt1	You don't notice until, you start leaving,
sd	A.107 utt2	you know, they don't pick up your recycling until it's full
o@	A.107 utt3	and, you just can't believe how much paper that you,
b	B.108 utt1	Right.
ba	B.110 utt1	I know .
sv	A.111 utt1	Reams of paper come, out of an office every day . That , took us to recycle.
b@	B.112 utt1	Yep . Yeah.
sv	B.114 utt2	Well, you think about, the waste, even.
b	A.117 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.118 utt1	I mean, you know, cost wise and and, you know, saving trees and stuff like that.
b	A.119 utt1	Right.
sd	B.120 utt2	I mean, it's just amazing, you know, the difference.
b	A.121 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.121 utt2	So, I think, Hopefully, if,
qy	A.123 utt2	you know, I guess a lot of the large organizations, probably T I, did they advertise on television how successful they are?
nn	B.124 utt1	N ,
sd^e	B.126 utt1	I haven't seen, anything.
b	A.127 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.128 utt2	but that doesn't mean that they don't.
sd	B.128 utt3	I don't watch much T V,
b	A.129 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.130 utt1	but, I haven't really seen anything advertise publicly.
b	A.131 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.132 utt1	And then, like I said, they do a lot of internal, advertising on that kind of stuff.
b^m	A.133 utt1	Internal.
b	A.135 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.136 utt1	But, I haven't seen anything.
b	A.137 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.138 utt1	But see, I don't see a lot of T I advertisements on T V anyway.
sv	B.138 utt2	I think they advertise more, other places where they're not located.
aa	A.139 utt1	Right.
aa	A.139 utt2	Yeah.
aa	A.139 utt3	That would probably, be true.
sd^r	B.140 utt1	You know. So, So, I don't see a lot of advertisements for T I.
b	A.143 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.143 utt2	Because I know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television,
sd	A.143 utt3	you know, they'll come up and say,
sd	A.143 utt4	you know, they'll show you , to encourage recycling.
sd	A.143 utt5	They'll, say,
b	B.144 utt1	Right.
^q	A.145 utt2	And here, those of us that Dumavra Power, which is our power company, that,
b	B.146 utt1	Uh huh.
^q	A.147 utt2	we now recycle forty five percent of our solid waste,
b	B.148 utt1	Right .
^q	A.149 utt3	we do this for the community,
sv	A.149 utt4	they put those on.
sv	A.149 utt5	so I think, you know, we're probably reaching a successful stage and just with voluntary, I think.
b	B.150 utt1	Right.
sv	B.152 utt1	Well, even, I mean, in the kid's schools, I mean they do things to try and recycle.
b	A.153 utt1	Uh huh.
sd(^q)	B.154 utt2	And, I know my kids, like if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say, look at that. Somebody is not saving the earth, you know.
b	A.155 utt1	Right.
b	A.155 utt2	Yeah.
sv	B.156 utt1	So, I mean, the kids, I mean, they really try to educate all ages, you know,
sv	B.156 utt2	and it's good to start the kids real young on, stuff like that. Because, I mean, when I was a kid, they never did stuff like that.
aa	A.157 utt1	I think so, too.
b	A.159 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.160 utt2	I mean, it's like nobody was concerned about it.
aa	A.161 utt1	Right.
aa	A.161 utt2	Yeah.
sv	A.161 utt3	We weren't, concerned.
sd	B.162 utt1	You know, and it's like,
aa	A.163 utt2	Yeah.
aa	A.163 utt3	That's true.
sd(^q)	B.164 utt1	You know, it's like all of a sudden when there's noticeable things, saying, Hey, you know, we're ruining the earth,
b	A.165 utt1	Huh.
sv	B.166 utt2	you know. And now everybody is doing something about, which is good.
b	A.167 utt1	Uh huh.
qw	B.168 utt1	But how come we weren't doing this, say, twenty years ago , you know?
b	A.169 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.171 utt1	I think really probably what hit peoples, you know, I know that here up in the, the New Englands area and also in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York, all of a sudden we're out of landfill.
b	B.172 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.173 utt1	and they're saying, We estimate this landfill be ov , will be full in two years unless we cut back.
o@	A.173 utt2	And, even then, you know, we're really running out of space.
b	B.174 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.175 utt2	So, I think that, that became,
sv	A.175 utt3	that all of a sudden really hit home that there's no longer landfill space, in some of the more crowded states.
o@	B.176 utt1	Well, Yeah.
sd	A.179 utt3	I'm sure Texas probably still has some landfill space.
sv(^q)	A.179 utt4	They're not going to voluntarily say, Hey, ship your garbage here.
b	B.180 utt1	Right .
o@	A.181 utt1	So, you know, realistically, you know, we really had to start, we have to start recycling in some, geographic areas.
aa	B.182 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.182 utt2	That's true.
sd	A.183 utt2	It's really, tough.
sv	B.184 utt1	I think, that it really surprises me because of the cost savings.
sd	B.186 utt2	I mean, this is such a tremendous, amount of cost savings.
b	A.187 utt1	Uh huh.
qh	B.188 utt3	I can't understand why nobody saw that before.
sd	B.188 utt4	I mean, even not even the aspects of not saving the earth ,
b	A.189 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.190 utt2	{E I, mean, } it's, so cost, you know,
b	A.191 utt1	Right.
b	A.193 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.195 utt1	Well, in some ways, I guess, it doesn't become really cost saving until you have an industry around it, you know. Because, I know that, like in, Pennsylvania, they require them to, put their newspaper for recycling.
o@	B.196 utt1	Bro , . yeah.
sd	A.199 utt2	But, the de inking process that they use, to take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused is very expensive,
b	B.200 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.202 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.204 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.205 utt1	and also, it produces a waste, a, liquid waste that they don't know what to do with yet.
b	B.206 utt1	Oh. I see,
o@	A.209 utt1	So, even some aspects of recycling they still have cost, yeah, cost efficient, yet.
b	B.210 utt1	okay.
^2	B.212 utt1	Is not real cost efficient.
b	B.214 utt2	okay,
b^r	B.214 utt3	okay.
sd	B.216 utt1	I, understand that though.
sd	A.217 utt1	So, but others, you know, like tin cans and plastics, are really, efficient, you know.
b	B.220 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.221 utt2	They, they melt on quickly you know, just because of the, heating and things, getting glass.
b	B.222 utt1	Right.
^2	B.224 utt1	and glass.
b	B.224 utt2	Right.
b	B.226 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.227 utt2	it really is surprising that people haven't noticed it before.
aa	B.228 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.228 utt2	That's true.
b	A.229 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.230 utt2	I noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil.
b	A.231 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.232 utt1	And, I mean, that kind of surprises me .
sd	B.232 utt2	I mean, you know, because once oil gets so, you know, thick and yucky, you'd wonder how they could, you know, clean that up, enough to use it again,
b	A.233 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.234 utt2	but they can.
b	A.235 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.236 utt1	I don't know how cost efficient that would be, I guess,
b	A.237 utt1	Yeah.
h	A.237 utt2	I don't know either.
sd	A.237 utt4	I know that though, all those petroleum products though are so terrible for the water table.
b	B.238 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.239 utt1	You know, they really pollute quickly
sd@	A.239 utt3	, I was reading some place the you put, brake fluid normally comes in just small little pint containers. That one pint of brake fluid can contaminate so many gallons of water, you know, like hundreds of gallons of water.
b	B.240 utt1	Uh huh.
ba	B.242 utt1	Wow.
sv	A.243 utt2	So, it's one of those things that they really,
qh@	A.243 utt3	and you wonder, you know, with all these oil spills. how terrible that is .
b	B.244 utt1	Yeah
aa	B.246 utt1	Yeah.
ba	B.246 utt2	I know .
b	A.247 utt1	Yeah,
qh^m	A.247 utt2	how terrible that is.
sv	A.247 utt3	So, we'll have to keep our eyes on all that, I guess.
b	B.248 utt1	Really.
b	A.249 utt1	Uh huh.
h	B.250 utt2	I don't know,
sv	B.250 utt3	I think that, I mean, I think that they really are doing a good thing now
sv	B.250 utt4	and I hope it keeps,
sv	B.250 utt5	well, I'm sure we'll keep up.
aa	A.251 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.251 utt2	I, agree.
qy	B.252 utt1	You know,
sv	B.254 utt1	I think it's really catching on.
b	A.255 utt1	Uh huh.
h	B.256 utt3	I don't know,
sv	B.256 utt4	I think it's a good idea to make it mandatory .
aa	A.257 utt1	I do, too.
sd(^q)	B.258 utt2	because like we were asking some people that live in, North Dakota, Well, you know, are you recycling.
sd(^q)	B.258 utt4	And they said, Well, we're not forced to do it yet,
sv	B.258 utt5	so no.
b	A.259 utt1	Uh huh.
h	B.260 utt1	You know, so, I mean I don't know,
sv	B.260 utt2	I think that if the people are not forced to do it they may not, {D you, know. }
b	A.261 utt1	Yeah.
o@	A.261 utt2	It d , , Well, you know, if they're forced to do it it becomes sort of a habit.
h	B.262 utt2	I mean, I don't know,
sv	B.262 utt3	I think a lot of people still will,
o@	B.262 utt4	but , Right.
sd	A.265 utt1	You know, I know that it's really funny.
sd	A.265 utt2	My parents are forced to do it
