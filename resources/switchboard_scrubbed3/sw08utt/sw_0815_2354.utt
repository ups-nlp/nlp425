o	A.1 utt1	Okay,
qw	A.1 utt2	what kind of books do you like to read, for enjoyment?
sd	B.2 utt1	mainly, the books I read are, business related, or self improvement.
b	A.5 utt1	Uh huh
sd	B.6 utt2	I've got a, small company on the side that I do things with,
sd	B.6 utt3	so, a lot of the reading that I do has to do with, how can I, do better at my small time business important issues such as a, you know taxes and, business expenses and all those kind things.
qw	A.7 utt1	What kind of business is it?
b	A.9 utt1	Uh huh.
ba	A.11 utt1	Well, that sounds fun .
qw^r	A.13 utt1	What kind of business is it?
sd	B.14 utt1	I've got a, small distributorship,
bk	A.15 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.16 utt1	I, sell a, healthy cookie on the side.
bh	A.17 utt1	Really?
sd	B.18 utt1	And, I have a few health food stores that I send it to.
sd	B.18 utt2	I can buy the cookies in a larger quantity than they can,
b	A.19 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.20 utt1	so I can get a deal from the ma , from the supplier,
ba	A.21 utt1	Well, that's interesting.
sd	B.22 utt1	and then I distributed them
sd	B.22 utt2	and then I get, I can sell them at a cheaper price.
sd	B.22 utt3	Plus I've got a, drinking water system business that I've had on the side for years that I've done.
br^m	A.23 utt1	A what?
sd^r	B.24 utt1	A drinking water business,
x	B.24 utt3	,
bh	A.25 utt1	really?
ny	B.26 utt1	Yeah.
ba	A.27 utt1	Well that sounds interesting .
sd	A.27 utt2	My mom always wants me to open a health food store
sd	A.27 utt3	but, I'm not really into it,
sd	A.27 utt4	I don't know that much about it,
sd	A.27 utt5	so anyway but, well that's interesting.
sv	A.27 utt6	personally, I like mostly
sd	A.27 utt7	if I had a book of my choice, I go to the library a lot
sd	A.27 utt8	and it seems like I always, I never go to the fiction section,
sv	A.27 utt9	I mean that to me is just ridiculous,
sv	A.27 utt10	it's like, life is to interesting to read fiction
b	B.28 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.29 utt2	but I always get books like,
sd	A.29 utt3	I like to quilt,
sd	A.29 utt4	well I'm not into quilting
sd	A.29 utt5	but I check a lot of books out to learn how.
sv	A.29 utt6	I just haven't done it yet because it seems to monstrous to do with a book,
sd	A.29 utt7	but I like to, can and do food preservation,
sd	A.29 utt8	and mostly canning just for fun to go pick the things and just to have fun doing it and to give them as gifts and stuff,
sd	A.29 utt9	and I like to check books out like that
sd	A.29 utt10	and I always come away with,
sd	A.29 utt11	I'm a Christian
sd	A.29 utt12	and I enjoy reading books about
sd	A.29 utt13	I have a real heart for people involved in cults
b	B.30 utt1	Uh huh.
sd^r	A.31 utt1	and, so I have a real, you know, heart for them,
sd	A.31 utt2	and I'm going to bring my Mormon neighbors some Amish bread today
sd	A.31 utt3	and that's just where my heart is
sd	A.31 utt4	so, I read a lot of books on that
sd	A.31 utt5	and, you know Christian books written by people you know to help you out and stuff
sd	A.31 utt6	and I read the Bible.
sd	A.31 utt7	I don't read the Bible as much as I should
sd	A.31 utt8	but I think I would always think that no matter what I did
sd	A.31 utt9	but I do enjoy reading that
sv	A.31 utt10	and, so pretty much we have different interests, I think, in reading,
sd	A.31 utt11	but, and I have a neighbor with a big motorbike
aa	B.32 utt1	Sounds like it.
sd	A.33 utt2	and he likes to run down the street with it
qy^d	A.33 utt3	and you can probably hear him.
h	A.33 utt4	But, I don't know
qy	A.33 utt5	so. Do you enjoy reading anything like that?
ng	B.34 utt1	I haven't really read anything like that in, in years.
sd	B.34 utt2	There was a time when I was really into the home things,
b	A.35 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.36 utt1	and I had my own garden
sd	B.36 utt2	and I did canning, all those kind of things.
sd	B.36 utt3	That was when I was about, ten years younger
br	A.37 utt1	Thirty or younger, Is that what you said?
sd^r	B.40 utt1	About ten years younger,
b^m	A.41 utt1	ten years younger,
ba	A.41 utt2	that's funny.
sv	B.42 utt1	And, the problem that I've had in the past with, my children growing up and moving out of the house and still having three left at home, out of the five,
b	A.43 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.44 utt2	I've tried to devote more time to them and trying to get them interested in reading more and spending more time at the library
sd	B.44 utt4	I've been moderately successful, with my daughter and with my son, they both have different interests in books
b	A.45 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.46 utt2	but, they, they do read them.
sd	B.46 utt3	I have some books on health that I read all the time.
sd	B.46 utt4	One's on vitamins that are good for you and that kind of thing,
bh	A.47 utt1	really?
ny	B.48 utt1	Yeah,
o@	B.48 utt2	I'm, Uh huh.
b	A.49 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.49 utt2	Maureen Solomon . I a friend of mine has a book by her right now called FOODS THAT HEAL.
sd	A.51 utt1	They eat a lot of it,
sd	A.51 utt2	you know, you can take your vitamins
sd	A.51 utt3	and she was telling me to take zinc,
sv	A.51 utt4	so, anyway I've been taking enough zinc, you know to kill a horse probably
sd	A.51 utt5	I hope it doesn't hurt me
sd	A.51 utt6	but, anyway, . I did read one chapter of that .
sd	B.52 utt1	There's a couple called,
h@	B.52 utt2	I'm going to forgot his name now, Dirkson, * forgot = forget
b	A.53 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.54 utt1	and, there's a book called LIFE EXTENSIONS,
qy^d	B.54 utt2	I don't know if you've ever heard of it,
nn	A.55 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.55 utt2	I haven't.
bk	B.56 utt1	Okay.
sd	B.56 utt2	It's a book called LIFE EXTENSIONS.
sd	B.56 utt3	There's also a book called THE LIFE EXTENSION COMPANION,
b	A.57 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.58 utt1	Dirk Pearson and,
sd	B.58 utt2	I forgot Sally's last name, anyway it's a couple.
sd	B.58 utt3	I've seen them on T V,
sv	B.58 utt4	and, they are pretty down to earth about what you can take and what you can't take
o@	B.58 utt5	and, The quantities, what are good for you, what isn't
^2	A.59 utt1	The quantities
qw	A.61 utt1	What's the name of it again?
sd^r	B.62 utt1	LIFE EXTENSIONS.
br^m	A.63 utt1	LIFE EXTENSIONS?
ny	B.64 utt1	yeah,
sd^e	B.64 utt2	he's probably about forty years old now,
b	A.65 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.66 utt1	I saw him probably seven years ago, on Johnny Carson show
b	A.67 utt1	Uh huh.
bh	A.69 utt1	really?
sd	B.70 utt1	and, I was pretty impressed.
sd	B.70 utt2	He had a,
sd	B.70 utt4	before he started out on his experiments he had a battery of tests done on his body to determine the age of each one of his organs you know based on how well it was performing,
b	A.71 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.73 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.74 utt1	and then he embarked on this, vitamin treatment
sd	B.74 utt2	and then every year he had the same tests run,
b	A.75 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.76 utt1	and at the age of thirty two, I think it was, his, heart was that of a fourteen year old
bh	A.77 utt1	Really?
sd	B.78 utt1	and all the rest of his organs were you know, all tested out greatly below his actual age.
sd	B.78 utt2	And, of course, Sally, isn't a very big woman,
b	A.79 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.80 utt1	I mean, you know, she appeared to me to be very petite
sd	B.80 utt2	and she took a horse shoe and turned it into an S,
bh	A.81 utt1	really?
sv	B.82 utt1	and, it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that give you the strength,
sv	B.82 utt2	and, of course, doing Isometric exercises, together they both exercised about five minutes a day, doing Isometrics rather than, you know physical strenuous exercises.
bh	A.83 utt1	Really?
sv	A.85 utt1	I know there's not any food that you can get,
sv	A.85 utt2	and it's grown on good soil hardly anymore,
sd	A.85 utt3	and I know my husband's uncle owns some acreage in, Eastland, Texas, which is in West Texas,
b	B.86 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.87 utt1	and he owns a lot of acreage that's been farmed properly, you know
b	B.88 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.89 utt1	and, we get black eyed peas off of it and stuff
sv	A.89 utt2	but, I know that, you know, the further we go from Adam the worse the food is for you,
sv	A.89 utt3	but God still somehow makes us all be able to still live.
sv	A.89 utt4	I think it's a miracle we're all still alive after so many generations,
sd	A.89 utt5	well the last couple of processed foods,
h	A.89 utt6	you know, I mean, but, I don't know.
sd	A.89 utt7	I like to,
sd	A.89 utt9	I like to be able to eat really healthy,
o@	A.89 utt10	you know, and , I guess I'm going to have to wait for the millennium, I think though because I don't think we're going to restore the earth to,
b	B.90 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.91 utt2	you know, I think Jesus is the only one that can make this earth be restored to what it should be,
sd	A.91 utt3	but, in the meantime we pray over our food because I'm always looking down my plate
sd	A.91 utt4	and I think man this stuff was probably grown in who knows what, you know, kind of environment
sd	A.91 utt5	but I do take some vitamins on the side
sd	A.91 utt6	and, I do like reading books like that I have a hard time, a lot of the books are real new age oriented like Mother Earth
sd	A.91 utt7	and we're going to restore the earth.
sd	A.91 utt8	I just don't see that.
sv	A.91 utt9	I mean, I think to think that is almost,
sv	A.91 utt10	it's hopeless to think that man can do anything with the,
qy	A.91 utt11	you know what I'm saying?
ny	B.92 utt1	Yes.
sv	A.93 utt2	and I think God's in charge
sv	A.93 utt3	and God's going to restore it when he wants to
sd	A.93 utt4	so sometimes I get bogged down you know, in the ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of vitamin taking,
sd	A.93 utt5	but, you know there's a balance in it sometimes I read stuff like that
sd	A.93 utt6	and then I just chunk off like water off your back, some of it,
sd	A.93 utt7	you know, and try and do what I can do out of it that's practical,
b	B.94 utt1	Yeah,
o@	A.95 utt1	but, anyway,
sd	B.98 utt1	I've read a lot of things, since I got involved in the water business back in eighty three,
b	A.99 utt1	Uh huh
sd	B.100 utt1	and it's amazing that the legislation they have, for food that doesn't apply to water,
sv	B.100 utt2	they don't consider water a food
b	A.101 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.102 utt1	and, the basics premise is that if water was a food you know, they wouldn't be able to sell it to you through your pipes because it's toxic . chlorine,
br^m	A.103 utt1	Because it's what?
sv^r	B.104 utt1	It's toxic.
b	A.105 utt1	Oh.
qy^d	B.106 utt1	I don't know if your on city water,
sd	B.106 utt2	city water has chlorine in it,
sv	B.106 utt3	chlorine, causes cancer,
b	A.107 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.109 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.110 utt1	they know that,
sv	B.110 utt2	they've proven that.
sv(^q)	B.110 utt3	yet their saying well we're putting such low doses in there, that, well, you don't have to worry about dying from it.
b	A.111 utt1	Uh huh
sv	B.112 utt2	The problem is that I've read books that, have proven that there is a link between the ingestation of chlorine and arteriosclerosis, which is heart attack,
b	A.113 utt1	Uh huh
sv*	B.116 utt1	and if you look at the history of hear attacks, heart attacks were nonexistent prior to nineteen twenty, / * typo hear > heart
bh	A.117 utt1	Really?
sd	B.118 utt1	and we started doing, large quantities of chlorination of water starting around, where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water.
bh	A.119 utt1	Really?
sv	A.119 utt2	You know I bet that's why we have some friends that eat only,
sd	A.119 utt3	I just took this Amish bread out of the oven,
sd	A.119 utt4	man, it's going to be good.
sd	A.119 utt5	I had a starter that friend of mine made,
sd	A.119 utt6	anyway, I had a friend that read a book on that
sd	A.119 utt8	all my relatives my m ,
qy^d	A.119 utt9	you know, you probably read BACK TO EDEN or something,
h	A.119 utt10	I don't know,
sd	A.119 utt11	we read a lot,
sd	A.119 utt12	I know people have read all those books
sd	A.119 utt14	they drilled a well, I don't know how many feet
sd	A.119 utt15	but it's three or four times deeper than it needed to be,
b	B.120 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.121 utt1	and so their water comes out,
sd	A.121 utt2	they live in Grand Prairie,
sd	A.121 utt4	they live kind of in the planes go right over from D F W,
sd	A.121 utt5	so it's not real developed,
sd	A.121 utt6	and so they have probably half an acre,
b	B.122 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.122 utt2	I'm very familiar with the area.
sd	A.123 utt3	and they drilled this well
sd	A.123 utt4	and the water comes out at thirty two degrees,
sd	A.123 utt5	so it's kinds of neat.
qy	A.123 utt6	Would that be healthier to do that, to drill your own fresh water well like that?
^h	B.124 utt1	It depends, a lot of things were thought that, as,
sv(^q)	B.124 utt2	you know, the farmers thought, okay, we got chemicals, we're putting chemicals on the field,
^q	B.124 utt3	well the ground will naturally filter out the ...
