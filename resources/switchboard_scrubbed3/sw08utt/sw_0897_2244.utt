sd	B.2 utt5	and, we like to have barbecues outside you know, when the weather's nice because in Texas you have a lot of nice weather,
sd	B.2 utt6	so, we do a lot of, things like that.
sd	B.2 utt7	I'm not really into gourmet cooking,
sd	B.2 utt8	so, I don't know how to do that,
sd	B.2 utt9	so, I don't have gourmet foods .

sd^e	B.4 utt2	you know, like fajitas and stuff like that,
b^m	A.5 utt1	fajitas,
qw	A.5 utt2	how do you make fajitas?
sd	B.6 utt1	it's kind of like made out of skirt steak
sd	B.6 utt2	and you marinate it.
b	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.8 utt1	You can buy marinating mixes here
sd	B.8 utt2	I don't know, get it up there.
b	A.9 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.10 utt2	you can, you know, marinate it in any kind of barbecue sauce you like
sd	B.10 utt3	and then you quick fry it real fast in hot grease. You know, not, not deep frying it
sd	B.10 utt4	but you can either barbecue it which is really good, with, green peppers and red peppers and onions.
o@	A.11 utt1	Oh. Uh huh.
sd	B.14 utt1	And, then you put it on a flour, like, you know,
sd	B.14 utt2	you make your meat real, thin, you know, bite size pieces.
b	A.15 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.16 utt1	Then you put it on flour tortillas with, you know, guacamole and, sour cream and, you know, all kinds of, you know,
sd	B.16 utt2	it's like a Tex Mex type thing.
ba	A.17 utt1	it sounds good.

sd	B.18 utt2	You can do it with chicken too.
sd	B.18 utt3	Chicken fajitas and stuff.
b	A.19 utt1	Okay.
ba	A.21 utt1	Well, that's nice.
qw	B.22 utt1	So, what kind of cooking do you do up there?
sd	A.23 utt1	well, basically, because I lived in the Middle East for a while I tend to fix Middle Eastern foods when I have, have people over.
o@	B.24 utt1	 that sounds interesting.
sd	A.27 utt1	And so, some of the dips are like chick peas mashed with, sesame.
b	B.28 utt1	Uh huh.
t1	A.29 utt2	what's it called,
sd	A.29 utt3	I forgot, , what it's called,
qy^d	B.32 utt1	You cook them so often you kind of forget their names.
na	A.33 utt1	That's right,
na^r	A.33 utt2	that's right.
b	B.34 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.34 utt2	yeah.
sd	A.35 utt1	It's called ,
sd	A.35 utt2	now I remember it.
b	B.36 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.37 utt1	And, dipping Arabic bread, the thin piece of bread in that.
b	B.38 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.39 utt1	Or another dip is very similar but with, eggplant which has been actually barbe ,
sd	A.39 utt2	it ends up with a barbecued taste.
sd	A.39 utt4	although we usually bake it in the oven
sd	A.39 utt6	those of us that have gas stoves bake it on top just like putting it in the gas flame and sort of getting it black, on the outside but mushy on the inside.
b	B.40 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.42 utt1	that's unusual I'd never heard of anything like that, you know.
sd	B.44 utt1	Here in Texas it's all, you know, Tex Mex cooking and barbecue
o@	B.44 utt2	and, they're really big on stuff like that
qy	A.47 utt1	But barbecue is it like steaks
qrr	A.47 utt2	or is it, turkey?
b	B.48 utt1	Yeah,
br	B.50 utt1	Pardon me?
qr	A.51 utt1	Would you barbecue a turkey or a chicken
ny	B.52 utt1	yeah,
sd^e	B.52 utt2	you can barbecue turkey if you have a big enough grill
sd	B.52 utt3	but I cook my turkeys inside, you know,
sd	B.52 utt5	you can buy smoked turkeys.
b	A.53 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.54 utt1	or, but most the stuff that we barbecue is like steak and chicken and hamburgers, hot dogs, you know,
b	A.55 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.56 utt2	the simple things like that,
o@	B.56 utt3	and, you know, we like things like that.
b	A.57 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.58 utt2	You know, barbecue beans and baked beans
b	A.59 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.59 utt2	I'm sure that the chicken that we barbecue from the Middle East has a lemon garlic sauce.
sd	A.59 utt3	I wouldn't imagine that a barbecued chicken would.
nn	B.60 utt1	No,
nn^r	B.60 utt2	no,
sd^e	B.60 utt3	this is more like hickory type, you know,
b	A.61 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.62 utt1	depending on the barbe ,
sd	B.62 utt2	it's like a smokey flavor, if you've ever, you know, had stuff like that.
b	A.63 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.64 utt3	it's totally different.
sd	B.64 utt4	Sounds like it would be interesting to eat some of the Middle Eastern cooking,
