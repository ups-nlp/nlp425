o	A.1 utt1	Okay,
qy^t	A.1 utt2	you ready to discuss the topic?
qw^t	B.2 utt1	What's the topic?
b	A.3 utt1	Okay,
sd^t	A.3 utt2	the topic is social changes and discuss social changes in America and how they relate, or how they differ today than they were ten, fifteen or thirty years ago.
b	B.4 utt1	Okay.
qy^t	A.5 utt1	You ready for that?
na	B.6 utt1	You bet.
b	A.7 utt1	Okay .
cc	B.8 utt1	I'll let you lead out.
br	A.9 utt1	Pardon me?
cc^r	B.10 utt1	I'll let you lead out.
aa	A.11 utt1	Okay,
sd^t	A.11 utt3	it's kind of an interesting topic
sv	A.11 utt4	and one that I think is quite fascinating because, couple of years ago, I guess,
sv	A.11 utt5	not very long ago, seemed like the whole world, not just the United States, but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in, you know, a very comfortable position, so to say, even though the cold war was in full swing. You know,
sd	A.11 utt6	you had the, the Russians against the Americans, the Communists against the Free World,
sd	A.11 utt7	and in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically, not only on the political front but also on the economic front, where, couple of years ago America was one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned,
sd	A.11 utt8	and now we're having a very tough time in a recessionary period.
sd	A.11 utt9	We're also have a very humongous trade deficit,
sv	A.11 utt10	and that's kind of frightening.
sv	A.11 utt11	Also, you know, a couple of years ago, fifteen, ten, fifteen years ago, an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life,
sd	A.11 utt12	and thirty years ago, that was basically it, whereas now we're expected to have a career change you know, every couple of years and possibly fi , four to five career changes throughout our lifetime,
sv	A.11 utt14	there's been an awful lot of social change lately,
sv	B.12 utt1	I think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes is that they seem to be economically driven also.
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.15 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.16 utt1	So if you look at Russia and what's happened over there, I think the change in Communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing.
sd	B.16 utt2	And, of course, I look at the economic problems in the United States right now.
qh	B.16 utt3	One of the things you wonder is what that's going to do to us.
aa	A.17 utt1	True.
sv	B.18 utt1	I think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things, I mean, I think it's great to even have three or four different careers in your life.
b	A.19 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.20 utt2	I think it must have been terribly boring to go through, your life doing just one thing for fifty years or forty years.
aa	A.23 utt1	Yes,
aa^r	A.23 utt2	yes.
sv	B.24 utt1	Some of that opportunity for job change in the fact that aspects changing.
aa	A.25 utt1	True,
aa^r	A.25 utt2	true.
sv	B.26 utt1	And the uncertainty of whether you're going to have a job is not as good,
sv	B.26 utt2	but, the fact that you really can make major changes in your life and jobs.
b	A.27 utt1	Uh huh.
qr	A.29 utt1	Well, do you think that's good or bad?
sv	B.30 utt1	I think it's great.
b^m	A.31 utt1	You think that's great.
aa	B.32 utt1	yeah.
sv	A.33 utt3	because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position,
sv	A.33 utt4	they're very comfortable,
sv	A.33 utt5	they lose the ability to learn,
sv	A.33 utt6	and they in a sense become unteachable.
sv	A.33 utt7	They think they know all there is to know in the area, set path, and you know, come in and put my time in from nine to five,
sv	A.33 utt8	and when that's over with, that's it, without even giving a second thought to , advancing their education or getting extracurricular, education,
sv	A.33 utt9	and I think that's an excellent opportunity for us to expand ourselves also.
sv	B.34 utt1	I think one of the problems with education as it relates to this, though, is that I don't know that education is prepared to help people make those changes.
sv	B.36 utt1	It just seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession and not giving them the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes, which I think is going to be a hard thing for people to face.
b	A.37 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	A.39 utt1	Right.
aa	A.39 utt2	I agree with that,
aa^r	A.39 utt3	I agree with that.
sv	A.39 utt4	But I believe that, an individual should really learn how to learn
b	B.40 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.41 utt1	learn how to adapt,
sv	A.41 utt2	learn how to grow in their college or whatever education they might take.
sd	A.41 utt3	Well, that's good,
sd^r	A.41 utt4	that's good.
sv	B.42 utt1	There probably needs to be some training on how to, to adjust to these changes as they come about.
sv	B.44 utt1	I mean if you look at the high unemployment rate right now
sv	B.44 utt2	and you look at people who are in those situations, I don't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them, even ideas of how to make those changes now.
b	A.45 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.46 utt1	So it seems to me that while those changes are taking place, maybe we're not well preparing people to make the changes with them.
b	A.47 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.47 utt2	I read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress, for those people that are laid off and also for those people that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now.
b	B.48 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.49 utt1	That stress is a very prominent factor in the work place
