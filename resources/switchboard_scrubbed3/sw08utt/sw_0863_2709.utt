sd	B.2 utt1	Well, I'll tell you why I feel so,
sd^t	B.2 utt2	I feel strongly about this topic.
sd	B.2 utt3	I don't know a whole lot about the immigration laws.
sd	B.2 utt4	But I do know that in the, where I live and I teach school, there are so many Orientals that have come here
sd	B.2 utt5	and there's a lot of Mexican people too. Which is not, neither here nor there,
sv	B.2 utt6	but the fact is that all the Orientals that are here are very affluent, very wise in money matters and have taken over a lot of businesses,
sv	B.2 utt9	it's kind of scary because they're so bright.
sv	B.2 utt10	all the kids that I have that are Oriental are really far above the American kids.
sv	B.2 utt12	and the parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up.
sv	B.2 utt13	And money is their main goal.
sv	B.2 utt14	And it really is kind of scary because there's just oodles of them.
sv	B.2 utt15	And you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by Orientals.
sv	B.2 utt16	And it's kind of scares me, not that I don't want them here and not that I don't appreciate the fact you know, that they have rights too.
sv	B.2 utt17	But on the other hand, you feel like almost they're invading us to the point where they're going to take over .
aa	A.3 utt1	Right.
sd(^q)	A.3 utt2	Actually my son once said that, perhaps, what we should do is buy a little square of land some place in the Midwest.
sv	A.3 utt3	and that might be the solution .
aa	B.4 utt1	I think probably that's, a good idea. Because I lived in Iowa for about ten years before I came here.
b	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.8 utt2	And I was born in Ohio,
b	A.9 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.10 utt2	and there are a lot of Mexican people here because we're so close to the border.
b	A.11 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.12 utt1	and they are wonderful people
sd	B.12 utt2	and you know, I don't want to deny them their rights.
sv	B.12 utt3	Just that you, you feel like when you were born and raised here and you worked very hard to make this country what it is, it scares you when you feel like somebody's taking over.
sv	B.12 utt4	And a lot of these people plan one day to go back, you know, to Vietnam or to, you know, Taiwan or wherever they're from. And take with them a lot of American dollars plus a lot of power in American com , companies.
sv	B.12 utt5	And it's kind of scary .
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	A.13 utt2	uh huh.
h	B.14 utt1	And, you know, I don't know,
sd	B.14 utt2	I don't know the immigration laws that
h	B.14 utt3	well and I do not,
sd	B.14 utt4	and in fact I don't know them at all.
sd	B.14 utt5	I don't know how many people they allow in the United States per year or if there's even a,
sd	B.14 utt6	I don't even know if there is a number that they allow in anymore.
qy	B.14 utt7	Do you know anything about that?
nn	A.15 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.15 utt2	I don't,
h	A.15 utt3	I don't know.
sd	A.15 utt4	I lived in the Middle East for sometime
sd	A.15 utt5	and I do believe there must have been some sort of quota system because, I know a lot of people that in a sense, not, qualified is the wrong word, certainly were deserving to come.
b	B.16 utt1	Oh.
b	B.18 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.19 utt1	And it seemed to take them a long time
sd	A.19 utt2	or there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether they would be able to come .
b	B.20 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.21 utt1	And so I would guess that, you know, there are quotas for different places.
aa	B.22 utt1	I would think so too.
sv	A.23 utt1	You know, I, I think there's something about being able to claim, imminent danger
sd	A.23 utt2	or, I'm not sure what the terminology is.
b	B.24 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	B.24 utt2	uh huh.
sv	A.25 utt1	Maybe political a ,
^2	B.26 utt1	Asylum, of some sort.
aa	A.27 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.27 utt2	there you go.
aa	A.27 utt3	You got the term.
b	B.28 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.29 utt1	And maybe that's an issue with a lot of people.
h	A.29 utt2	I don't know.
o@	A.29 utt3	But, Yeah,
o@	B.30 utt1	Well, Well, I teach in the suburb of Dallas
sd	A.31 utt2	I guess I haven't been in a situation where it's been threatening to me.
sd	B.32 utt2	and, my kids go to school in another suburb of Dallas. with very, very good school systems.
sd	B.32 utt3	And they're considered, you know one of the top three in the state. Both of them, you know.
b	A.33 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.34 utt1	And it seems like a lot of the Orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools.
b	A.35 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.36 utt1	And they're head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here.
sd	B.36 utt2	And the kids in this area are very bright. And come from, you know, parents that are professionals or semiprofessionals and, very interested in their education.
sv	B.36 utt3	But, I think in the, last year, if I'm not mistaken, in four of the six high schools, the graduating class valedictorian and salutatorian were, half or more Oriental.
b	A.37 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	A.37 utt2	uh huh.
sd	B.38 utt1	And, you know, they're just extremely bright kids.
sd	B.38 utt2	And also they value learning.
sv	A.39 utt1	I was going to say, I would guess that it's not that they are any brighter,
sv	A.39 utt2	but they just maybe work harder
sv	B.40 utt1	Well, I think things come easy for them too.
sv	B.40 utt2	But I do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the United States.
sv	B.40 utt3	they, don't want to work for anything.
sv	B.40 utt4	They want it to come to them and be there
sv	B.40 utt5	but they don't want to work hard.
sd	B.40 utt6	And these kids work really hard.
b	A.41 utt1	Right,
b^r	A.41 utt2	right.
sd	B.42 utt1	and they have,
sv	A.43 utt1	but maybe part of that's the problem that here we've let this value slip.
aa	B.44 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.44 utt2	I know,
aa	B.44 utt3	I agree with that.
sv	A.45 utt1	And they need to have some competition.
sv	B.46 utt1	But what I see is y ,
sd	B.46 utt2	the competition is there,
sv	B.46 utt3	but instead of meeting the challenge, they're starting to resent them.
b	A.47 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.48 utt1	And it's causing, you know, I think some problems.
sv	A.49 utt1	Well, that's too bad.
aa@	B.50 utt1	It really is. Because we see a lot of racial problems in the Dallas area anyway, especially in Dallas.
b	A.51 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.53 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.54 utt2	And it's mainly Black and, and Hispanic.
b	A.55 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	A.55 utt2	uh huh.
sd	B.56 utt1	But, there has been some resentment with Orientals in the Black community because they've started businesses there,
sv	B.56 utt2	and the Blacks resent them coming in and taking their money,
sd	B.56 utt3	and there's been some violence because of it.
sv	A.57 utt1	that's really sad.
aa	B.58 utt1	It is.
aa^r	B.58 utt2	it is very sad.
b	A.59 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.60 utt2	I've, I've always prided myself on not being prejudiced and you know, welcoming everyone that wants to come here.
b	A.61 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.62 utt2	And even when I was younger when I was in college, I was a member of the N A A C P because I lived up north,
sd	B.62 utt3	and I was very into the human rights part of everything.
b	A.63 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.64 utt1	But I've, I've become very cynical in the last three, four years living in Texas.
b	A.65 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.67 utt1	Well, and it sounds like you feel that there is need for change.
sv	A.67 utt3	there is too big of a concentration coming all at once to allow for adequate melting into the society.
aa	B.68 utt1	Uh huh,
aa^r	B.68 utt2	uh huh.
aa	B.68 utt3	Well, and exactly,
aa	B.68 utt4	that's exactly true.
sv	B.68 utt5	Plus the fact that these people do come for a short period of time. Two, two, three, four maybe five years and then go back. And pick our brains, which is wonderful, and take all that back with them.
sv	B.68 utt6	and, plus a lot of American dollars.
sv	B.68 utt7	But in the long run maybe that's going to make a better world too.
aa	A.69 utt1	Right.
sv	B.70 utt1	You know, you just don't know.
aa	A.71 utt1	Exactly.
sd	B.72 utt3	there's somebody on my other line
sd	B.72 utt4	but I'm going to ignore that.
b	A.73 utt1	Oh.
sv	B.74 utt3	you kind of, you don , you really don't know what to do.
sd	B.74 utt4	and I don't,
sd	B.74 utt5	I want my kids to have values where they're accepting and so forth.
b	A.75 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.76 utt1	And both of my children are really more tolerant of Blacks and Hispanics than they are of the Orientals, for some reason.
sd	B.78 utt2	They feel, you know, like they've taken over.
sd	B.78 utt3	They feel like, you know, they're taking some of the rewards that they should have.
b	A.79 utt1	Right.
sd	B.80 utt1	And I really don't want that to happen.
b	A.81 utt1	Right,
sd	B.82 utt1	But, but it's happening.
b	A.83 utt1	right.
b	A.85 utt1	Right.
sd	B.86 utt1	And I think a lot of their friends feel the same way too.
b	A.87 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	A.87 utt2	uh huh.
sd	B.88 utt1	and I really do wish I knew about quotas and really wish I
sd@	B.88 utt2	I really do wish I knew more about immigration laws because I have no idea any more. Because they've changed a great deal.
b	A.89 utt1	Right.
aa	A.91 utt1	I would suspect that they have.
sd	A.91 utt2	Well, I guess, I don't have much, much more to contribute to the topic.
b	B.92 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.92 utt2	I don't really either.
sd	B.92 utt3	I wish I knew more.
b	A.93 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.94 utt1	Probably if I did, I might be a little bit more, tolerant, perhaps.
b	A.95 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.96 utt3	and even if I really wish I knew the situations they were going back to or coming from.
b	A.97 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.98 utt1	You don't know any of that
sv	B.98 utt2	and you feel, you know, you can't put yourself in their shoes or really understand them.
b	A.99 utt1	Right.
sv	B.100 utt2	and for some reason Orientals are very,
sd	B.100 utt3	my good friend calls them pushy,
sd	B.100 utt4	but I call them very, that
sv	B.100 utt5	they know what they want
sv	B.100 utt6	and they go get it.
b	A.101 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.102 utt1	And in stores and so and so forth it's, wh ,
bf	A.103 utt1	Goal directed.
b^r	B.104 utt2	pardon me?
bf^r	A.105 utt1	Goal directed.
aa	B.106 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.106 utt2	But in stores and things, sometimes they can be very impolite because they get in front of you or they take something that you had in mind to get before you did.
b	A.107 utt1	Oh.
ba	A.107 utt2	I see.
sd	B.108 utt2	You know, just going for it, they take it quickly.
b	A.109 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.110 utt1	And, they don't think anything of that.
h	B.110 utt2	And I don't, you know,
sv	B.110 utt3	that's makes people resentful too.
sv	B.110 utt4	And so, And yet they have a right to be here
aa	A.111 utt1	Sure,
aa^r	A.111 utt2	sure.
sd	B.112 utt2	and I know that.
b	A.113 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.114 utt1	But it sometimes it's gets touchy.
b	A.115 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	A.115 utt2	uh huh.
sd	B.116 utt1	and I'm sure it's a lot different,
qy^d	B.116 utt2	you're from Maryland, You said?
ny	A.117 utt1	Yes,
qw	B.118 utt2	What part of Maryland are you from?
sd	A.119 utt1	Up in the Gaithersburg area.
bk	B.120 utt1	okay.
sd	B.120 utt2	My sister used to live there, in that area.
b	A.121 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.122 utt2	And I'm sure that it's a lot different there.
sv	B.122 utt3	it's a lot different than, in Iowa than it is here.
ar	A.123 utt1	Well, no.
sv@	A.123 utt2	I think as I recall in my son's class, there were an awful lot of minorities. And, of all varieties.
qh	B.124 utt1	Is that right?
sd	A.125 utt2	And with you know, some of the, some of the same problems that you've mentioned.
h	A.125 utt3	But, I don't know,
sd	A.125 utt4	I guess I wasn't involved enough to, really stop to think about it.
b	B.126 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.126 utt2	Well, you know, since I teach, I see it.
sd	B.126 utt4	and I love the example that most of these children give our American children.
sd	B.126 utt5	And yet, you know, I can see why some of the parents that are fearful too.
b	A.127 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	A.127 utt2	uh huh.
sd	B.128 utt1	and it's a kind of a touchy situation.
b	A.129 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.130 utt1	And I wish that we could all just learn from each other and not feel threatened.
sv	B.130 utt2	But it doesn't happen that way all the time.
aa	A.131 utt1	Exactly,
aa^r	A.131 utt2	exactly.
aa	A.133 utt1	Right,
aa	A.135 utt1	right.
b	B.136 utt1	So anyway,
fc	A.137 utt1	Well, it was good talking to you.
fc^m	B.138 utt1	It was good to talk to you too.
fc	B.140 utt1	And have a good trip in California.
fc	A.141 utt1	Okay.
fc	A.141 utt2	And have a good weekend.
fc	B.142 utt1	All right.
fc	B.142 utt2	Well thank you.
fc	A.143 utt1	all righty,
fc	B.144 utt1	Bye bye.
fc^m	A.145 utt1	Bye bye .
