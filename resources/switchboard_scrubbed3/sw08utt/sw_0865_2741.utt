o	B.1 utt1	Okay.
o	A.2 utt1	All righty.
sv@	A.2 utt2	I think one of the most significant changes that have happened is that they've changed from homemaker to the work market. And for several reasons.
b	B.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.4 utt2	Probably some of that is divorce
sv	A.4 utt3	and some is they're more educated than they used to be I think.
b	B.5 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.6 utt1	I think sometimes, leaders in government they've become more, adroit in that area, too, instead of just men all the time.
b	B.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.8 utt1	We have more women in government.
b	B.9 utt1	Uh huh.
ad	A.10 utt1	And, now I'll let you say something .
sd	B.11 utt1	Well, I probably a little bit older than you are,
^h	B.11 utt2	so what I see, is,
sd	B.11 utt3	the change that I see the most is that, women have many more occupations and careers to choose from than when I went to college.
sd	B.11 utt4	When I went to college you could be a teacher or maybe a nurse or a secretary,
sd	B.11 utt5	but there were very few women in business at that time.
sd	B.11 utt6	A few,
sd	B.11 utt7	but they were the oddity.
o@	B.11 utt8	And, Yes.
^2	A.12 utt1	Very limited.
^h	B.13 utt2	And now I see
sd	B.13 utt3	and I see for my daughter, which is wonderful this,
sd	B.13 utt4	she's thirteen
sd	B.13 utt5	and I see a whole wonderful world out there that she can choose from,
b	A.14 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.15 utt1	so many different jobs, which I think is terrific.
aa	A.16 utt1	Yes.
sd	B.17 utt1	Because I'm a teacher
sd	B.17 utt2	and, I mean, I love teaching,
sd	B.17 utt3	but, I think there are a lot of other things I would have liked better.
b	A.18 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.19 utt1	And, not that I would give the career up because it's a safe career, plus, because I always have a job plus I am a single parent, too,
b	A.20 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.21 utt1	and I need the income.
b	A.22 utt1	Right.
sv	B.23 utt1	and I think that's the reason why a lot of women have started to work, too, is because economically it's just a must.
aa	A.24 utt1	I think that's right.
sv	B.25 utt2	it's very difficult to get along on one income unless , the male, has an extraordinarily good job.
b	A.26 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.27 utt1	And especially men who teach school, they don't make that much money,
sv	B.27 utt3	they always either have
sv	B.27 utt4	they're either moonlighting or else their wife works, too.
b	A.28 utt1	Right.
sv	B.29 utt1	it's just an economic need now.
sv	A.30 utt1	I really think women have so much more responsibility you know, as far as everything.
aa	B.31 utt1	definitely.
sd(^q)	A.32 utt1	And, like you said, women today have so many,
sd	A.32 utt2	the average today of having a single family, you know, with the mother as the head, you know, it just really, so commonplace, nowadays.
b	B.33 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	B.35 utt1	yes,
aa	B.35 utt2	exactly.
sd	B.37 utt1	We have quite a few teachers at our school that are single parents
sd	B.37 utt2	and, the majority is, married couple with children,
b	A.38 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.39 utt2	but still there's a lot more than there used to be.
sv	B.39 utt3	And see you never picture yourself in a situation like this.
sd	B.39 utt4	When I married, I thought I'd be married the rest of my life.
b	A.40 utt1	Right,
b^r	A.40 utt2	right.
sd	B.41 utt1	but I'm really grateful that I went to college.
sd(^q)	B.41 utt2	My mother always said, you know, get an education in case you need one, because my father died when we were,
sd	B.41 utt3	I have a twin sister
sd	B.41 utt4	and we were eleven when he died
sd	B.41 utt5	and she had a nursing degree,
b	A.42 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.43 utt1	and she was able to make it.
sd	B.43 utt2	But, she said you never know what's going to happen
sd	B.43 utt3	and I thank God that I did go to college and got a degree because otherwise I don't know how I would be able to raise my children.
sd	A.44 utt1	You know, isn't that funny, because the same thing happened to us, except I was twelve.
sd	A.44 utt2	And my mother had a nursing degree and was able to make it in her profession,
qh	B.45 utt1	Isn't that something.
qy@	A.46 utt2	isn't that funny? that they were able to do it, you know,
ny	B.47 utt1	Yes.
b	B.49 utt1	Yes.
sv	A.50 utt2	and even today I think the chance for education j , is, is so much, better for all of our girls, and boys, too.
aa	B.51 utt1	yes.
sv	A.52 utt2	but the girls especially.
aa	B.53 utt1	Yeah,
aa	B.53 utt2	I do, too.
sv	B.53 utt3	But I think it needs to continue to change
sv	B.53 utt4	and I think there's still not equality as far as, paychecks for men and women.
sv	B.53 utt5	I think that we still have a long way to go.
^2	A.54 utt1	A lot of things,
aa	B.55 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.55 utt2	And I think by the year two thousand it, we're going to see a lot more changes, hopefully, that women are, you know, able to get the executive jobs, and hold positions that men do because they can do it just as well, you know,
b	A.56 utt1	Right.
sv	B.57 utt2	if they want to dedicate most of their time to that they're, they can do it.
b	A.58 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.58 utt2	And I also think that in the future that, it's going to continue.
sv	A.58 utt3	We're not going to see a lax off of women in the work force.
b	B.59 utt1	Uh uh.
sv	A.60 utt1	I think they're going to stay there
sv(^q)	A.60 utt2	and I think that they're going to, be really responsible and do everything just like, what you said, you know, make the grade and make it so women can be the top people in their, in their field.
aa	B.61 utt1	Exactly.
aa	B.63 utt1	Exactly.
sv	B.63 utt2	And I think that's the way it should be.
sv	B.63 utt3	I think it ,
aa	A.64 utt1	I think so.
sv	B.65 utt1	I mean, not that I think that I'm equal to men because there's a lot of things that men can do that I, could never do strength wise and so forth
b	A.66 utt1	Right.
sd	B.67 utt1	but, also there's some things women can do like have children, that men can't do.
b	A.70 utt1	Right.
sd	B.71 utt2	I don't want to be equal
sd	B.71 utt3	but, I want to be, I want to get what I deserve
sd	B.71 utt4	and I want to be able to be on the same level with them.
sv	B.71 utt5	If I can do a job as well as I man I think I should get the same pay, you know.
aa	A.72 utt1	Exactly.
sd	B.73 utt1	And, And I'm not a women's libber.
aa	A.74 utt1	Exactly.
sd	B.75 utt2	I really am not.
sv	B.75 utt3	But I think that we have just as many rights as they do.
sv	B.75 utt4	And I feel like if there's a qualified woman to do the job and if she's good or better than a man then they should get the job with the same pay.
aa	A.76 utt1	That's right.
sv	A.76 utt2	And I think that is happening more and more.
aa	B.77 utt1	I do, too.
sv	A.78 utt1	I think it's just going to take a little bit longer.
aa	B.79 utt1	I do, too.
aa	B.79 utt2	Definitely .
ba	A.80 utt1	Well, great,
b	A.80 utt2	okay.
fc	B.81 utt1	Well, it was good to talk to you.
fc^m	A.82 utt1	Good to talk to you, Sally.
fc	B.83 utt1	All right.
fc	A.84 utt1	Thanks.
fc	B.85 utt1	Bye bye.
fc^m	A.86 utt1	Bye bye.
