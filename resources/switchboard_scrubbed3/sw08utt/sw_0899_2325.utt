o	A.1 utt1	Okay.
qy	A.1 utt2	So, then, do you keep kids?
qy	A.1 utt3	Is this two year old yours
qrr	A.1 utt4	or do you keep children for other people?
nn	B.2 utt1	No.
sd^e	B.2 utt2	I have two children.
sd	B.2 utt3	I have a two year old and a three and a half year old.
sd	A.3 utt1	that's exactly what I have.
bh	B.4 utt1	Really?
ny	A.5 utt1	Yes.
ba	B.6 utt1	That's wild.
ba	A.7 utt1	I know.
sd	A.9 utt2	my little girl was three and a half in March
sd	A.9 utt3	and my son was two in January.
ba	B.10 utt1	boy.
sd	B.10 utt2	Well, mine was two in March
sd	B.10 utt3	and the three and a half year old will be four in July.
ba	A.11 utt1	That's pretty close.
ba^r	B.12 utt1	So that is pretty close .
b	A.13 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.14 utt1	But I'm home with the kids all day
sd	B.14 utt2	and I have really, tried to make that a priority even though it's financially a big strain on us.
aa	A.15 utt1	Yes,
aa	A.15 utt2	it is.
qy	A.17 utt1	Have you been able to do that all along
na	B.18 utt1	Pretty much,
na^r	B.18 utt2	pretty much.
sd	B.18 utt3	I work part time
sd	B.18 utt4	but, my husband's able, you know, mostly to take care of them when I'm working.
sd	B.18 utt5	So. But, we adopted these two little guys
b	A.19 utt1	Yeah.
ba	A.21 utt1	how neat.
sd	B.22 utt1	and that was another reason why I really wanted to be here because, you know, they have had a couple foster homes already.
qw	A.23 utt1	How old were they when you adopted?
sd	B.24 utt1	The baby was eleven weeks old
sd	B.24 utt2	and his brother was twenty two months.
sv	A.25 utt1	So he probably doesn't remember.
b	A.27 utt1	Oh.
b	B.28 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.29 utt1	Yeah,
aa	A.29 utt2	definitely needed.
ba	A.29 utt3	Well, pretty interesting.
sd	A.29 utt4	Well, I have always wanted to be able to stay home with my kids you know.
b	B.30 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.31 utt2	That was always my dream, you know.
sd	A.31 utt3	I wasn't necessarily a career person
b	B.32 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.33 utt1	but as long as I was single and had to work, I was going to get a good job and do the best I could.
b	B.34 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.35 utt1	And my husband was in the type of business that, you know,
sd	A.35 utt2	it's insurance
sd	A.35 utt3	so you have to build a clientele
sd	A.35 utt4	and by the time we had kids I couldn't quit.
ba	B.36 utt1	boy.
sd	A.37 utt1	And so I haven't been able to quit yet.
sd	A.37 utt2	So I've had to deal a lot with child care
sd	A.37 utt3	and course, we're hoping within, hopefully, the next two years I'll be able to quit and stay home.
b	B.38 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.39 utt1	But, I started out,
sd	A.39 utt2	my best friend kept my kids from the time my daughter was born until she went to work last year in August
ba	B.40 utt1	that's neat.
sd	A.41 utt2	and it worked out pretty good.
sd	A.41 utt3	You know, we had always said from the beginning that if it gets in the way of the friendship then I'll take them somewhere else.
sd	A.41 utt4	You know, the friendship is more important.
b	B.42 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.42 utt2	yeah.
sd	A.43 utt1	And, it was a wonderful experience for my kids because she really loved them, you know.
sd	A.43 utt2	She loved them like they were hers
sd	A.43 utt3	and I I knew, you know,
b	B.44 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.45 utt2	I had good peace of mind.
sd	A.45 utt3	I knew that they were taken care of
sv	B.46 utt1	That's the hardest thing I think, you know to deal with is that people love your, kids.
b	A.47 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.50 utt2	I put, my oldest in a preschool program just for him to have the experience of two mornings a week of being with other kids and starting to learn some taking turns and, you know that kind of thing
b	A.51 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.53 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.54 utt2	and, he was in there for three months when I pulled him out
sd	B.54 utt3	and the teacher had eleven kids.
sd	B.54 utt4	It was excellent, supposedly.
sd	B.54 utt5	The reputation was fantastic for this place.
sd	B.54 utt6	Was supposed to be an excellent school
sd	B.54 utt7	and I had several friends who had recommended it, too.
sv	B.54 utt8	But it really gets down to the particular teacher.
sd	B.56 utt1	And she was a new teacher at the school
sd	B.56 utt2	and she had eleven, you know, three year olds in a room
sv	B.56 utt3	and I just think it was way too much.
sd	B.56 utt4	The were almost all boys.
qy	A.57 utt1	But she had no help?
br	B.58 utt1	Pardon?
qy^r	A.59 utt1	She had no help?
qy^d	A.59 utt2	She was alone with them.
na	B.60 utt1	I didn't think much.
na^r	B.60 utt2	I don't think much.
ba	A.61 utt1	that is hard.
b	B.62 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.62 utt2	And she was just my,
sd	B.62 utt3	three year old is real active.
b	A.63 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.64 utt1	And she just kept saying how wild he was.
sd	B.64 utt2	Well, you know, there was kind of a connotation there of you know, it being a problem.
sd	B.64 utt3	Like he ran back from the bathroom singing and skipping she said.
sv	B.64 utt4	Well, you know, at three years old I don't find that to be a behavioral problem . You know .
ba	A.65 utt1	Jeez.
aa	A.67 utt1	I don't either .
sv	B.68 utt2	I mean, it's kind of like there was so much going on that she felt like she needed to control more
b	A.69 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.70 utt1	and it's really hard to con ,
sv	B.70 utt2	you can't control eleven three year olds with one person, you know.
^2	A.71 utt1	You have to let them have some wild time if that's considered wild .
aa	B.72 utt1	Yeah, you know.
sd	B.74 utt1	So I just finally took him out. Plus financial reasons.
b	A.75 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.76 utt1	It was expensive.
sd	B.76 utt2	But I was real careful and visited and everything ahead of time.
sv	B.76 utt3	But I still felt like even after all the checking I did, you know, you really can't know everything about what's going to happen.
sd	B.78 utt2	I felt safe that the kids weren't going to be left alone somewhere in a room where a teacher could do something inappropriate with them, you know, because there was enough classrooms close together that it was like a house with different classrooms.
b	A.79 utt1	Right.
sd	B.80 utt2	And I felt like that was a big factor for me.
b	A.81 utt1	Right.
sd	B.82 utt2	That they would would be safe you know, from any kind of abuse or that kind of thing.
b	A.83 utt1	Yes.
b	A.85 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.87 utt1	Well, when my friend decided to go back to work, and whenever we had problems, it worked out okay because she would come and tell me
sd	A.87 utt2	and we'd work it out.
b	B.88 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.89 utt1	After that, I found another girl that had gone to church with us that, you know, they needed it financially.
sd	A.89 utt2	She had a little boy that was the same age as my little boy
sd(^q)	A.89 utt4	well, you know, we'll try her.
sd	A.89 utt5	But she came to our house
sd	A.89 utt6	and that just did not work.
b	B.90 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.91 utt1	I mean, she loved the kids
sd	A.91 utt2	and she was good with them.
sd	A.91 utt3	But, you know, they were filthy when I'd get home.
sd	A.91 utt4	Now I understand kids go out and play
sd	A.91 utt5	and they get dirty
b	B.92 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.93 utt1	but I mean filthy.
sd	A.93 utt2	I'm talking sand in the ears and the eyes and the hair
ba	B.94 utt1	gosh.
sd	A.95 utt1	and I was, like, gosh.
sd	A.95 utt2	And then, you know, my own furniture and stuff was like, you know,
sd	A.95 utt3	the kitchen table, I'd find peanut butter and jelly all over the table and the chairs
bf	B.96 utt1	You had to come home and clean before you could even do anything probably.
sd	A.97 utt1	and clean,
sd	A.97 utt2	and I was like,
b	A.99 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.99 utt2	And then, in the end, she basically ended up stealing a hundred dollars from me
sd	A.99 utt3	so I had a pretty bad taste in my mouth.
sd	A.99 utt4	She told me about five thirty one afternoon, it was a Friday, that she wasn't keeping kids anymore as of Monday morning.
ba	B.100 utt1	gosh.
sd	A.101 utt1	Well, you know, I work eight to five thirty
qh	A.101 utt2	so what am I supposed to do .
b	B.102 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.103 utt1	So well, I had been sick
sd	A.103 utt3	it ended up that I didn't go to work Monday because I was sick.
sd	A.103 utt4	So I stayed home with them
sd	A.103 utt5	and we went to some of the Kindercares.
b	B.104 utt1	yeah.
sd	B.104 utt2	I took the kids there once just to try it.
sd	B.104 utt3	They had a free day at Kindercare.
b	A.105 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.106 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.107 utt1	Well, that's what they said.
sd	A.107 utt2	There were two pretty near our house
sd(^q)	A.107 utt3	and they said, well, bring them in this week for a free day
sd	A.107 utt4	so I lined up someone Tuesday.
sd	A.107 utt5	They had a Mother's Day Out that my baby sitter took them to, you know, which was fine.
sd	A.107 utt6	They liked it.
sd	A.107 utt7	They had been going to it for years.
b	B.108 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.109 utt1	And so I stayed with them Monday.
sd	A.109 utt2	Tuesday they went to that.
sd	A.109 utt3	Wednesday I took them to one Kindercare.
sd	A.109 utt4	Thursday I took them to another Kindercare
x	A.109 utt5	,
sd	A.111 utt1	and then Friday my husband and I split.
sd	A.111 utt2	But on Thursday I didn't like the Kindercares.
aa	B.112 utt1	I didn't either.
sd	B.112 utt2	I had one bad, I had two bad experiences just that one day with medicine that my son was supposed to have for a cold that they never gave him.
b^m	A.115 utt1	They didn't give him.
sd	B.116 utt1	And the other one was that the younger one got bit really badly by another child
b	A.117 utt1	Oh.
sd@	B.118 utt2	and what they did was they took my younger one out and put him in a crib and left him in a crib the rest of the day. Instead of taking the kid that was biting out and do something with him.
ba	A.119 utt1	that's horrible.
sd	A.121 utt1	And doing something with him.
b	B.122 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.123 utt1	Well, not only was it going to cost me like a hundred and fifty dollars more a month, which I didn't have you know. I, you know,
b	B.124 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.125 utt2	we're a Christian family
sd	A.125 utt3	and, you know, because they're, you know, like public, they're not private you know. They can't pray,
b	B.126 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.127 utt2	they can't talk about God.
sd	A.127 utt3	They can't do anything like that
sd	A.127 utt4	and I don't want them indoctrinated you know,
bf	B.128 utt1	So you feel like your values aren't getting,
b	B.128 utt2	yeah,
b^r	B.128 utt3	yeah.
sd(^q)	A.129 utt2	but I'd like them to be able to say, gee, God made the flowers, you know, and things like that.
b	B.130 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.130 utt2	yeah.
^q	B.132 utt1	God loves you.
b	A.133 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.134 utt1	You know, basic things like that.
b	A.135 utt1	Yeah,
^2	A.135 utt2	basic.
aa	B.136 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.137 utt1	So, I talked to another lady at church.
sd	A.137 utt2	It was like Thursday of that week
sd(^q)	A.137 utt3	and she said I found the most wonderful place that I've been taking my daughter
^q	A.137 utt4	and I've know this girl,
^q	A.137 utt5	I went to college with her
sd	A.137 utt6	so I, I, I value her opinion.
sd	A.137 utt7	And she told me about a private one.
sd	A.137 utt8	it was associated with one of the churches here.
sd	A.137 utt9	It's not the church I go to
sd	A.137 utt10	but you know, it, it was Lubbock View Christian Church
sd	A.137 utt11	and it's a private academy.
b	B.138 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.139 utt1	And so I went over there
sd	A.139 utt2	and I talked to the lady.
sd	A.139 utt3	Well, they have like a three year waiting list.
sd(^q)	A.139 utt4	But she said, I had a mother tell me that she may take a job in San Antonio
sd	A.139 utt5	and she has a three year old and a toddler, which mine was at the time.
b	B.140 utt1	Yeah.
sd(^q)	A.141 utt1	And she said I should know something by tomorrow, which was Friday,
sd(^q)	A.141 utt2	and she said if she leaves, she said, I'll let you have her spot.
ba	B.142 utt1	Wow.
sd	A.143 utt1	And so Friday afternoon at five thirty, she called me
sd(^q)	A.143 utt2	and she said she's going.
^q	A.143 utt3	You can bring your kids Monday .
ba	B.144 utt1	what luck.
ba	A.145 utt1	I know.
sd	A.145 utt2	I was just like, God set this, up for me.
b	B.148 utt1	Really .
sd	A.149 utt1	He knew I needed this
sd	A.149 utt2	so since October then, they have been going there
sd	A.149 utt4	I love it.
sd	A.149 utt5	I have been at such peace with myself.
ba	B.150 utt1	that's great.
sd	A.151 utt2	It's just been better than even when they were with my best friend because we don't have the little day to day hassles
sd	A.151 utt3	and the cost was not near as much as the Kindercares were going to be.
b	B.152 utt1	Yeah
bh	B.154 utt1	really?
ba	B.154 utt2	Wow.
qy	A.155 utt1	Did you hear my printer in the background.
fa	A.155 utt2	I'm sorry.
sd	A.155 utt3	I hope you can understand what I s , .
bd	B.156 utt1	That's okay .
sd	B.156 utt2	I got the dryer going in the background
b	A.157 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.159 utt1	I was only about twenty dollars more a month than I was paying because being a private institution they're nonprofit.
b	B.160 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.161 utt1	So, they don't have to charge as much.
ba	B.162 utt1	that's great.
sd	A.163 utt1	And the hours are wonderful
sd	A.163 utt2	and I think it's the best thing.
sd	A.163 utt3	I told Russ that we should have done this a long time ago you know .
b	B.164 utt1	Yeah.
ba	A.165 utt2	It's great.
sd	A.165 utt3	So I guess as long as I have to work, I feel good that they're there.
sd	A.165 utt4	they're getting the love, the care.
sd	A.165 utt5	They have a little curriculum.
sd	A.165 utt6	They teach them, you know, the alphabet, the numbers, the things which, you know, if they learn, they learn.
sd	A.165 utt7	If they don't, they don't.
sd	A.165 utt8	I don't feel like I have to indoctrinate them by age three
b	B.166 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.167 utt1	but it's kind of neat when they come home with it, you know.
b	B.168 utt1	Yeah.
o@	A.169 utt2	and, Yeah.
bf	B.170 utt1	They think it's fun.
bf	B.170 utt2	It's not a big, you know trauma to them to learn something.
sd	A.173 utt1	and the teachers.
sd	A.173 utt2	Well, Taylor got bit several times
sd	A.173 utt3	and Taylor bit several times
sd	A.173 utt4	and the teachers dealt with that.
sd(^q)	A.173 utt5	We're like, hey they're two
^q	A.173 utt6	and we keep them apart
^q	A.173 utt7	and we scold them
^q	A.173 utt8	and we correct them
sd	A.173 utt9	and, you know, they mark it all down
sd	A.173 utt10	and they let you know
sd	A.173 utt11	and, you know, they get over it real quick
sd	A.173 utt12	and he doesn't do it anymore
sd	A.173 utt13	and they work at the potty train ,
b	B.174 utt1	Yeah.
h	A.175 utt4	I don't know.
sd	A.175 utt5	I just feel like a big burden was lifted .
b	B.176 utt1	Really.
sd	B.176 utt2	Because sometimes it is a burden having them all day because I can't do anything with them here.
aa	A.177 utt1	It is.
sd	B.178 utt2	I can't even go grocery shopping right now with the two of them because the baby is so into everything
ba@	A.179 utt1	I know. I know
sd	B.180 utt2	and the older brother is you know, running around all over the place
sd	B.180 utt3	so it's hard.
sd^m	A.183 utt1	and that's hard.
b	B.184 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.185 utt1	Yeah
b	B.186 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.187 utt3	I, I wish you could find a good Mother's Day Out because that would be good for your peace of mind also.
b	B.188 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.188 utt2	I need to.
sd	B.190 utt1	Even for just a couple mornings a week or something to have something like that,
b	A.191 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.192 utt2	so I think I'm going to look for that.
sd	B.192 utt3	Remind me of that now that you mention it .
sd@	B.194 utt1	I been meaning to do that, you know. Because some of the churches do have them, you know, for like six dollars per child
b	A.195 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.197 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.198 utt1	and that's not that big a deal, you know.
b	A.199 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.200 utt1	For a couple times .
sd	A.201 utt1	And that's usually like, you know,
sd	A.201 utt2	I don't know when mine were going to Mother's Day Out,
sd	A.201 utt3	it was like from nine to three
sd	A.201 utt4	so that was a pretty good pretty good time, you know.
b	B.202 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.203 utt2	My baby sitter would take them and then pick them up.
b	B.204 utt1	Yeah
b	A.205 utt1	So, that worked out real good.
ba	B.206 utt1	That's sounds good.
sd	A.207 utt1	Well, I'm tickled to death.
sd	A.207 utt2	I hope you find something
fc	A.207 utt3	and it was good talking to you.
fc	@B.208 utt1	Well, thanks.
fc	B.210 utt1	Did we cover everything we need to?
fc	A.211 utt1	Well, I guess.
fc	B.212 utt1	Okay.
fc^t	A.213 utt1	It said child care criteria
fc	B.214 utt1	Okay.
fc	A.215 utt1	and I think we both listed an experience .
fc	B.216 utt1	Yeah.
fc	B.216 utt2	Okay.
fc	B.216 utt3	Well, great.
fc	B.216 utt4	Well, thanks a lot.
fc	B.216 utt5	You have a good day.
fc	A.217 utt1	And you too.
fc	B.218 utt1	Bye bye .
fc^m	A.219 utt1	Bye .
