sd	A.1 utt1	Well, I've been thinking I'd love to buy a new car, right now, if I could afford it.
b	B.2 utt1	Oh .
sd	A.3 utt2	But we have two cars right now
sd	A.3 utt3	and we're still paying on them,
sd	A.3 utt4	but I would love to have one of these new mini vans.
sd	A.3 utt5	I've got two little ones
sd	A.3 utt6	and I think that would be just the perfect family car .
sd	B.4 utt2	right now my car is terminally ill
b	A.5 utt1	Oh .
sd	B.6 utt1	so I am really facing the purchase of a car.
sd	B.8 utt1	what I would like to have is so totally impractical for me that, I won't do it.
qw	A.11 utt1	What is it?
sd	B.12 utt1	well, I would like for one time in my life to have a convertible.
b	A.13 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.14 utt1	And, you know, I don't even like the wind blowing in on me
sd	B.14 utt2	so I don't know why I think I want one
sd	B.14 utt3	but I do.
sd	B.16 utt1	I will probably stay with a foreign make.
sd	B.18 utt1	I've had real good luck with them.
b	A.19 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.19 utt3	we went out to buy an American car
sd	A.19 utt4	so we bought, a Chevy Nova about three years ago.
sd	A.19 utt5	and we opened up the hood
sd(^q)	A.19 utt6	and it said Toyota, made in Japan, right across the front of all the engine parts .
bh	B.20 utt1	Is that right?
ny	A.21 utt1	Uh huh.
sd^e(^q)^r	A.21 utt2	Toyota,
sd	A.21 utt3	well, the Chevy Nova is the same car as the Toyota Camry.
sd	A.21 utt4	at that time was the same car
sd	A.21 utt5	so they just put different names on them depending on who they're being shipped to.
sd	B.24 utt1	well, I didn't realize it.
sd	B.24 utt2	I knew that Nissan which is Toyota had a plant over here.
o@	B.24 utt3	and I, didn't know if it was General Motors or who,
sd	B.26 utt2	but I, I never thought of,
b	A.27 utt1	Yeah.
ba	B.28 utt1	I know,
sv	B.28 utt2	you think it's a Chevrolet in the good old U S A
b	A.29 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	A.29 utt2	uh huh.
sd	A.29 utt3	That's why we were so surprised to see Toyota I mean, imprinted on the engine.
sd	A.29 utt4	It was real interesting.
b	B.30 utt1	Huh.
sv	A.31 utt2	with so many options now available, you know, where cars are concerned, it just seems like there's almost too much of a choice anymore.
sd	A.31 utt3	You know, there's so many different options and so many different prices and who has this cash back and whatever.
sv	A.31 utt4	I think that if I were really serious about looking for another car, I would take into consideration the price naturally.
sv	A.31 utt5	But, you know, I would really want something that I would want for that much money. For ten or twelve or fifteen thousand dollars or whatever.
aa	B.32 utt1	Well, yeah,
sv	B.32 utt2	and that's minimum.
aa	A.33 utt1	yea ,
aa	A.33 utt2	definitely .
sd	B.34 utt1	you know it's, it's a major purchase, now.
sv	B.38 utt2	What we used to pay for homes is now what a car, can cost.
sv	A.41 utt1	I cannot imagine that, you know, somebody,
sd	A.41 utt2	I heard a commercial or something about a sixty thousand dollar car about, how, exciting it is to make that kind of a purchase,
sv	A.43 utt2	and I thought, I don't think I'd find that exciting .
sd	A.43 utt3	I'd be wondering, you know, here I am buying this expensive of a car and my house isn't worth that much money .
sv	B.44 utt1	If they held their value, that would be one thing.
aa	A.45 utt1	That's true.
sv	B.46 utt1	But when you consider that when you drive them off of the show lot, they're immediately two thousand dollars depreciated.
b	A.49 utt1	Yeah.
qy	B.50 utt1	And, you know, that,
sd	B.50 utt2	I don't know that, I'll go with,
sd	B.52 utt2	I've bought a new car the last three that I've bought
sd	B.52 utt3	and I don't know that I'll buy a brand new one again.
b	A.53 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.53 utt2	Well, we had a pretty,
sd	A.53 utt3	we bought our Chevrolet brand new
sd	A.53 utt4	and then we bought a used car .
t3	A.53 utt5	Just a minute,
t3	A.53 utt6	I'll change your diaper.
sd	A.55 utt1	Then we bought our next car used
sd	A.55 utt2	and, we had better luck with our used car,
sd	A.55 utt3	and I like it more.
sd	A.55 utt4	It cost us less money
sd	A.55 utt5	and we got more features and air conditioning and whatever on it then we did on our brand new one for twice as much money.
sd	B.56 utt1	Well, I'm seriously considering going that route instead of a brand new car.
sv	A.57 utt1	If you can find one that's you know, reliable .
sv	A.57 utt2	If you can get someone that you trust to buy one from
sv	A.57 utt3	or, you know, make sure that you can have it checked out well enough .
sv@	B.58 utt1	Well, you know, some people have to have a new car every year. Or you know, at the most every two years
ar	A.59 utt1	I wouldn't .
sv	B.60 utt2	and they don't drive them that much.
o@	B.60 utt3	Especially, your foreign cars. You know, like a Honda or, a Toyota.
sv	B.64 utt2	Six thousand is just getting broken in for them.
b	A.65 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.66 utt1	And if I can find one or a repossession.
sd	A.67 utt2	we bought one like that.
sv	B.68 utt1	And with the banks being in such financial, you know, problems now that people,
sv	B.68 utt2	you can find the banks willing to sell you a car.
b	A.69 utt1	Uh huh
sd	A.69 utt4	we bought it real reasonably
sd	A.69 utt5	and it was in real nice condition because apparently whatever the bank get ...
