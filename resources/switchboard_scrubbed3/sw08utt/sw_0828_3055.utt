oo^t	A.1 utt1	And I guess, the suggestion is that we maybe talk about a menu for a dinner party, if we wanted to do something like that or, share recipes or something,
aa	B.2 utt1	Yes,
b	B.2 utt2	uh huh.
b	B.2 utt3	sure.
b	B.4 utt1	Right,
qy	A.5 utt1	Are you one who gives dinner parties very often?
nn	B.6 utt1	No.
nn^m	A.7 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.7 utt2	nor am I.
sd	B.8 utt1	I avoid them with all ,
sv	A.9 utt1	They are a lot of work,
sd	A.9 utt2	that is for sure.
aa	B.10 utt1	Yeah,
aa	B.10 utt2	they are,
sd	B.10 utt3	I mean I do them,
b	A.11 utt1	Yes.
sv^m	B.12 utt1	but they are a lot of work.
b	A.13 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.14 utt1	I usually have them when there is a special event in our lives
sd	B.14 utt2	and I, I make a big deal out of it for them.
b	A.15 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.17 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	A.17 utt2	uh huh.
sd	B.18 utt1	And, I think I am most, happiest with my most, familiar foods that I know are successful.
b	A.19 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.21 utt1	Right,
b	A.21 utt2	yes.
sd	B.22 utt1	You know, and I make my own pies and pie crust
sd	B.22 utt2	and, you know, I can make my pies from scratch,
b	A.23 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.24 utt2	I do not need a recipe to follow.
ba	A.25 utt1	that's great.
sd	A.25 utt2	You sound like my mother who has been,
sd	A.25 utt3	well I bake pies too,
sd	A.25 utt4	but my mother was always the famous pie baker in the family
sd	A.25 utt5	and she has the same technique,
sv	A.25 utt6	I mean, I guess after many years of doing it, you just, kind of do it second nature.
b	B.26 utt1	Yeah,
^2	B.26 utt2	you just know from heart.
sd	B.28 utt1	I had one of the ladies at church that tasted my coconut cream pie
sd(^q)	B.28 utt2	and she said make me one,
sd	B.28 utt3	and I made her one.
sd(^q)	B.30 utt1	And when she gave me back the plate, she said "I did not share this with anybody".
sd	B.30 utt2	And I thought whoa, that was a big pie.
qy^g	A.31 utt1	She enjoyed it, .
ny	B.32 utt1	Yes .
sd	A.33 utt1	Well, there is a woman in our choir, who is nearly famous for her apple pies,
b	B.34 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.35 utt1	and, we had a, an auction one time at the church
sd	A.35 utt2	excuse me, and, one of her pies was auctioned for fifty dollars .
fe	B.36 utt1	My word,
sv	B.38 utt1	she must have a great pie recipe then.
sd	A.39 utt1	Well, I think I have had it once
sd	A.39 utt2	and it has been a few years ago,
sd	A.39 utt3	but I do recall that it was quite good,
ba	B.40 utt1	Wonderful.
b	A.41 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.41 utt2	So, that is her specialty,
sd	A.41 utt3	I like to bake, also,
sd	A.41 utt4	I do not bake so much now that my children are grown,
sd	A.41 utt5	but I do enjoy baking
sd	A.41 utt6	and I guess I always liked making, cookies and bars and things like that,
sd	A.41 utt7	that was more my specialty, I suppose.
b	B.42 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	B.42 utt2	uh huh.
sd	A.43 utt2	And they seem to last longer than pies around here
sv	A.43 utt3	pies would go practically, in a day's time .
b	B.44 utt1	Yeah
aa	B.46 utt1	That's right,
aa	B.46 utt2	yeah
sd	B.46 utt3	they are meant for that evening's, dessert
b	A.47 utt1	Yes.
sd	B.48 utt2	and, you know, it has got to be gone or daddy gets into you know, the leftovers.
b	A.49 utt1	Right .
sd	B.50 utt1	Puts about two more inches on his waistline
sd	B.50 utt2	and then he is chastising, himself afterward .
sd	A.53 utt1	Well, it is interesting that,
sd	A.53 utt2	yesterday, I had lunch with a friend
sd	A.53 utt3	and she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend, for friends of hers.
b	B.54 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.55 utt3	one of her acquaintances, one of her old friends, I guess, had been in town
sd	A.55 utt4	and, they invited two other couples over
sd	A.55 utt5	and so there were seven of them that,
sd	A.55 utt6	I said "well, what did you have"
sd(^q)	A.55 utt7	and she said what she had, just Mexican food,
sd	A.55 utt8	but, you know, she had, guacamole
sd	A.55 utt9	and, I cannot remember all she had.
sd	A.55 utt10	But she also had made, flan, which is actually Spanish, I think.
qy	A.55 utt11	Have you ever made that or had it?
nn	B.56 utt1	No,
sd^e	B.56 utt2	I have not,
nn	B.56 utt3	huh uh.
sd	A.57 utt2	I had, used to work with a gentleman who was from Cuba, who would make it, 
b	B.58 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.59 utt2	it's just a wonderful dessert.
sd	A.59 utt3	It's like, an egg custard in a caramelized sugar, with on top of it.
b	B.60 utt1	okay.
sd	A.61 utt2	And it's actually, not very difficult to make,
sd	A.61 utt3	but it's very, very high in cholesterol, I am sure with all the eggs that are in it.
b	B.62 utt1	Sure,
b	B.62 utt2	yeah.
sd	A.63 utt1	But, she said that she and her husband had, traveled in Spain a couple years ago.
sd	A.63 utt2	and flan is almost, a basic with every meal that you get, there.
bf	B.64 utt1	Like apple pie in America,
qy^d	B.64 utt2	right.
ny	A.65 utt2	Yeah,
ny	A.65 utt3	uh huh.
b	B.66 utt1	Uh huh.
ba	B.66 utt2	Wow,
b	B.66 utt3	uh huh.
sd	A.67 utt1	It's just very customary to get flan.
sd	A.67 utt2	So if you ever run into that you will sort, of be aware of what that is all about.
b	B.68 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.69 utt2	But, I would never have thought of making that as part of a Mexican dinner,
sd	A.69 utt3	but, you know, sopapillas, I guess, would be another kind of a dessert, if you decided to do something like that.
b	B.70 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.71 utt1	flan is something you can, make ahead and you know, have ready
b	B.72 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.73 utt2	but, Well, I would, have been thinking I would like to have a dinner party sometime soon,
sv	A.73 utt7	it's one of those things where it does require some real, planning
aa	B.74 utt1	Yes,
aa	B.74 utt2	uh huh.
sv	A.75 utt2	you don't just make the dinner,
sv	A.75 utt3	you have the house to clean and, you know, the whole business that goes with it.
sd	B.76 utt1	Well, when I have a dinner party that is my motivation for getting the, house clean .
b	A.77 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.79 utt1	Probably a good way to do it.
sd	A.79 utt2	the house needs cleaning, I guess I had better have a dinner party .
b	B.80 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.80 utt2	yeah,
sd	B.80 utt3	we are catering a wedding, in August
sd	B.80 utt4	and, this lady that is,
b	A.81 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.82 utt3	it's at her house,
sd	B.82 utt4	she is not a good housekeeper.
b	A.83 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.84 utt1	So she has got to hire this crew, of four women to come in two weeks prior to the wedding and get it ready.
b	A.85 utt1	Oh.
fe	A.87 utt1	Good heavens .
b	B.88 utt1	Yes,
sd	B.90 utt2	she must have found some jewels, because they start in the corner and work out.
ba	A.93 utt1	wow.
b	B.94 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.95 utt1	That is such a nice thing,
b	B.96 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.97 utt4	my husband and I have been married twenty six years,
sd	A.97 utt5	and until last year I had never had another person clean my house,
sd	A.97 utt6	and, then } I got so involved and so busy, I said "this is one luxury I am going to let myself have every now and then".
b	B.98 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.99 utt2	And so, I had a woman come in, once a month,
sd	A.99 utt3	and you know, it was not just very often,
sd	A.99 utt4	but for me it was wonderful .
b	B.100 utt1	Sure,
b	B.100 utt2	yeah
sd	B.100 utt3	that is nice, you know, to have that,
sv	B.100 utt4	that's a, luxury, today.
aa	A.103 utt1	it is,
sv	A.103 utt2	and it buys you time to do other things, like have a dinner party, I guess.
aa	B.104 utt1	That's right,
aa	B.104 utt2	yeah,
aa^r	B.104 utt3	yeah.
sd	A.105 utt1	So, it is just a real gift of time as far as I am concerned,
b	B.106 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.108 utt1	I have a pie crust recipe that is unique, that has vinegar and egg in it,
b	A.109 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.111 utt1	I have heard about that.
qy	B.112 utt1	Have you?
sd	A.113 utt1	but I have never tried it.
nn	A.115 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.115 utt2	well I should say I have heard of one that has vinegar in it,
sd	A.115 utt3	I do not know that it has egg in it.
bc	B.116 utt1	Egg and sugar.
b	A.117 utt1	uh huh.
b	B.118 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.119 utt1	Do you have it right on the top of you head? .
nn	B.120 utt2	no,
sd^e	B.120 utt3	I think it would be too hazy, because, the,
nn	B.120 utt5	no.
sd	A.121 utt1	You do not have it,
sd	B.122 utt2	like the liquid is like, a half cup of water and then your egg and then your tablespoon of vinegar,
b	A.123 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.125 utt1	Right.
sd	B.126 utt1	and you mix that together
sd	B.126 utt3	see it makes, five pie crusts at once.
ba	A.127 utt1	quite large,
sd	B.128 utt2	it's quite a volume of,
b	A.129 utt1	Right.
sd	B.130 utt1	I think it's four cups of floor,
b	A.131 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.132 utt1	and, like, a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar
sd	B.132 utt2	and, and you combine your dry ingredients
b	A.133 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.134 utt2	and then you, put in your liquid.
b	A.135 utt1	Yeah.
qy	A.135 utt2	what is it about the, the vinegar that, makes, the crust better.
sd	B.136 utt1	It just, it just makes it very pliable and, and very flaky,
ba	A.141 utt1	Interesting.
sd	B.142 utt1	and, you can really treat it rough
sd	B.142 utt2	and you are still going to have a flaky pie crust.
b	A.143 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.143 utt2	yeah,
ba	A.143 utt3	boy, that's the real secret.
sd	B.144 utt1	Like, it's not mine,
sd	B.144 utt2	it was from one of the magazines, probably, twenty years ago
sd(^q)	B.144 utt3	and it said you can throw this on the floor and step on it
sd	B.144 utt4	and, it will still be flaky.
sd	B.146 utt2	I thought, wow, quite a statement for them to make.
sd	A.147 utt2	it makes me think of years ago, when I was visiting my mother in law in, Michigan,
sd	A.147 utt3	she lived very near an apple orchard
sd	A.147 utt5	we could take as many apples as we wanted from it.
sd	A.147 utt7	you know, according to the owners,
sd	A.147 utt8	and so I decided to bake about four pies ahead, you know, and freeze them,
b	B.148 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.150 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.151 utt1	well, talk about working with big amounts of pie crust, and having it be tough.
sd	A.151 utt2	Those were the toughest or apple, pie crust, I have ever, ever made.
ba	B.152 utt1	wow.
b	B.154 utt1	Wow.
sd	A.155 utt1	It was terrible.
sd	A.155 utt2	I could have used that recipe,
sd	@B.156 utt1	Well, I am from Michigan.
qw	A.157 utt1	Where about?
sd	B.158 utt1	Detroit,
b	B.158 utt2	uh huh.
sd	A.159 utt1	Well, we lived in Plymouth for four years,
b	B.160 utt1	yeah,
sd	B.160 utt2	that's real close.
b	A.161 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.161 utt2	In fact, we were there from, seventy three to seventy seven
sd	A.161 utt3	and, I worked for the weekly newspaper there, the, the Plymouth, what was it called, CRIER.
b	B.162 utt1	Uh huh.
ba@	B.164 utt1	how neat. okay.
sd	A.165 utt2	And, my husband is from the upper peninsula,
sd	A.165 utt3	so he was born and, raised up there.
b	B.168 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.169 utt1	That is where my mother in law still lives,
qy	A.169 utt2	so, Are you originally from Michigan
ny	B.170 utt1	yes.
b	A.171 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.172 utt1	Born in Detroit.
fe	A.173 utt1	I will be darn.
