sd	A.2 utt3	and we met, it was my,
sd	A.2 utt4	we usually go to my family reunion,
sd	A.2 utt5	but this one was my husband's
b	B.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.4 utt1	and they're usually quite similar, I think.
qy	B.5 utt1	Are you both from Utah originally?
nn	A.6 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.6 utt2	he's from here
bk	B.7 utt1	uh huh.
sd	A.8 utt1	but, most of his people are from Oregon,
sd	A.8 utt2	so we kind of met halfway
b	B.9 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.10 utt1	and so, this was one,
sd	A.10 utt2	and they, planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin and had, you know,
ba	B.11 utt1	how nice.
sv	A.12 utt2	things like that have to be planned,
sd	A.12 utt3	like they had planned
sd	A.12 utt4	we went to the reunion in end of June and first of July that part the fourth of July weekend,
b	B.13 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.15 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.16 utt2	but we had to plan everything like clear in December, January to reserve that.
b	B.17 utt1	Sure,
b^r	B.17 utt2	sure,
qr	B.19 utt1	Now was this his entire family, cousins, aunts, uncles like that or his immediate family?
b	A.20 utt1	Uh huh.
nn	A.22 utt1	No
ba	B.23 utt1	wow.
sd	A.24 utt1	this was everybody.
ba	B.25 utt1	wow,
qw	B.25 utt2	how many people were there?
sd	A.26 utt1	I, jeez, I think over, three hundred were there.
ba	B.27 utt1	Wow.
sd	A.28 utt2	It was quite a large
ba	B.29 utt1	Wow.
sd	A.30 utt1	it was a great big lodge,
sd	A.30 utt2	and so we had plenty of room and everything,
sd	A.30 utt3	and some of them live in that area,
sd	A.30 utt4	so it wasn't too hard for them to come in the day and leave.
b	B.31 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.32 utt1	But, that was a great big thing,
sd	A.32 utt2	and we do that with his family about every five years, a great big one.
o@	B.33 utt1	that's, wonderful,
sd	A.36 utt1	And then like immediate family like we try to do one thing once a year.
qw	B.37 utt1	Now how many people are in his immediate family?
sv	A.38 utt1	Well, he has eight brothers and sisters
ba	B.39 utt1	wow.
sd	A.40 utt1	so that's big by itself.
ba	B.41 utt1	Wow,
aa	B.41 utt2	it really is,
qy^d	B.43 utt1	and you get together once a year.
ny	A.44 utt1	Yeah.
ba	B.45 utt1	Wow,
sd	A.46 utt1	So we have a little shindig with them.
qy	B.47 utt1	Are they all here in the area,
qrr	B.47 utt2	or are they scattered?
sd	A.48 utt1	 they're in a close proximity.
^h	A.50 utt2	let's see,
sd	A.50 utt3	there are four of them who live here in Texas, and his mom and dad.
b	B.51 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.52 utt1	So, the others live in close neighboring, states, like Nevada, Arizona I think like that,
b	B.53 utt1	Uh huh.
ba	B.55 utt1	wow,
sd	B.55 utt2	that's wonderful.
sd	A.56 utt1	so, it's been fun.
qo	A.56 utt2	How about you?
sd	B.57 utt1	Well, we don't really get together,
sd	B.57 utt2	I would love to,
sd	B.57 utt3	and that's why I checked that I wanted to do that, because I would love to plan a family reunion sometime.
sd	B.57 utt4	I have a sister in Colorado, and, a sister in upstate New York, and a sister in Connecticut, and here I am in Texas.
sd	B.57 utt5	So we're kind of scattered right now.
b	A.58 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.59 utt1	And, my cousins you know, they put on a family reunion, once a year,
sd	B.59 utt2	but it's always like the second week in September,
sd	B.59 utt4	the kids are already back in school
b	A.60 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.61 utt1	and that's back in the
ba	A.62 utt1	That's hard.
sd	B.63 utt1	and that's in New York,
sd	B.63 utt2	and there's no way, I mean there's just no possible way.
b	A.64 utt1	Yeah,
b	A.66 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.67 utt1	And it's not really a weekend,
sd	B.67 utt2	it's just like a day kind of thing, because most of them are, you know,
sd	B.67 utt3	my family moved to Connecticut,
sd	B.67 utt4	the rest of the family stayed in New York and, on Long Island,
b	A.68 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.69 utt2	and so, they're all kind of local and close,
sd	B.69 utt3	and so they just have you know, a day picnic,
sd	B.69 utt4	and, I've always thought it would be so neat, even if it were just my immediate family, to have like a weekend type thing
b	A.70 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.71 utt1	that would be so wonderful .
sd	A.72 utt1	It really is fun,
sd	A.72 utt2	and my mom's family does it once a year, just like you said
b	B.73 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.74 utt1	once a year, they have a, a Wednesday through a Saturday type thing.
sd	A.74 utt2	You can come and go as you please type thing.
ba	B.75 utt1	wow.
sd	A.76 utt1	And they do that once a year.
sd	A.76 utt2	I kind of missed it this year, and felt bad,
sv	A.76 utt3	but you can't go every year,
sv	A.76 utt4	you just cannot do that.
b	B.77 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.77 utt2	yeah,
b	B.79 utt1	Yeah.
qy	B.81 utt1	And do they have a hotel,
qrr	B.81 utt2	or where do you stay?
sd	A.82 utt1	basically, they just stay with each other, brothers or sisters.
sd	A.82 utt2	There are enough in the area to just kind of span yourself out.
^2	B.83 utt1	Take everybody,
sd	A.84 utt1	Whoever's mom and dad it is, you usually go and stay with them,
sd	A.84 utt2	like I go stay with my mother,
sd	A.84 utt3	and my cousins, they just go stay with their mom and dad, you know kind of thing.
b	B.85 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	B.85 utt2	uh huh.
sd	A.86 utt2	And so it's not hard in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one Utah area
b	B.87 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.87 utt2	yeah,
sd	A.88 utt1	so that's not hard,
sd	A.88 utt2	but the real planning, that's the real key
ba	B.89 utt1	that sounds so wonderful,
qh	B.89 utt2	isn't that nice.
b	B.91 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.92 utt1	and they send out,
sd	A.92 utt2	my mom's family now,
sd	A.92 utt3	this is the first reunion with my husband's family I've really been involved with,
sd	A.92 utt4	but my mom's family, each brother and sister takes a turn one year,
sd	A.92 utt5	and that's how they divide it up
b	B.93 utt1	Uh huh.
o@	A.94 utt1	and then, she has ten in that family
sd	B.95 utt1	But then one brother and sister from each family.
b	B.97 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.98 utt1	and each one of them take their turn.
ba	B.99 utt1	wow,
b	B.99 utt2	uh huh.
sd	A.100 utt1	And then the parent who's turn it is, her children help her,
b	B.101 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.102 utt2	like if it was my mother's turn all of us children would help her put it on kind of thing.
ba	B.103 utt1	I see, uh huh.
b	B.105 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.107 utt1	Uh huh.
ba	B.109 utt1	wow,
b	A.110 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.110 utt2	and, the thing is, that, the real part is there are two mailings that go out,
sd	A.110 utt3	and the first one is to just kind of give an approximate date and time so you can start making,
