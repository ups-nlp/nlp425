o	A.1 utt1	Greg,
sd	A.1 utt2	I'm not familiar.
qy	A.1 utt3	I think, you guys in Indiana, don't you have the death penalty?
ny	B.2 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.2 utt2	we do have the death penalty here.
sd	B.2 utt3	It's not exercised very often,
sd	B.2 utt4	but we do have it.
b	A.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.4 utt1	I believe it,
sd@	B.4 utt2	I can't even remember the last execution we had here actually. personally I'm in favor of capital punishment.
b	A.5 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.6 utt2	I know there's a lot of problems with it,
sv	B.6 utt3	but, seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that the person I feel, doesn't deserve to live, doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in prison for life.
b	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	A.9 utt1	Right.
sd	B.10 utt1	But, I know there's a lot of problems with that, like, well, they say, okay, if you put them on death row and execute them, well, then ten years later you find out that he really didn't do it, then that life was wasted,
sv	B.10 utt2	but just seems like in some cases that it's a good policy.
b	A.11 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	A.13 utt2	I tend to agree with you,
sd	A.13 utt3	I've changed my views even within the last few years, to be honest.
sd	A.13 utt4	when I was an undergraduate, I was a member of Amnesty International
b	B.14 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.15 utt1	and, of course, at that time, you know, I thought, it was stupid to kill anybody for,
sv	A.15 utt3	the eye for an eye was a stupid argument.
aa	B.16 utt1	Right.
sv	A.17 utt1	But the, the more,
sd	A.17 utt2	now I live in downtown Dallas,
sd	A.17 utt3	and I, you know, I've seen, I've seen cases in the news and all where, you know, a person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder.
b	B.18 utt1	Right.
b	B.20 utt1	Right.
sv	A.21 utt1	I think that maybe, a good solution to capital punishment might be, reserve it solely for, repeat offenders of a crime like, murder.
aa	B.22 utt1	that's a thought that I had never really had on that which seems pretty sensible.
b	A.23 utt1	Yeah,
o@	A.23 utt2	 Yeah,
sv^m	A.25 utt2	it seems sensible and failsafe.
sv	A.25 utt4	you know, not completely failsafe,
sv	A.25 utt5	but if a man's convicted of two murders, you know, there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong.
aa	B.26 utt1	Right.
sv	A.27 utt2	to tell you how liberal I have turned, toward this, or, or whatever side that is I've kind of chosen, I believe it that, big time drug importers, like, say Noriega for example that these people need to be, eliminated, from society,
b	B.28 utt1	Right.
b	B.28 utt2	Yeah.
b	B.30 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.32 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.33 utt2	and I think the death penalty is the best choice for those people, because, really any kind of, jail sentence for them is just another chance to, create another power structure .
aa	B.34 utt1	Yeah,
aa	B.34 utt2	you're right there.
sd	B.34 utt4	basically my views, I guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that you know, they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars, taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they're going to be there for life, they're never going to be rehabilitated.
b	A.35 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.37 utt1	Right.
b	A.39 utt1	Right.
sv	B.40 utt1	I mean, I don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with
b	A.41 utt1	Right.
sv	B.42 utt1	so to me I'm paying taxes, you know, twenty percent of my check or whatever to keep somebody alive who I, in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society,
b	A.43 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.44 utt2	so I'm all in favor of it.
b	A.45 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.45 utt2	Well, do you,
qy	A.45 utt3	are there cases where you think that, the capital punishment shouldn't be, sentenced?
h	B.46 utt1	Well, I really don't know on that question.
sv	B.46 utt2	It just seems like,
sv	B.46 utt3	for instance, the Jeffrey Dahlmer case. I mean, I don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society.
sv	B.46 utt4	I hope the guy never gets back out on the streets
b	A.47 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.48 utt1	and in that case, Wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty,
sd	B.48 utt2	so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment
b	A.49 utt1	Right.
sv	B.50 utt1	and I think that he should not be allowed to live,
sv	B.50 utt2	but, you know, then you're kind of playing God which is never a good thing to do.
aa	A.51 utt1	That's true,
aa	A.51 utt2	yeah.
aa	A.53 utt1	Right.
sd	B.54 utt1	But cases where I think the death penalty should be withheld, not really that I can think of.
sv(^q)	B.54 utt2	I would, I would be in favor of the death penalty in things like, you know, murders, and like you said, repeat murders or serial killers
b	A.55 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.57 utt1	Uh huh.
ar	B.58 utt1	I don't really agree with the, death penalty for people like Noriega and such as that.
sv	B.58 utt2	I think that they're operating on a more,
sv	B.58 utt3	I mean, I know that they're causing massive problems in society up here,
sv	B.58 utt4	but I don't really think that it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live, because they're feeding our consumer needs.
b	A.59 utt1	Right.
b	A.61 utt1	Sure,
b	A.61 utt2	yeah,
sd	A.61 utt3	I understand your point.
qy^d	A.61 utt5	of course, you know, with, with Dahlmer now, you realize that I think it's Ohio, gets to try him next
sd	A.61 utt6	and they do have the death penalty.
b	B.62 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.64 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.65 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.65 utt2	so, that was a curious case.
b	B.66 utt1	Yeah,
sd^m	B.66 utt2	that is very curious.
sv	A.67 utt1	something is sort of nightmarish to say the least.
aa	B.68 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.70 utt1	that's right.
sd	A.71 utt1	well, here in Texas we,
sd	A.71 utt2	I think even this last week they had another, they,
sd	A.71 utt3	you know, they use their capital punishment by lethal injection,
