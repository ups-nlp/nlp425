sv^t	A.1 utt1	So, well, this is an appropriate topic the day after Earth Day,
b	B.2 utt1	Right.
qw	A.3 utt1	well, what do you think is, the main pollutants in the air?
sd	B.4 utt1	I have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that I think they put off so much
sv	B.4 utt2	and they're not regulated enough.
b	A.5 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.5 utt2	well , that's me too.
sd	A.5 utt4	on channel thirteen, they had some programs the day before,
sd	A.5 utt5	and I'm not sure that about yesterday, we didn't really watch it too much yesterday,
sd	A.5 utt6	but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and, you know, how we're affecting the Earth and things by what we do, as the people
b	B.6 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.7 utt2	and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot,
b	B.8 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.9 utt1	and that actually, as our population increases and, you know, of course, our, our cars, you know, our number of cars increase per the population, that's the problem. But also like you said the industry pollution
sd	A.9 utt2	and, you know, they're regulation that's placed on them I mean, it's better than it used to be
sd	A.9 utt3	but it's incredible that you know, they don't, they're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air.
b	B.10 utt1	Right.
sd	A.11 utt2	I can't stand that
sd	A.11 utt3	and I know for a fact that they get away with a lot that,
sd	A.11 utt4	you know, they're supposed to be regulated because we have a plant, I don't know about T I but we have a Pillsbury plant, in a town adjacent to ours,
b	B.12 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.13 utt2	and I know people that work there that,
sd	A.13 utt3	of course, you wouldn't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals,
aa	B.14 utt1	No.
sd	A.15 utt1	but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of what they do, to, make their dough and to, clean out the flour and stuff like that,
bh	B.16 utt1	Really?
b	A.17 utt2	yeah,
sv	A.19 utt1	I mean, it's incredible.
sd	A.19 utt2	And, they said that you know, they have a little creek that runs by them
sd	A.19 utt3	and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they, you know, shut down everything
 sd	A.19 utt4	and they clean up their act, but on a normal basis that they're dumping things,
 b	B.20 utt1	Oh.
 +	A.21 utt1	that they're not supposed to be dumping,
 sd	A.21 utt2	and I'm like, if they're getting away with it, can you imagine,
b	B.22 utt1	Right.
sd	A.23 utt2	that's a Pillsbury plant
sd	A.23 utt3	I can't imagine plants,
sd	B.24 utt1	I wouldn't have thought that Pillsbury would, the, I mean, or even had chem , you know, well,
b	A.25 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.25 utt2	they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff, you know to break the flours down
b	B.26 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.27 utt2	and then they also do testing there,
sv	A.27 utt4	you know, when you consider, you know, it's probably not radioactive
sv	A.27 utt5	but toxic can be anything that's classified that can damage the Earth.
b	B.28 utt1	Right,
b	B.28 utt2	yeah.
sv	A.29 utt1	So, there could be a lot of things that they could put, you know, that chemical wise that they use to, that they are testing with, that they're dumping.
b	B.30 utt1	Right,
sd	B.30 utt2	you know, like in,
b	A.31 utt2	Yeah.
 +	B.32 utt1	In packaging
b	A.33 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.33 utt2	I don't think they do the packaging at this plant,
b	B.34 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.35 utt1	but they do a lot of research
sd	A.35 utt2	and they do, do a lot of the refining up there
b	B.36 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.37 utt2	what's it called when you do flour,
sd	B.38 utt1	only thing I can think is bleaching
sd	B.38 utt2	but, I mean, I, I don't know how they do the flour.
b	A.39 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.41 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.42 utt1	But, we're on the southwest side of Houston
sd	B.42 utt2	we don't have that much as far as, aiming in the plants over on this, the east side does.
b	A.43 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.44 utt1	We've got Imperial sugar
sd	B.44 utt2	and you know, they're right there on the creek also
 sd	B.44 utt3	and, they've been there for years.
b	A.45 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.47 utt2	I mean, you think about it, you know,
sv	A.47 utt3	it's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just,
h	A.47 utt4	I'm not really sure
sv	A.47 utt5	but I would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down or stream or such,
b	B.48 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.49 utt1	or you can, you know, do, testing on the ground itself at that point,
b	B.50 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.51 utt1	but when they pollute into the air you know, and you've got movement through the air, it's going to move a lot of that off.
sd	A.51 utt2	So, I don't see, you know, how they can do some of the te ,
sd	A.51 utt3	unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution, you know, like in Los Angeles or the bigger cities where it tends to get stuck there,
b	B.52 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.53 utt1	you know, that you have a lot more particles in the air,
b	B.54 utt1	Right,
b	B.54 utt2	yeah.
 +	A.55 utt1	you know, per, per particles in the surrounding community because it's not moved away,
 b	B.56 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.58 utt1	I know that,
sd	B.58 utt2	I worry every now and then,
sd	B.58 utt3	we're still on a well water,
sd	B.58 utt4	we're not on city water,
b	A.59 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.60 utt1	and I think, well, what if somebody's dumped something back there in the, and no one knows about it and, you know, it sinked in through the ground and all that,
b	A.61 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.61 utt2	well, I know out in some,
h	A.61 utt3	I'm not sure,
sd	A.61 utt4	I can't remember the name of the county
sd	A.61 utt5	it's where Stillwater is or, sweet,
b	B.62 utt1	Yeah.
ar	A.63 utt2	no
h	A.63 utt3	I'm not sure,
^h	A.63 utt4	I know it,
sd	A.63 utt6	I know we have a piece property there,
sd	A.63 utt7	it's called Dublin,
b	B.64 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.65 utt1	it's in Dublin, Texas.
sd	A.65 utt2	I'm not really sure what the county,
sd	A.65 utt3	it's Stephen,
ar	A.65 utt4	no
sd	A.65 utt5	Stephenville.
b	B.66 utt1	okay,
b	B.66 utt2	okay.
b	A.67 utt1	Okay,
sd	A.67 utt2	where Stephenville's at, they've had a lot of problems because they've, introduced a lot of dairies there,
b	B.68 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.70 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.71 utt1	so, they have a lot of cattle in the area,
sd	A.71 utt2	I mean, per, per lot,
sd	A.71 utt3	you know, they've got like a lot of head of cattle because dairies they don't th ,
sd	A.71 utt4	it's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free,
b	B.72 utt1	Right,
b	B.72 utt2	uh huh.
sd	A.73 utt1	they've got to have them there to be able to milk them.
sd	A.73 utt3	and I read in this article, I couldn't believe it, where, you know, like, one cow like, a day, produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure.
b	B.74 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.75 utt1	One cow,
sd	A.75 utt2	I was like, my God,
sd	A.75 utt4	and this thing says that, you know, people think, well, cow manure is good for fertilizer
sd	A.75 utt5	but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it's not
sd	A.75 utt6	when, you know, you buy cow manure at the store they've added stuff to it
sd	A.75 utt7	and they've added humus and stuff that, breaks it down,
b	B.76 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.77 utt2	and this, and this article said that they've got a real problem that, you've got toxins and, bacteria in the manure that is,
sd	A.77 utt3	what it's doing is it's going through,
sd	A.77 utt4	they don't have a very deep, o ,
sd	A.77 utt5	you know, they're water, they're natural water,
b	B.78 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.79 utt2	I forget what that's called with, you know,
sd	A.79 utt3	it's like a spring water,
b	B.80 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.81 utt1	but it's below the surface
sd	A.81 utt2	it's not very far down,
b	B.82 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.83 utt1	and all this stuff is seeping through to the water,
b	B.84 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.85 utt1	and like, they're afraid that, you know, within a certain amount of years, they're water in that town will be totally polluted,
ba	B.86 utt1	It will.
sd	A.87 utt1	and they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have, completely polluted, so that you know, there's too many toxins and bacterial growth,
b	B.88 utt1	Uh huh,
b	B.88 utt2	yeah,
sd	A.89 utt1	and I'm like my God, you know, you know, just from them introducing dairy farms, in that one county.
b	B.90 utt1	Right.
b	B.92 utt1	Right.
b	B.94 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.94 utt2	and the ground will filter some of it but not all of it.
aa	A.95 utt1	No,
sd	A.95 utt2	not when you figure,
sd	A.95 utt3	I didn't realize one cow produces that much manure
sd	A.95 utt4	and they were talking like, thousands of cows, you know, they were talking thousands cows in one little tiny area.
sd	B.96 utt1	These are well fed .
ba	B.100 utt1	Good grief, these are well fed cows, ,
aa	A.101 utt1	Well, they are evidently.
sd	A.101 utt2	But, I mean, evidently a normal cow produces that much too,
 b	B.102 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.103 utt1	but they're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it's not, you know, a problem,
b	B.104 utt1	Right.
sd	A.105 utt1	but when they get them in these tiny little areas, you know, they've got a real big problem,
sd	A.105 utt2	and they said that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff, and taking it to, these like ponds that they had to filter it with,
b	B.106 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.107 utt2	but the ponds because they've had so much rain in the past few years, they just, overflow
b	B.108 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.109 utt2	and they overflow into the creeks and stuff in the area.
sd	A.109 utt3	So, that just creates,
sv	A.109 utt5	and, it was just disgusting
sd	A.109 utt6	it said the creeks will foam.
b	B.110 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.111 utt1	people stand outside their houses and watch the creeks foam brown and all,
ba	B.112 utt1	now that's bad.
sd	A.113 utt1	and I'm just like, my gosh,
sd	A.113 utt2	and the smell is really bad they sa ,
sd	B.114 utt1	, I was going to say, the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of cow manure was going to be bad.
b	A.115 utt1	Yeah,
h	A.115 utt2	but I don't know
sd	A.115 utt3	it really frightens me though as far as you know, thinking of just air pollution itself
sd	A.115 utt4	and, channel thirteen they're really, emphasizing the problem with acid rain, you know,
b	B.116 utt1	Uh huh.
 sv	A.117 utt1	if we keep putting that stuff into the air and, you know, if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it it's really going to be a problem for, the Earth, you know, what the Earth is receiving back, you know, because how can you tell where it's going to come down at.
b	B.118 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.120 utt1	Right,
b^r	B.120 utt2	right.
sd	B.120 utt3	And then cutting the trees, you know, that bothers me.
b	A.121 utt1	Yeah.
^2	A.123 utt1	The rain forest and all.
aa	B.124 utt1	yes,
sd	B.124 utt2	we've been wanting to,
h	B.124 utt3	well, not me
sd	B.124 utt4	but, it's been or suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here,
sd	B.124 utt5	I'm like, no,
sd	B.124 utt6	you know, for what's cut down here, you know, more will be cut down someplace else
sd	B.124 utt7	and it will just take that longer to grow back,
b	A.125 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.126 utt1	and trees help so that,
h	B.126 utt2	, I don't,
sd	A.127 utt1	Well, they do because, what is it, carbon dioxide, they use that where we can't synthesize it
b	B.128 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.129 utt2	and they're synthesizing it for us.
b	B.130 utt1	Right,
b^r	B.130 utt2	right,
sv	B.130 utt3	believe me it's just so much better.
b	A.131 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.132 utt1	So, yeah,
sv	B.132 utt3	I think there's lots that could be done to improve how things are done now.
b	A.133 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.133 utt2	I think we just have to,
h	A.133 utt3	I don't know personally, you know,
sv	A.133 utt4	I suppose, you know, if you just make sure your car is, is working properly
b	B.134 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.135 utt4	nowadays they have the emission controls on them
sd	A.135 utt5	but, I think the main thing is just keep on your legislators back, you know, as far as,
sv	A.135 utt6	seems like they've only just really started as far as the environment saying, okay, we're really going to get involved
b	B.136 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.137 utt2	it's really becoming a problem.
sd	A.137 utt3	By the year two thousand there will,
sd	A.137 utt4	what are we going to have,
sd	A.137 utt5	what kind of results are we going to have for the environment.
b	B.138 utt1	Right.
