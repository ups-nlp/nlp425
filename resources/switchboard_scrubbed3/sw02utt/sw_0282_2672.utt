ad	A.1 utt1	Start.
qw	B.2 utt1	What kind of recycling programs do you have in Rowlett?
sd	A.3 utt2	well right now they've got a, kind of a central location off of the main highway,
sd	A.3 utt3	and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper, plastic, I think three bins for glass, white, green, and whatever other combination there is.
sd	A.5 utt1	and I think they've got some kind of container for aluminum.
 sd	B.6 utt1	Plano's doing real good on that.
sd	B.6 utt2	they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans. Which we're supposed to put all our week's garbage into it,
b	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.8 utt2	and of course it doesn't fit right now.
b	A.9 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.10 utt1	But now we start in May, breaking it down,
sd	B.10 utt2	and they're picking it all up.
sd	B.12 utt1	So they're going to by,
sd	B.12 utt2	and we have to separate our papers, and our glass,
sd	B.12 utt3	and then, they have one day for, like, everything you picked up from your yard,
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.14 utt1	and we put that in disposable bags,
sd	B.14 utt2	and they pick that up on Monday.
sd	B.16 utt1	So it's really great.
sd	B.16 utt2	I'm you know, completely for it,
sd	B.16 utt3	I think it's marvelous.
ba	A.17 utt1	Well, that's good.
sd	A.17 utt2	Well, Rowlett had sent out a survey, not too long ago, in terms in how many people were interested in having a pick up, I guess, on the days they do trash or something like that.
sd	A.17 utt3	And apparently a lot of people responded to it favorably, because they're going to do it.
sd	A.17 utt4	I don't know how soon they're going to do it, or how organized it's going to be,
sd	A.17 utt5	but they're supposed to initiate that sometime in the next couple of months.
qy	B.18 utt1	Well, does your,
qy	B.18 utt2	where you work, do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that?
no	A.19 utt1	I've never noticed that.
sd	A.19 utt2	We don't have a whole lot, because we're in a hospital setting,
sd	A.19 utt3	so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria.
qy	B.20 utt1	Well, down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your, you know, pop cans, and things like that?
nn	A.21 utt1	no.
sd^e	A.21 utt2	there's only one pop machine
sd	A.21 utt3	and it's not accessible to the cafeteria now,
sd	A.21 utt4	so, mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea.
bf	B.22 utt1	So you don't have much choice there.
aa	A.23 utt1	No .
sd	A.23 utt2	not really.
sd	B.24 utt1	Well I work at, J C Penny
sd	B.24 utt2	and last week they brought,
sd	B.24 utt3	they have a sign up that says for one full week you bring in your old wire hangers
b	A.25 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.26 utt2	and they're going to recycle them.
sd	B.28 utt1	So it's getting people clean out their closets and such.
b	A.29 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.30 utt1	And then like, the week before that, they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good, bring it in
sd	B.30 utt2	and they brought it down to the shelters.
sd	B.30 utt3	And, they have, one, two, they have three, I think, that I know of for cans for people have pop,
b	A.31 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.32 utt2	and they put them right near where they have the time cards.
b	A.33 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.34 utt1	And it works great.
sd	B.34 utt2	And they have one in the room where the snack machines are too.
ba	A.35 utt1	That's good.
sd	B.36 utt1	So they're really going at it,
sd	B.36 utt2	and I think it's marvelous because,
b	A.37 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.37 utt2	I guess Rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is.
sd	A.39 utt1	And I think they're trying to make some changes.
sd	A.39 utt2	I noticed at the library or someplace this past, month, month and a half ago, they were having a speaker, talk about doing lawn work and, how important it is to cut your lawn without a bag. Just to kind of mulch it, rather than bag it up, because of all the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff,
 b	B.40 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.41 utt2	and it's, I guess a lot more ecological to just mow the grass and let it work it's way back into the soil.
qy	B.42 utt1	Well, did you watch the program the other night on, was it SAVE AMERICA?
 na	A.43 utt1	I saw part of that.
sv	B.44 utt1	It was good.
sd	B.44 utt2	The only thing I thought, that I haven't been trying, is when I, you know, go to take a shower, to save the water, and to put it on my plants. Which I had never thought about before.
b	A.45 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.47 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.48 utt1	But I've already gone to,
sd	B.48 utt2	I started years ago, I guess, not years ago,
sd	B.48 utt4	I would say five years ago, turning off I mean my water faucet, in the sink when I brush my teeth.
b	A.49 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.50 utt2	But I didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water.
b	A.51 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.52 utt1	That was surprising to me.
sd	B.54 utt1	I missed that question, totally, I mean really bad.
sd	B.54 utt2	I'm trying to think,
sd	B.54 utt3	I didn't miss too many,
sd	B.54 utt4	I can't remember what my score was,
sd	B.54 utt5	but I did exceeding well.
sd	B.54 utt6	I was surprised.
sd	B.54 utt7	But I didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed.
sd	B.54 utt8	That was a shocker to me.
b	A.55 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.55 utt2	well there are a lot of things that aren't,
sd	A.55 utt4	that's, one of the things I wonder about,
sd^t	A.55 utt5	one of the questions was, do you think more should be done, or something else.
sd	A.55 utt6	I wonder about some of the products that they don't take, like some of the plastics and things that they don't take. why they couldn't do more recycling with those.
sd	B.56 utt1	Well, I was in, Bizmart the other day,
sd	B.56 utt2	and, what I don't understand is there is recycled paper in there,
sd	B.56 utt3	and it cost more than regular paper.
sd	B.58 utt1	And it was only, I think, forty cents more, you know, fifty cents more,
sd	B.58 utt2	but, It upset me to realize that they're going through the expense of recycling,
b	A.59 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.60 utt2	but people aren't buying it,
sd	B.60 utt3	so the cost of it is higher.
ba	A.61 utt1	True.
b	A.61 utt2	Yeah,
sd	A.61 utt3	I noticed that about things like
sd	A.61 utt4	I seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and lawn additives and that type of thing,
sd	A.61 utt5	but the cost is like, double or sometimes triple, the regular fertilizers and things you buy.
b	B.62 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.63 utt4	you know, and, for the environment it's, there's a good reason to do it,
sv	A.63 utt5	but the cost is kind of prohibitive.
sd	B.64 utt1	Now, see that's recycling, you know,
sd	B.64 utt2	companies that do at least go into it,
sd	B.64 utt3	I'd like to see subsidy by the government or something, or tax wise or something, heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular.
b	A.65 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.66 utt1	So that people would use this stuff over again.
b	A.67 utt1	Yeah,
ba	A.67 utt2	it's a good idea.
sd	B.68 utt1	It's like when he was saying, which one was recyclable, which was reusable,
b	A.69 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.70 utt1	and the recycle ones are better to use,
sd	B.70 utt2	but lots of times you don't even see the signs on the bottles.
b	A.71 utt1	Yeah,
ba	A.71 utt2	true.
sv	B.72 utt1	And if we're going to really do something, they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it.
sd	B.72 utt2	I had to put my bifocals on to see it .
sv	B.74 utt1	That's hard when you're in a grocery store and you're short anyway.
b	A.75 utt1	Yeah.
 sv	B.76 utt1	You have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf.
sv(^q)	B.76 utt2	You haven't got enough nerve to say well, put it back,
^q	B.76 utt3	it's not recyclable.
sd	A.77 utt1	I'd heard something stranger,
sd	A.77 utt2	talk about bottles the other day on the radio station, I think it's K L T Y. They were talking about the,
sd	A.77 utt3	I think it's in Canada they're using, recyclable milk jugs, plastic milk jugs, as a reinforcement for roads. For road repairs.
b	B.78 utt1	Uh huh.
bh	B.80 utt1	really?
sd	A.81 utt2	And apparently they don't break down very easily,
sd	A.81 utt3	and, they don't expand or contract when the weather changes,
b	B.82 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.83 utt2	and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing.
sd	B.84 utt2	along that same line, they said they were using,
^h	B.84 utt3	what is, oh, I know,
sd	B.84 utt4	it was toilets. You know, the old ones? Smashing them up, because that stuff there is great in road work.
b	A.85 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.87 utt1	Huh.
sd	B.88 utt1	And I thought, well, that's good.
sd	B.88 utt2	And then I saw recycling on tires between,
sd	B.88 utt3	well, hoses were being used, and, soaker hoses, made out of old tires.
b	A.89 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.91 utt1	Yeah.
^h	B.92 utt2	something else was made out of old tires,
^h	B.92 utt3	I was trying to remember what it was. I can't think of it now.
sd	B.92 utt4	But I was trying to get my, kids, you know, to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes.
b	A.93 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.94 utt1	And just anything, to, you know, recycle rather than keep throwing it away,
sd	B.94 utt2	but my biggest problem is, I take the bags out of the store, buy the bags to bring the back,
sd	B.94 utt3	and then I forget to bring them in the store.
b	A.95 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.96 utt1	I'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out.
sd	B.96 utt2	I wish they'd really push this recycling bit, because I really didn't realize how much stuff I actually throw away.
sv	A.97 utt1	Well, I think the more people are aware of it, the more they'll do.
sv	A.97 utt2	I think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is, and how important it is to do that.
sd	B.98 utt1	You know what I'd like to see a little more.
sd	B.98 utt2	I don't have any little tiny kids,
b	A.99 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.100 utt1	but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now, in five years, when they get bigger, it'll work a little bit more, too.
b	A.101 utt1	Yeah.
ba	A.103 utt1	True.
sv	B.104 utt2	we've all got to do it right now.
sd	B.104 utt4	I really amazed to find out that, eighty per cent are filled now, in garbage fills.
sd	B.104 utt5	In five years we're supposed to be at max.
b	A.105 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.106 utt1	I don't think I can keep my own garbage.
sd	B.106 utt2	I mean, I might not have that much,
sd	B.106 utt3	but I wouldn't,
