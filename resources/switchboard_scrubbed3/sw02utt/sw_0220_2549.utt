sv	B.1 utt1	I guess we're on.
ad	A.2 utt1	Well, hang on
co	A.2 utt2	let me try it again because usually ,
qy^t	B.3 utt1	Do you usually get a message?
ny	A.4 utt1	Yeah.
co^t	B.7 utt1	Hang on let me check on it .
h	B.7 utt2	I don't know.
co^t	A.8 utt1	Well, let me try it once more .
sv^t	A.8 utt2	Well, I think we're on, maybe.
b	B.9 utt1	Okay.
sd^t	A.10 utt1	I guess we'll find out .
b	B.11 utt1	Yeah.
qy	A.12 utt1	So, in Maryland are you a Skins fan?
ng	B.13 utt1	well, not really from, you know,
sd	B.13 utt2	I really wasn't from here
sd	B.13 utt3	so, the teams I really root for in football are the Niners and the Seahawks, you know, mostly because, only the Niners because I used to live out in California, you know, like, I like Seattle because I like Seattle
b	A.14 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.15 utt2	and besides I like the city.
bk	A.16 utt1	okay.
bf	A.16 utt2	So, you were out there in San Francisco?
ny	B.17 utt1	yeah.
sd^e	B.17 utt2	San Jose, actually but but close,
bh	A.18 utt1	yeah?
b	B.21 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.22 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.22 utt2	it's, other than the big catch, with the Forty niners and the Cowboys back a few year ago I like San Francisco.
b	B.23 utt1	okay.
h	A.24 utt1	But, I don't know
sd	A.24 utt2	I never really was a Cowboys fan until I moved down to Texas.
qy	B.25 utt1	is that where you are now?
ny	A.26 utt1	Yeah.
bk	B.27 utt1	okay.
sd	A.28 utt1	I'm in Dallas
qy^d	A.28 utt2	and, I guess when you're down here in Dallas you finally get indoctrinated into the Cowboys because, you know this is a big football territory down here.
b	B.29 utt1	Uh huh.
ny	B.31 utt1	yeah.
sv	A.32 utt1	And, unfortunately, of course, the Cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years.
b	B.33 utt1	Uh huh.
h	A.34 utt2	I don't know,
sv	A.34 utt4	they're still behind them
sv	A.34 utt5	but, it's not like it used to be.
b	B.35 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.35 utt2	Well, you know, you back the winners
sv	B.35 utt3	and you don't back them when they're not doing well .
ba	A.36 utt1	That's right .
sd	A.36 utt2	But I think, actually, in trying to follow, you know the Cowboys over the years I think, they used to have a philosophy for, well I don't know, probably the last twenty five years except for about the last about five or six years they always went out and tried to draft the best, athletes. And didn't really put them draft for any particular spot.
b	B.37 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.39 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.40 utt2	But they would go out and try to go for, the best people and then mold them into different areas or find their natural niche.
b	B.41 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.42 utt1	And then about four or five years ago, they started going after, specific players or positions, you know,
sd	A.42 utt2	like the press would get down on Landry,
sd	A.42 utt3	and this is when Schramm was still there.
b	B.43 utt1	Uh huh.
sd(^q)	A.44 utt1	And, they'd go after them saying, jeez what you really need is a defensive end.
sd	A.44 utt2	So they'd go out and try to find a defensive end
sd	A.44 utt3	and when they drafted somebody and he didn't workout at that spot it really wasn't a good enough athlete to move to any place else.
b	B.45 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.46 utt1	so I think it was kind ever interesting.
sv	A.46 utt2	I think the decline of the Cowboys as a powerhouse really kind of started with, not drafting the best athletes.
b	B.47 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.47 utt2	It makes sense because, you know, you've got the flexibility if they're good athlete they can, you know, do a bunch of different things.
b	A.48 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.48 utt2	yeah.
sd	B.51 utt2	my, my, my main sport is baseball
sd	B.51 utt3	but, you know, I've been enjoying football
sd	B.51 utt4	but I don't know it as well.
b	A.52 utt1	Yeah.
qy^g	B.53 utt2	Cowboys are going to have a problem aren't they?
qy	B.53 utt3	is it this year they don't have a draft pick because of the Walker trade
qw	B.53 utt4	or what was the whole deal on that?
sd	A.54 utt1	they still have some, some draft picks, that they got,
qy^g	B.55 utt1	They don't, have anything high do they?
nn	A.58 utt1	No.
sd	A.58 utt2	Actually, they picked up some from Minnesota.
sd	A.58 utt3	I think it was, Minnesota's ,
ba	B.59 utt1	that's right,
sd	B.59 utt2	that's right.
sd	B.59 utt4	it went the other way.
b	A.60 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.61 utt1	What was I thinking.
sd	B.61 utt2	they, they traded Herschel, to Minnesota.
sd	A.62 utt1	They traded Walker,
aa	A.62 utt2	yeah .
b	B.63 utt2	Yeah,
b	B.63 utt3	okay.
sd	B.63 utt4	My brain is really working well tonight.
bd	A.64 utt1	That's okay,
sd	A.64 utt3	I've got a friend that, lives right next to the Cowboys' training camp.
b	B.65 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.66 utt1	And, he sees them out running a lot
sd	A.66 utt2	and every once in a while gets a chance to talk to some of the guys
sd	A.66 utt3	and they're all thinking that, man, they, they really got something going this year,
b	B.67 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.68 utt1	but I guess, when you have a whole bunch of, professional athletes that get together at the beginning of the year everybody's got great hopes.
sv	A.68 utt2	{D You, know, } I guess it's the same way with baseball or anybody, you know,
b	B.69 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.70 utt2	Spring training until you actually start going out and getting out against the competition everything probably looks pretty good.
b	B.71 utt1	yeah.
sv	B.71 utt2	I mean, you know, if you go to,
sv	B.71 utt3	I, you know, I'm sure if you go to any of the twenty eight coaches in football in training camp they say, we're going to be Super Bowl Champs
sv	B.71 utt4	because, I know in baseball, you know, any manager you go to say, well, we're going to be in the World Series, even though, you know, there's not a prayer .
b	A.72 utt1	Yeah,
b	A.72 utt2	really .
b	A.76 utt1	Yeah,
b	A.78 utt1	yeah,
b	A.78 utt2	really.
sv	B.79 utt1	this is the way it is.
qy	B.79 utt2	Well, Kim , I mean, didn't the Cowboys even finish,
qy^g	B.79 utt3	they finished pretty close to five hundred last year didn't they?
ny	A.80 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.80 utt2	they did. As a matter of fact,
qy^g	B.81 utt1	Because they only won one game the year before, right?
ny	A.82 utt1	Yeah.
bk	B.83 utt1	Okay.
b	B.83 utt2	Yeah,
sd	B.83 utt3	I enjoyed that because it was against the Skins.
qy^d	A.84 utt1	Well, you don't like the Skins?
nn	B.85 utt1	no.
sd^e	B.85 utt2	I, I live near Baltimore
sd	B.85 utt3	and, I really don't like D C a whole lot at all .
bk	A.86 utt1	okay.
sv	B.87 utt2	they, they got a big thing because of you know, the, the expansion going on in baseball.
sd	B.87 utt3	D C is like talking about how they're going to get a baseball team and everything.
sd	B.87 utt4	It's like you guys aren't going to get a baseball team, I'm sorry it's not going to happen.
ba	A.88 utt1	Jeez.
sv	B.89 utt1	But, of course, you know, the, the one, the griping is that you know, if, if Washington doesn't get a baseball team then Baltimore shouldn't get a football team. Which is probably true,
sd	B.89 utt2	but anyway, I've never liked D C a whole lot
sd	B.89 utt3	and a really hate the Redskins. And a lot of it's because, you know, I got a lot of people, you know, at work with and everything that are big Redskin fans.
ba	A.90 utt1	Well, of course,
b	A.92 utt1	Yeah.
ba	A.92 utt2	yeah.
b	A.92 utt3	Yeah,
sd	A.92 utt4	of course, then you're not that far from Philadelphia.
b	B.93 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.93 utt2	I've never liked Philadelphia, the city a whole lot.
sd	B.93 utt3	The only reason I really enjoy the Eagles at all is because, I really like Randall Cunningham.
b	A.94 utt1	okay.
sd	A.94 utt3	it was Buddy Ryan, the one that I can't, stand too much.
sd	B.95 utt2	well, considering how well he gets along with, Jimmy Johnson that doesn't surprise me.
b	A.96 utt1	Yeah,
b	A.96 utt2	really.
b	B.97 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.97 utt3	the Baltimore Sun has this, cartoonist in the sports section
sd	B.97 utt6	I guess it was January, when, Jimmy Johnson got named coach of the year or whatever.
b	A.98 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.99 utt1	It was the same year that Buddy Ryan got fired.
sd	B.99 utt2	And, he had this cartoon in there about Jimmy Johnson's big day, you know,
sd	B.99 utt3	the first thing is the phone call you know, from the league saying he you know, was coach of the year
sd	B.99 utt4	and the second was this phone call from Buddy Ryan, I got fired can you believe that .
ba	A.100 utt1	jeez.
b	A.100 utt2	Yeah,
qy^d	A.100 utt3	actually, you said you lived near, Baltimore?
ny	B.101 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.102 utt2	I used to travel out that way a lot
sd	A.102 utt3	and, actually I used to drive a lot between Baltimore and Washington
ar	B.103 utt1	No.
sd	B.103 utt2	I lived,
qy	B.103 utt3	do you know what Ellicott City is?
nn	A.104 utt1	no.
sd@	B.105 utt1	it's just west of Baltimore, off Route Seventy. Yeah,
b	A.106 utt1	okay.
sd	B.107 utt2	but basical , well, Route Seventy and Route Forty.
b	A.108 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.110 utt1	I used to go out of B W I a lot.
b	B.111 utt2	Yeah,
sd	B.111 utt3	that's not far from where the new football stadium would be if we got an N F L team .
qy^d	A.112 utt1	yeah?
b	B.113 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.113 utt2	Well, they've built a new stadium downtown,
sd	B.113 utt3	it's opening next year.
sd	A.114 utt2	I forgot the name of it.
qy	A.114 utt3	Is it the, the Wharf or the, Inner Harbor.
na	B.115 utt1	The Inner Harbor.
ny	B.117 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.117 utt2	It's, a couple of blocks west.
sd	B.117 utt3	there is an old railroad yard, basically,
b	A.118 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.119 utt2	there's a big long railroad shed
sd	B.119 utt3	and then there's, an old station
sd	B.119 utt4	and they're building the stadium on the other side of the shed from the Inner Harbor, which is really stupid because one of the big selling points of the new stadium is supposed to be this view of the Inner Harbor
sd	B.119 utt5	and the only way you're going to have a view of is this big brick wall ,
b	A.120 utt1	Great.
sd	B.121 utt1	but, you know, they're building the baseball stadium
sd	B.121 utt2	and they've got land set aside for a football stadium if they ever get a N F L team.
aa	A.122 utt1	 Yeah.
sd	B.123 utt1	So it's, real easy access from south of Baltimore like the airport or more importantly for the Orioles from Washington D C.
sd	B.125 utt1	The Orioles say they get twenty five percent of I mean, their attendance from D C.
sd	A.126 utt4	the Colts you know, still to me are the Baltimore Colts.
b	B.127 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.128 utt1	You know?
ny	B.129 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.129 utt2	They really ought to change the name I think in Indianapolis.
sd	B.129 utt3	I, never been real thrilled with, well, not, you know,
sd	B.129 utt4	sitting here and talking about all the cities that I hate,
sd	B.129 utt5	I went to Purdue University for a couple of years and, really learned to hate Indianapolis while I was out there .
b	A.130 utt1	okay.
sd	B.133 utt1	And, I was not real happy when they, left to go there of all places .
ba	@A.134 utt1	Jeez.
b	@A.134 utt2	Yeah,
qy	@A.134 utt3	so, you know, did you graduate from Purdue?
nn	B.135 utt1	No,
sd^e	B.135 utt2	I, I transferred to Delaware and graduated there.
qy^d	A.136 utt1	Delaware?
ny	B.137 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.138 utt1	there's not a whole lot in Delaware.
b	B.139 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.139 utt2	but it's close to Philadelphia and Baltimore,
b	A.140 utt1	Yeah,
ba	A.142 utt1	that's true.
qy^d@	A.142 utt2	I take it you're an east coast type guy?
na	B.143 utt1	kind of all over the place but, eas , east coast lately,
 +@	A.144 utt1	Plus the west, coast, right? .
