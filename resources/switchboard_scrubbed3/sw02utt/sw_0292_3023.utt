sd	A.1 utt2	well, I used to have the opinion wa , that there really was not any more crime in America, in the cities, anyway, than there was in previous centuries, before,
sv	A.1 utt4	The reason there seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced, reporting methods, with computers and other devices.
bf	B.2 utt1	Compile more statistics.
aa	A.3 utt1	That's right,
sv	A.3 utt2	and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets.
b	B.4 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.5 utt1	However, I have been persuaded, lately, I guess, simply by the, overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime.
aa	B.6 utt1	More especially where you are.
qr	B.6 utt2	Are you, in Washington D C or Washington state?
b	A.7 utt1	Well, yeah.
nn	A.9 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.9 utt2	I am in Washington D C.
b	B.10 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.10 utt2	yeah,
sd	A.11 utt2	you know, I do a lot of business here,
sd	A.11 utt3	and I come here quite often
sd	A.11 utt4	and that again is a sort of media perception there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in Washington. Regardless of the racial makeup,
b	B.12 utt1	yeah.
sd	A.13 utt3	there's pockets of violence that is so violent that they,
ba	B.14 utt1	It just really grabs your attention.
aa	A.15 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.16 utt1	It just makes the whole place seem like that.
b	A.17 utt1	Right.
sd	A.17 utt2	Now just to focus on that a minute, I guess,
sd	A.17 utt3	when, previous secretary of, educa , Bennett, I think his name was, became the drug czar, for, President Bush, he was going to focus on this area and do something about it
b	B.18 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.19 utt2	and I see that even he was met with, with little success, even though I guess a quite a bit of money and other, planning efforts went into that.
qo	B.20 utt1	what do you think is causing all this,
sv	B.22 utt3	crime, though I think it is increasing in number, it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity, and violence too.
aa	A.23 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.25 utt1	Well, I have three theories about it, you know, three things.
sd	A.25 utt2	I have one theory,
sd	A.25 utt3	and it's brought to us by two things.
sv	A.25 utt4	One I believe that this is a function of, the violence that young people see on television and the movies.
b	B.26 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.27 utt1	And, I am not just talking about, you know, role models of tough guys and gangsters and things like that,
sv	A.27 utt2	I am not even convinced that maybe things like football, hockey th , the, you know, the, and even baseball games now where everything is settled with a fight. You know, the immediate need to show some sort of violence to settle th , the argument.
sd	A.29 utt2	and then I am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree,
sd	A.29 utt4	I was reading the other day about, Corpus Christi, Texas which has the highest,
sd	A.29 utt5	I think it's Corpus Christi, that had the highest rates per hand gun death in America per capita.
b	B.32 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.32 utt2	I have not seen that,
sd	A.33 utt1	I mean the Saturday night special stuff
b	B.34 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.35 utt1	that's what I think about it,
sd	A.35 utt2	that's some of the things I think about it,
sd	A.35 utt3	plus I do not know,
qo	A.35 utt4	what are your views?
b	B.36 utt1	Well, yeah,
aa	B.36 utt2	I tend to agree with you with, you know,
sv	B.36 utt3	it seems anymore, a movie can not be considered good unless there's just some sort of violence, or something in it.
aa	A.37 utt1	Yes.
sv	B.38 utt3	and then you start making a movie and there's no call for something violent,
sv	B.38 utt4	so they just throw something in there just to say they have it .
aa	A.39 utt1	Exac ,
aa	A.39 utt2	well that's, that's the impression I get, you know.
b	B.40 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.41 utt1	and I imagine that you know, it just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society,
sv	A.41 utt3	it conditions people to it
sv	A.41 utt5	it has to be even, magnified to attract people's attention. I guess, to have them spend money on something like that.
aa	B.42 utt1	Yeah,
bf	B.42 utt2	you become callous.
b	B.44 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.45 utt1	And I am sure that it does form role models for young men and young women
b	B.46 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.47 utt1	I mean I, read now where we are, you know,
sd	A.47 utt2	young women are arrested fighting with knives over whatever. whatever reason, which is kind of unheard of when I was young.
nd	A.49 utt2	Now, I do not want to sound like an old fart,
sv	A.51 utt2	seems that those things did not happen in that manner before television.
sv	A.53 utt1	And I, I, I have to think that it has some influence on it.
sd	B.54 utt1	I listened to a radio talk show today at lunch time Rush Lynn Bottom / * sp: Limbaugh
b	A.55 utt1	Yeah.
qy^d	B.56 utt2	I do not know if you listen to him or not,
nn	A.57 utt1	No.
sd	B.58 utt1	he's on A M,
sd	B.58 utt2	but, there's a fellow that had called in and was lamenting about the,
sd	B.58 utt3	there was an interview done on the assistant chief of police for Los Angeles, the guy under Gates,
ny	A.59 utt1	yes.
sd	B.60 utt1	and they were just really coming down on him because of just some of the things that he believed in, some of his morals.
sd	B.60 utt2	For instance, they asked him if he spanked his kids,
sd(^q)	B.60 utt3	and he said "You bet, I believe in discipline".
sd	B.60 utt4	And people, I, I, I guess they confused discipline with punishment.
b	A.61 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.63 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.64 utt2	it seems anymore that, if you have, you know, this type of a moral stance, that people come down on you.
sv	B.64 utt3	It's like, you know, hey, everybody has to be free to do their own thing.
ar	B.64 utt4	And I disagree,
sv	B.64 utt5	and I think that's really contributing to this high rate of crime.
aa	A.65 utt1	Yes,
aa^r	A.65 utt2	yes.
sv	A.65 utt3	Well, I mean, I guess what I wanted to say and I stopped, I do not know, I got diverted, was that, there's so much of a return to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure.
sv	A.65 utt4	and that is not emphasized.
sd	A.65 utt5	I recognize there's over crowding problems
sv	A.65 utt6	and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now, that's complicated the entire process.
b	B.66 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.67 utt2	I guess it's the reflection of the society where we have so much more mobility and less attachment to,
sv	A.67 utt3	you know, it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community where you live
sd	A.67 utt4	or. I do not mean attachment and responsibility,
sv	B.68 utt1	Well, nobody feels responsibility to do something.
sv	B.68 utt2	It's like, boy, I wish they would stop doing that.
aa	A.69 utt1	Yes,
aa	A.69 utt2	that's right.
b	B.70 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.71 utt1	Yeah
h	A.71 utt2	I do not know how that's,
h	A.71 utt3	I do not think it's done by,
sv	A.71 utt4	the changes come simply by statutory nature.
sd	A.71 utt5	I do not know what it really will take .
sd	A.73 utt1	And, I do not know if I have solutions, except to,
sd	A.73 utt2	you know, I am sort of a, an advocate of, of letting people, of having free speech
sv	A.73 utt4	the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that.
b	B.74 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.75 utt3	it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort.
b	B.76 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.77 utt1	And the sacrifice is not that great.
qh	B.78 utt1	How many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between, you know, what you see and how yo ,
b	A.79 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.80 utt2	I mean, what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do.
aa	A.81 utt1	Yes,
aa	A.81 utt2	yes,
aa	A.81 utt3	I think that's correct.
sd	A.83 utt1	Well, Texas has, has always struck me,
sd	A.83 utt2	I mean I, I have lived in and out of Texas, both in the service and, short business stints.
sv	A.83 utt3	And it seems to me they are a pretty tough law and order state,
sv	A.83 utt5	but yet that does not seem to have effected the amount of violent right in the state.
b	B.84 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.84 utt3	well a lot of it can be contributed to the racial differences, I mean, just that we are so close, to the border with Mexico,
b	A.85 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.86 utt2	we have got a lot of that influence.
b	A.87 utt1	Yeah.
