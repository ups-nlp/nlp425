qo	A.1 utt1	So what do you think about it?
qo	A.1 utt2	How are we doing in recycling?
sv	B.2 utt1	Well, I think we need to do more.
sd	B.2 utt2	I mean, I know I need to do more.
sd	B.2 utt3	They have programs around where you can reach the,
sd	B.2 utt4	they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up.
b	A.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.4 utt1	But I have a hard time of you know, having a place, separating my trash,
sd	B.4 utt2	and get all the cans from the paper,
b	A.5 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.6 utt2	and, you know, I just haven't gotten that dedicated yet .
sd	A.7 utt1	I do a lot of work with the boy scouts,
sd	A.7 utt2	and we try to do a lot
b	B.8 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.9 utt1	but there's still a lot more we can do.
b	B.10 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.11 utt1	You know, I don't recycle my newspapers myself,
sd	A.11 utt2	but I noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have like a, a clothes hamper kind of thing that, you know, you lay your string in, then you put your papers in there tie them all up and bundle them up,
b	B.12 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.13 utt2	so I figured I might get me one of those because we don't always read the newspaper.
b	B.14 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.15 utt2	Sometimes it just sits around for a while,
sd	A.15 utt3	and then we just chuck it.
b	B.16 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.16 utt2	well, I don't get the paper every day,
sd	B.16 utt3	but, you know, I get it on,
sd	B.16 utt4	I try to buy, you know, the early edition for the coupons, you know, the Sunday edition.
b	A.17 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.18 utt1	But, then I just, you know, bundle it up and put it on you know, the front walk ev , you know, every Monday or every other Monday, and have them pick that up,
b	A.19 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.20 utt2	but that's the extent of what I've done.
sd	B.20 utt3	I'd like to be able to do more.
sd	B.20 utt4	The problem is, with a lot of it is, you know, it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it, you know
b	A.21 utt1	Yeah
sd	B.22 utt1	it's not always convenient to do it.
b	A.23 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.23 utt2	see, and here in Lubbock everything's so close.
sd	A.23 utt3	I can imagine what it's like up there.
b	B.24 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.24 utt2	I'm not exactly sure where you know, the can thing is,
sd	B.24 utt3	but, you know, sometimes it's just so,
sd	B.24 utt4	seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash, and have them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them.
b	A.25 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.27 utt1	See, I went out to Payless Cashways here a couple of days ago, as a matter of fact, and got me one of those little can crushers that I could put on the wall
b	B.28 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.29 utt1	and then I put me a little five gallon bucket,
sd	A.29 utt2	and it's just outside the garage door
b	B.30 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.31 utt1	so every time we drink a Coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket.
qy	B.32 utt1	Do those can crushers work good?
ny	A.33 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.33 utt2	I got one from Payless Cashways,
sd	A.33 utt3	and it's actually metal
b	B.34 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.35 utt1	it's not plastic.
sd	A.35 utt2	I didn't want to buy a plastic one.
aa	B.36 utt1	Yeah
sv	B.36 utt2	because those things I think would just snap you know.
b	A.37 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.39 utt1	But Payless Cashways has them
sd	A.39 utt2	and they're metal,
sd	A.39 utt3	and I don't know what affiliate of Payless Cashways you have up there,
sd	A.39 utt4	but it was only like seven dollars, not too bad.
b	B.40 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.40 utt2	I'd have to check into something like that, because, I mean, we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here, you know,
sd	B.40 utt3	but, you know, occasionally we have some around,
b	A.41 utt1	Yeah.
qy^g	B.42 utt2	but, you know, for other kind of cans, it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that, don't they.
ny	A.43 utt1	Yeah,
ny^r	A.43 utt3	yeah,
sd^e	A.43 utt4	I don't think it would crush steel cans,
sd	A.43 utt5	it's pretty tough.
b	B.44 utt1	Yeah,
h	B.44 utt2	so. I don't know,
sd	B.44 utt3	I don't think you have to crush the other ones for them to get to take that,
sd	B.44 utt4	but, I need to look into it more,
b	A.45 utt1	No,
sv	A.45 utt2	you could probably just, you know,
sd	B.46 utt3	sometimes, even with the newspaper they say they'll only take certain types of paper, you know,
sd	B.46 utt4	they won't take paper that's shiny,
b	A.47 utt1	Yeah
sd	A.49 utt1	yeah, they won't take any lint free paper
sd	A.49 utt2	or, see, I work at T I.
b	B.50 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.50 utt2	so does my husband,
sd	A.51 utt1	We do a lot of recycling out there.
b	B.52 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.53 utt1	Now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard,
sd	A.53 utt2	but that's just now come on board.
b	B.54 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.55 utt1	You know, we've been throwing paper out there away for years,
sd	A.55 utt2	and we're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big Earth Day thing came out, you know.
b	B.56 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.58 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.58 utt4	I'm sure they're probably doing that here some.
aa	A.59 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.59 utt2	I'm sure they are.
sd	A.59 utt3	T I is doing it pretty well nation wide, I'm sure.
b	B.60 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.60 utt2	I think it's necessary,
sd	B.60 utt3	I like it,
sd	B.60 utt5	I think it's good that you see these, you know, like boxes, cereal,
sd	B.60 utt6	they're now starting to make you know, the packages out of recycled paper,
sd	B.60 utt7	and, And you know, I've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper,
b	A.61 utt1	yeah.
sd	B.62 utt2	and I think they're just fine.
b	A.63 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.63 utt2	I bought a,
sd	A.63 utt3	I got one at work that I bought for one of the guys there at work,
sd	A.63 utt4	it's his birthday,
sd	A.63 utt5	we're pretty good friends,
sd	A.63 utt6	and what it is is a recycled paper bag
b	B.64 utt1	Uh huh.
 sd	A.65 utt1	and it's just got Happy Birthday printing on it, and a cute little phrase inside,
sd	A.65 utt2	and it's just a paper bag
b	B.66 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.67 utt1	you know, and it's really cute.
b	B.68 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.69 utt1	But, I think we're doing better and better all the time,
b	B.70 utt1	Yeah
sv	B.72 utt1	I think we're becoming more conscious because we just can't stick everything in landfills any more.
aa	A.73 utt1	No,
sv	A.73 utt2	there's not going to be any room, shortly.
aa	B.74 utt1	No,
aa^r	B.74 utt2	no,
sd	A.75 utt1	I don't know what New York does about theirs.
sv	A.75 utt2	I guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere.
aa	B.76 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.76 utt2	it's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere .
b	A.77 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.77 utt2	But I think we're getting better at it
b	B.78 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.79 utt1	I think there's quite a bit more we could do.
t3	B.80 utt1	Girls, put that away.
t3	B.80 utt2	Now.
sd	A.81 utt1	But, you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what it would be worth.
b	B.82 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.82 utt2	I just wish it was a little more convenient to do,
b	A.83 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.84 utt2	you know, seems like you're so busy anyway,
sd	B.84 utt3	and then that's just one more thing to have to worry about.
aa	A.85 utt1	Yeah,
ba	A.85 utt2	it sure is.
sv	B.86 utt1	I think if, you know, the cities, locally, you know, they'd get more programs going so that you could do that, it'd make it a lot easier.
b	A.87 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.87 utt2	yeah.
sv	A.87 utt3	Well, they'll get at it sooner.
sv	A.87 utt4	I guess the schools will get into it, too, sooner or later.
b	B.88 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.88 utt2	yeah,
sv	B.88 utt3	get the kids interested in it too.
sd	A.91 utt1	We tried to have an aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that I have,
sd	A.91 utt2	and we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans.
b	B.92 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.93 utt1	You know, if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people, sure they'll save them for us, there's no problem there.
b	B.94 utt1	Uh huh.
qh	A.95 utt1	But what do you do with them in the meantime?
ba	B.96 utt1	That's right.
sd	A.97 utt1	Now I don't want a garage full of cans .
ba	B.98 utt1	That's right,
qh	B.98 utt2	who does.
sv	B.98 utt3	You know people don't have room for that kind of stuff.
aa	A.101 utt1	No,
sv	A.101 utt2	they're not prepared for it.
aa	B.102 utt1	No,
sd	B.102 utt2	and in Texas, they're just get, things like that,
sd	B.102 utt3	they just get bugs in them.
aa	A.103 utt1	Yeah,
aa^r	A.103 utt2	yeah,
sd	A.103 utt3	they do.
sd	A.105 utt1	You know, the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get,
sd	A.105 utt2	that's for sure.
ba	B.106 utt1	That's right,
sd	B.108 utt1	I'm pretty lazy about it right now.
sd	B.108 utt2	Everything goes into one thing and goes out to the .
b	A.109 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.110 utt1	You know, pick it up.
b	A.111 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.111 utt3	About the only thing I really recycle around here is aluminum cans.
b	B.112 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.114 utt1	Well, I need to get better at it.
sv	A.115 utt1	Well, if we all try a little bit, a little bit goes a long way.
aa	B.116 utt1	Yeah,
ba	B.116 utt2	that's right,
ba^r	B.116 utt3	that's right.
sv	A.117 utt1	If everybody tries to do just a little bit, and a little bit more then we'll get there. thank you for talking to me.
ba	B.118 utt1	That's true.
ba	B.120 utt1	That's right.
fc	@A.121 utt1	Well
fc	B.124 utt1	Well, thank you for calling.
fc	A.125 utt1	Sure,
fc	A.125 utt2	no problem,
fc	B.126 utt1	Okay,
fc	B.126 utt2	take care.
