sd	A.1 utt1	the last movie that I saw,
sd	A.1 utt2	I don't go to that many
sd	A.1 utt3	so I'll just have to talk about the ones that I went to see,
sd	A.1 utt4	but, it was AWAKENINGS with, Robin Williams and, Peter DeNiro.
b	B.2 utt1	Okay.
b	B.4 utt1	Yes,
b	B.4 utt2	uh huh.
qy^d	A.5 utt1	Have you seen it.
nn	B.6 utt1	No
sd^e	B.6 utt2	unfortunately I haven't,
sd	B.6 utt3	I heard it's really good,
sv	A.7 utt1	It is.
sv	A.7 utt2	I just have to take my hat off to Peter DeNiro.
b	B.8 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.9 utt1	He is one of the best actors I've ever seen.
sd	A.9 utt4	the show is about these, catatonic type people that,
sd	A.9 utt5	this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the living, more or less,
sd	A.9 utt6	but it wears off.
b	B.10 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.11 utt1	And the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic, you know,
sd	A.11 utt2	it starts off with like a tic,
b	B.12 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.13 utt1	and then it gets to where he can't, you know, control his movements at all.
sd	A.13 utt2	And it was just so realistic.
sd	A.13 utt3	The way, you know, you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor.
b	B.14 utt1	Uh huh.
qw	B.14 utt2	What does,
 %	B.14 utt3	is
qy	B.14 utt4	Robin Williams, does he have a funny part in it?
nn	A.15 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.15 utt2	it was very se ,
qo^d	B.16 utt1	how does he do serious.
sv	A.17 utt1	He's good,
sv	A.17 utt2	he's talented,
fe	A.17 utt3	boy, he is.
sd	B.18 utt1	I've only seen him in funny stuff
b	A.19 utt1	I know,
sd	A.19 utt2	me too.
qw^d	A.19 utt3	But, well, what was that show, Garf ,
sd	A.19 utt4	I want to say Garfield
sd	A.19 utt5	but that wasn't it.
b	B.20 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.20 utt2	THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP.
aa	A.21 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.21 utt2	THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP.
qy^g	A.21 utt3	He wasn't always funny in that show, was he.
no	B.22 utt1	I didn't see the movie,
sd	B.22 utt2	I read the book
sd	A.23 utt1	I did too.
sd	A.23 utt2	That's why I was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part .
b	B.24 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.24 utt2	in fact, it got some pretty serious deep parts in it
b	A.25 utt1	Yeah,
b	A.25 utt2	right.
b	B.26 utt1	Yeah.
qw	A.27 utt1	Well what have you seen?
sd	B.28 utt1	I think the last movie that we went out to see was DANCES WITH WOLVES.
sd	A.29 utt1	I saw it.
b	B.30 utt1	Good,
sd	B.30 utt2	we've both seen one .
qy	B.30 utt3	Did you cry through it?
ny	A.31 utt1	Yes,
sd^e	A.31 utt2	the whole way .
sd(^q)	B.32 utt1	It was telling a friend, I said, I only cried twice,
^q	B.32 utt2	but each was about half an hour long,
qw^d	A.33 utt1	Where did you cry.
^h	B.34 utt1	let's see,
sd	B.34 utt2	each time that I thought that the Indians were going to get killed, I cried.
b	A.35 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.36 utt1	I cried the first time when the wagon man got killed, when they attacked him.
b	A.37 utt1	Uh huh,
b	A.37 utt2	yeah,
b^r	A.37 utt3	yeah.
sd	B.38 utt1	And, I think from there on, all the way through the movie.
^h	B.38 utt2	Let's see what else did it. what other parts.
sd	B.38 utt3	I can't remember any of the other parts right off now.
sd	A.39 utt1	I cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed .
sd	B.40 utt2	I don't remember when the horse got killed.
sd	A.41 utt2	when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him.
b	B.42 utt1	yeah.
sd	A.43 utt1	And then the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards, you know .
b	B.44 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.45 utt1	And that horse has been such a pal to him, when he was alone.
b	B.46 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.47 utt2	You can tell I'm an animal lover,
 sv	A.47 utt3	you can hear my dog .
sd	B.48 utt1	Unfortunately we don't have any animals,
b	A.49 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.49 utt2	It was a beautiful story,
sv	A.49 utt3	it really was.
sv	B.50 utt2	there was a lot of pretty scenery, too, in that movie.
b	A.51 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	A.51 utt2	uh huh.
qw^d	B.52 utt1	What did you think about the buffalo scenes.
sv	A.53 utt1	I thought it was awful, and so graphic,
aa	B.54 utt1	That was,
b	B.56 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.57 utt1	I mean I hadn't even imagined it, you know.
sv	A.57 utt2	I think we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo.
b	B.58 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.59 utt1	I had a friend who had fixed some, buffalo chili about a week before went to see the movie.
sd	A.61 utt1	Of course they raise them now, you know, to eat.
b	B.62 utt1	Uh huh,
b	B.62 utt2	yeah,
sd	A.63 utt1	But we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that.
b	B.64 utt1	Uh huh,
sd	B.64 utt2	well at least you know that it wasn't same situation that the buffalo died in.
aa	A.65 utt1	No
sd	A.65 utt2	it wasn't .
sv	B.66 utt1	I thought the scenes when the buffalos running, though, were beautiful,
sv	B.66 utt2	like that was great.
 aa	A.67 utt1	yeah.
sd	B.68 utt1	And there were so many of them.
sd	B.68 utt2	I didn't know that, that many buffaloes alive, much less in one place.
b	A.69 utt1	Yeah,
b	A.69 utt2	really.
sv	B.70 utt1	So that was pretty.
sd	A.71 utt1	And to think about how it just changed the whole landscape, you know, you could follow this beaten down path,
b	B.72 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.73 utt1	and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing.
sd	B.74 utt1	I wonder how they kept up with them, though,
sd	B.74 utt2	it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast.
aa	A.75 utt1	I know.
sd	B.76 utt1	I guess they graze, though,
sv	B.76 utt2	that wouldn't be a problem.
b	A.77 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.77 utt2	yeah.
qy^d	A.77 utt3	have you seen any of the behind the scenes, of that movie.
nn	B.78 utt1	No,
nn	B.78 utt2	huh uh.
sv	A.79 utt2	they tried to keep it, you know, as very close to real.
b	B.80 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.81 utt1	I mean like Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes
sd	A.81 utt2	and, they had to teach a wolf how to howl.
b	B.82 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.83 utt1	That's the, part they had trouble finding was wolves .
sv	B.84 utt1	I guess they're just not domesticated,
b	A.85 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.85 utt3	they just don't howl that much anymore.
sd	A.87 utt1	I could bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off
sd	A.87 utt2	and that's all they'd have to do .
b	A.89 utt1	Yeah.
ba	B.90 utt1	Well that's funny.
sv	A.91 utt1	Well, I think we've made it.
qy^d	B.92 utt1	is that five minutes,
no	A.93 utt1	I don't know,
qy	A.93 utt2	is it five or three.
bk	B.94 utt1	Okay,
no	B.94 utt2	I'm not sure.
sd	A.95 utt1	I'm not either.
b	B.96 utt1	Okay,
sv	B.96 utt2	well I think we're, we've done okay, though.
b	A.97 utt1	Okay,
aa	A.97 utt2	me too.
