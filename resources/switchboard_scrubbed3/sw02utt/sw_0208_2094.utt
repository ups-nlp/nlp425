qw	A.1 utt1	Robert what substances do you think are the most, likely causes of air pollution?
fe	B.2 utt1	gee,
sd	B.2 utt2	I don't, I mean,
sv	B.2 utt3	I guess it's the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust, you know,
sd	B.2 utt4	they say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that.
b	A.3 utt1	Right.
sd	B.4 utt1	So, I believe them
h	B.4 utt2	but I'm not a chemist.
qy	A.5 utt1	do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from, industrial areas, factories and so on?
no	B.6 utt1	I don't really know,
sd	B.6 utt2	I grew up in Los Angeles and have felt like I was victimized by air pollution.
sd	A.7 utt1	I was going to say,
qy^d	A.7 utt2	and you, so you understand smog .
na	B.8 utt1	I understand it very well
sd	B.8 utt2	and in fact I was a private pilot there,
b	A.9 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.10 utt1	and I can remember etched clearly in my mind, flying and coming up above the smog layer at about three thousand feet and looking back down and really being unbelieving at, what looked like a,
ba	A.11 utt1	Wow.
sv	B.12 utt2	it just looked liked peanut butter.
ba	A.13 utt1	My word.
sd	B.14 utt1	Thick and brown and so on.
qy^d	A.15 utt1	And that was, a few years ago?
na	B.16 utt1	This was quite a few years ago.
sd	B.16 utt2	This was in the nineteen sixties.
qy^d	A.17 utt1	I wonder if it's any better now. Because California has such strict rules, about emissions and so on.
sd	B.18 utt1	People say that it is somewhat better.
b	B.20 utt1	Right.
sd	A.21 utt2	I don't know if you re , heard about the, recent legislation in, Colorado, against a power company, that's actually on Indian land, I believe,
sd	A.21 utt3	but, it has been ruled against, regarding air pollution because they think that it's causing terrible smog over the Grand Canyon. And, particularly in the winter months.
sd	A.23 utt3	it was, a landmark case because it's unusual to,
sd	A.23 utt5	they were talking about shutting it down, if it didn't comply and so on.
qy	B.24 utt1	So did it burn coal?
no	A.25 utt1	I don't know that,
sd	A.25 utt2	the information is one of those wire services kind of pieces of news, you know,
sv	A.25 utt3	so it's hard,
sd	A.25 utt4	I never did see the full story,
sd	A.25 utt5	so I don't know.
b	B.26 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.27 utt1	But they said that it really caused so much smog over, the Grand Canyon in the winter months that they couldn't do the, piloting, you know, the helicopter trips and that sort of thing. Which would be horrible, because there's nothing,
b	B.30 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.31 utt2	I mean that's such a spectacle.
sv	A.31 utt3	It would be a shame to ruin it.
b^r	B.32 utt1	Yeah.
qw	A.33 utt1	what do you think individuals could do, or society could do to alleviate this problem.
sv	B.34 utt1	I don't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals. maybe just take good care of our cars, and make sure we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing.
b	A.35 utt1	Right.
sd	B.36 utt2	apart from that, I don't know what we can do as individuals.
qw	B.36 utt3	What do you think we can do?
b	A.37 utt1	Uh huh,
bf	A.37 utt2	you think, it's more to society.
sd	A.37 utt3	Well I guess I kind of agree there.
sv	A.37 utt5	on an individual basis there isn't a lot we can do about a lot of things
sv	A.37 utt6	but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can, force, government, that we elect to deal more seriously with it.
b	B.38 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.39 utt1	And I do think that we have a responsibility there.
sd	A.39 utt2	I must admit I'm not always real politically active
sv	A.39 utt3	but I do think that, Congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards.
b^r	B.40 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.41 utt1	And it's brought the,
sv	A.41 utt2	they, really listen to
sv	A.41 utt3	the, lobbyist and, the car manufacturing companies you know, have really pushed,
^q	A.41 utt5	all those restrictions are really too hard,
^q	A.41 utt6	we can't quite make that go
sd	A.41 utt8	and then we still live with air pollution.
b^r	B.42 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.43 utt1	so I suspect that that's one thing that as individuals, we can do, make our voices known, perhaps to our legislators.
sv	A.43 utt2	But, as a society, I think we can do more
sv	A.43 utt3	and that's probably how we ought to do it. being individually responsible in order to be group responsible.
b	B.44 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.44 utt2	I guess I'm to the point where I'm cynical enough that I really don't believe anything will happen unless there's something economically justifiable about it.
b	A.45 utt1	Right.
sd	B.46 utt1	And in the case of air pollution, it simply might turn out at some point down the road, to be so costly to have to live with air pollution in terms of health problems, and everything else that we'll spend the money that's necessary to get rid of the source of it.
b	A.47 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.49 utt1	I suspect that there's going to have to be a lot of pressure, come to bear on the companies that deal with it
sv	A.49 utt2	and probably the only way that can happen is for, governments to realize that they have to pay if companies don't.
b	B.50 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.51 utt1	And, I don't know how long that will take.
sv	B.52 utt1	People also have to realize they can't have their cake and eat it.
qh	B.52 utt2	So, if you don't want to burn coal for power, how about nuclear energy.
b	A.53 utt1	Sure.
sv	B.54 utt2	Well we don't want that either.
aa	A.55 utt1	Exactly,
aa	A.55 utt2	yeah,
aa	A.55 utt3	right.
qh	B.56 utt1	How about investing in the sun.
sv	B.56 utt2	Well nobody wants to pay twenty five cents a kilowatt hour, I don't think.
b	A.57 utt1	Right.
sv	B.58 utt1	I probably wouldn't mind if it really came down to it.
sv	A.59 utt1	Well it's just the same thing with the gasoline,
sv	A.59 utt2	now is a wonderful time to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline, so that we don't, run into the kind of problems we recently had
aa	B.60 utt1	yes,
aa^r	B.60 utt2	yes,
aa^r	B.60 utt3	yes.
sv	A.61 utt2	and yet the government is not going to do that because people are too dependent
sv	A.61 utt3	and they don't want to pay for it.
sv	A.61 utt4	So instead, we spend billions of dollars going to war.
aa	B.62 utt1	Yes.
h	A.63 utt2	however, it might have had other causes.
sv	A.63 utt3	Certainly oil was a big factor.
aa	B.64 utt1	certainly,
aa	B.64 utt2	yes.
sv	A.65 utt1	and I think that's probably going to happen with such things as air pollution, when we get serious about our motors in our automobiles then maybe, you know, we'll have a little bit of help.
b	B.66 utt1	Yeah.
qy	A.67 utt2	do you have any air pollution in your area?
ng	B.68 utt1	There's not really a lot here in Raleigh.
sd	B.68 utt2	once in a while we'll get some,
sv	B.68 utt3	I think it kind of washes down from your area Linda .
ba	A.69 utt1	no.
qy^d	A.71 utt1	Your talking about from the middle states, that have more factories and so on.
ny	B.72 utt1	Yeah.
ny	B.74 utt1	Yeah,
ny^r	B.74 utt2	yeah,
sd^e	B.74 utt3	that's what they say
sd	B.74 utt4	but it's not, it's not very usual
sd	B.74 utt5	and certainly we don't have the eye stinging variety that you get in the big cities.
b	A.75 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.75 utt2	we really don't have that either.
sv	A.75 utt3	I lived in this area for about twenty five years and I think I can tell a difference in the comfort level, particularly in the summer. you know, when it gets hot, and you have, that kind of a pressure from the pockets of air, usually they say caused by exhaust.
b	B.76 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	B.76 utt2	uh huh.
b	B.78 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.79 utt1	It seems to me that I'm more uncomfortable
sd	A.79 utt2	and, you know, my eyes sting more and so on and so on.
sv	A.79 utt3	So I suspect that it's an ever growing problem.
b^r	B.80 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.81 utt1	Well I suspect that we've probably covered everything that we need to here.
aa	B.82 utt1	Right,
sd	B.82 utt2	I think, we've given them about seven minutes according to my watch
fc	A.83 utt1	It was nice talking to you.
fc	B.84 utt2	and I enjoyed the conversation.
fc	A.85 utt1	So did I.
fc	A.85 utt2	Bye, bye.
fc	B.86 utt1	Bye.
