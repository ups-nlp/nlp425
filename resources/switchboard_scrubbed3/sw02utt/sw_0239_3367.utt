br	A.1 utt1	What?
qy^t	A.1 utt2	Do you want to start?
sd	B.2 utt1	you hit,
sd	B.2 utt2	it doesn't matter.
sd^t	B.2 utt3	we're discussing the capital punishment, I believe.
b	A.3 utt1	Right.
sd^t	A.3 utt2	You are right.
sv	A.3 utt4	I suppose I should have,
sd	B.4 utt2	I am pro capital punishment except that I don't like the way it's done.
 b	A.5 utt1	Uh huh.
 ^h	A.5 utt2	yeah,
sd	A.5 utt3	I guess, I hate to see anyone die,
b	B.6 utt1	Uh huh.
 sv	A.7 utt1	but, I guess these people that go around and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse, I don't think they deserve to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives.
aa	B.8 utt1	I agree.
sv	B.8 utt5	capital punishment is necessary in many cases
sv	B.8 utt7	it's not a deterrent, or our jails would not be so full.
sv	B.8 utt8	There wouldn't be so many people in Death Row.
b	A.9 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.10 utt1	I think it needs to be something, a throwback to where they did a, public execution where it's visible.
b	A.11 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.12 utt1	something, you know, not gruesome
sv	B.12 utt2	but something more where people know that it was a deterrent and it was equal for all people.
sv	B.12 utt3	If you committed a certain crime, you were going to receive a death penalty
sv	B.12 utt4	and it was going to happen to you.
b	A.13 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.14 utt1	No stays of execution.
sv	B.14 utt2	no loopholes,
sv	A.15 utt1	Well, and even that I don't really know if that would help.
sv	A.15 utt2	I think a lot of these people do it, mainly because of, of T V
 %	A.15 utt3	and, a ,
bf	B.16 utt1	Notoriety.
sv	A.17 utt1	the double reason they see it being done on T V and also the fact of notoriety.
sv	A.17 utt2	I mean, they become well known.
sv	A.17 utt3	They are almost like a big star.
b	B.18 utt1	yes,
sv	B.18 utt2	but they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal.
b	A.19 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.20 utt1	They know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years.
b	A.21 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.22 utt1	That they are going to write a book.
sv	B.22 utt2	They are going to go on talk shows
sv	B.22 utt4	that, that's a reward for a heinous crime rather than, having them pay the penalty which is forfeiture of their life.
b	A.23 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.25 utt1	Right.
sv	B.26 utt2	of any notoriety.
b	A.27 utt1	Yeah.
sv(^q)	A.27 utt2	Well, I, I think if they went according to, the BIBLE where it does say, an eye for an eye,
b	B.28 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.30 utt1	Right.
 +	A.31 utt1	a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life,
 sv	A.31 utt2	you take a life you give yours.
b	B.32 utt1	Right.
ba	A.33 utt1	that's for sure.
sv	A.33 utt2	there's exceptions to the rule
sv	A.33 utt3	I mean if it's an accidental taking then, you look at that
sv	A.33 utt4	but, you know, most of these people that down right go right and do it out of pure pleasure I don't, like to see that.
b	B.34 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.35 utt2	I guess also the fact that they say it's not a deterrent,
sv	A.35 utt3	it is a deterrent in the sense that that person will never do it again .
ar	B.36 utt1	Well, yes,
sd	B.36 utt2	they will.
sv	A.37 utt1	Not, not, not if he's killed he can't, do it again.
b	B.40 utt1	,
ba	B.42 utt1	well, that's correct,
b	B.42 utt2	yes.
sv	B.42 utt3	if he indeed receives the death penalty and it is executed.
b^m	A.43 utt1	The death penalty.
b	A.45 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.46 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.46 utt2	but the, the chances are not great that that will happen.
b	A.47 utt1	Right.
sv	B.48 utt1	But there's a greater chance that he'll be back out on the streets in twelve years.
b	A.49 utt1	Uh huh,
b	A.49 utt2	yeah.
sd	A.49 utt3	Well, I guess I'm also looking at beyond even that.
sd	A.49 utt4	I, I guess I been thinking about it
sd	A.49 utt5	and I don't have a definite opinion
sv	A.49 utt6	but, repeat, crimes maybe not the more mild ones but, you know, more severe ones especially on armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people, and not just taking the money but beating them half to death.
b	B.50 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.52 utt1	Uh huh.
ba	B.54 utt1	That's right.
^2	A.55 utt1	Just for pleasure too
sv	A.55 utt2	and I guess you've got to look at something like that.
aa	B.56 utt1	Yes.
bh	A.57 utt2	Do they deserve to, remain on this earth too?
sv	B.58 utt1	Why, you know, y , you could carry it to that if they are a repeat offender
sv	B.58 utt2	and you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going to do this.
sv	B.58 utt3	Unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up, you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes,
b	A.59 utt1	Right.
sd	B.60 utt1	and of course of battery or assault or, that is not a capital crime see.
sd	B.60 utt2	you wouldn't be able to under our system.
b	A.61 utt1	Right.
sv	B.62 utt1	Now China and a few other countries have a little different view of that.
sv	B.62 utt2	you get caught with dope there and you die, period.
b	A.63 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.63 utt2	Uh huh.
sv	B.64 utt1	there is no appeals.
