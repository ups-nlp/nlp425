o	A.1 utt1	Okay,
qw	A.1 utt2	so what kind of car are you thinking about getting?
sd	B.2 utt1	Well, none at the moment .
sd	A.3 utt1	Well, when you decide to.
o	B.4 utt1	No,
o	B.4 utt2	no,
o	B.4 utt3	no.
sd	B.4 utt4	I currently drive a Ford Taurus.
b	A.5 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.6 utt1	And I would imagine that if I change or if I get a new car, I will go with the Taurus or something similar, in that regard.
qy	A.7 utt1	So you like the Ford?
na	B.8 utt1	Absolutely.
sd	B.8 utt2	I have had it for about two years now
b	A.9 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.10 utt1	and it's everything it's supposed to be.
sd	B.10 utt2	I haven't had a minutes trouble with it
b	A.11 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.12 utt1	and, the only thing I have against it in that's it's a Taurus,
sd	B.12 utt2	but even after two years, I still feel uncomfortable driving it, because I had a Honda before that
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.14 utt1	and so it's a little bit larger.
b	A.15 utt1	Right.
sd	B.16 utt1	But that's the only difference that I see, really.
sd	B.16 utt3	my criteria at the moment it would be, American, personally,
b	A.17 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.17 utt2	Yeah,
sd	A.17 utt5	the car I had before this one was a Thunderbird as a matter of fact,
b	B.18 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.19 utt2	and, I loved it,
sd	A.19 utt3	I really did.
sd	A.19 utt4	But, I finally decided to go check out what the, foreign cars were.
sd	A.19 utt5	So I bought myself a, a Nissan a two forty S X.
b	B.20 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.21 utt2	But even though I love the car I've got now, I think my next car will probably be American again because if I can at all do it, I'd like to stay American,
b	B.22 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.23 utt2	I always have, up until now.
sd	A.23 utt3	I just for one time decided to go outside.
sd	B.24 utt1	Well, my wife still has a Honda Accord,
b	A.25 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.26 utt2	and it's an excellent automobile. but, you know, price and so forth,
b	A.27 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.28 utt2	I'm not a real car fan.
sd	B.28 utt3	So, I, I do not, opt for, something that would be, you know, expensive you know,
b	A.29 utt1	Right.
sd	B.30 utt2	I want something that's serviceable, something that I can use
b	A.31 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.32 utt2	and with the Taurus,
sd	B.32 utt3	I have a Taurus, L X,
sd	B.32 utt5	you're talking when you think about price, it's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable Honda or Nissan or something along those lines.
b	A.33 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.34 utt1	And as I said, as far I'm concerned, it has been extremely, serviceable and everything I wanted.
sv	A.35 utt1	Well, Ford's done a real good job in the last, say, ten years or at least the last five to six years, of really turning around their, quality, I think,
b	B.36 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	B.38 utt1	I think so too.
sd	B.38 utt3	in travel and renting automobiles in,
b	A.39 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.40 utt2	I've driven, you know, Chevrolet automobiles and Dodge,
sd	B.40 utt4	if it's Chevrolet, I just will not touch it.
sd	B.42 utt1	I had a Chevrolet before I bought my Taurus.
sd	B.42 utt2	I purchased a Chevy, Citation.
b	A.43 utt1	yeah,
sv	A.43 utt2	those were not good cars.
sd	B.44 utt1	And, I was ready to get rid of it two months after I bought it,
b	A.45 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.46 utt1	so I shopped around,
sd	B.46 utt2	and I probably, if I had thought I, wanted to pay the amount of money, I probably would have gone with, an Accord or even a Civic, or something comparable from Nissan or Toyota,
b	A.47 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.49 utt1	Right.
sd	B.50 utt3	I have a friend who, has an auto shop,
sd	B.50 utt4	and he purchased one of the first Sables that was, manufactured for his wife, a Sable station wagon,
sd	B.50 utt5	and he just absolutely swore by it.
b	A.51 utt1	Uh huh.
 sd	B.52 utt1	And it was upon his recommendation and so forth for, you know, comparably equipped, you know, with cruise control and air conditioning and A M F M radio, and all these other things
b	A.53 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.54 utt2	there was no comparison.
sd	B.54 utt3	the only thing that I find, you know, if I would have anything against it is that it still has that soft American ride.
b	A.55 utt1	Right.
sd	B.56 utt2	that's about the only thing I find, you know, disadvantageous to it.
sd	B.56 utt3	But, my criteria, is simply something that looks good, something that's serviceable,
sd	B.56 utt4	and you know, I drive around a lot,
sd	B.56 utt5	but, and you know, it's very comfortable on the highway.
sd	B.56 utt6	I can drive for, you know, ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way.
b	A.57 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.58 utt1	But those are my criteria,
sd	B.58 utt2	and I probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again,
sd	B.58 utt3	and if there's something out there that, is comparable to what I have now, I'll go ahead and get it.
b	A.59 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.59 utt2	You know, the only thing I'm looking, at right now,
sd	A.61 utt2	I just bought, you know, the Nissan that I've got about, say, nine months ago,
sd	A.61 utt4	So the only thing that would get me to change cars right now would be if,
sd	A.61 utt5	see, at the moment I'm single,
sd	A.61 utt6	and if I were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it.
sd	A.61 utt7	But, I don't have any plans for probably another two, three years of even looking, you know.
b	B.62 utt1	Uh huh.
 sv	A.63 utt1	cars are too expensive right now to, to even think about buying new cars every couple of years, you know
 %	B.64 utt1	I,
 b	B.64 utt2	yeah.
sd	B.66 utt1	In our parking lots, two or three days ago I saw one of the new Honda sports cars.
 b	A.67 utt1	Uh huh.
 sd	B.68 utt1	I can't remember what the name is.
sd	B.68 utt2	It's the thirty five or forty thousand dollar one, whatever it is,
sd	B.68 utt3	and it resembled a Mazaratti very, very closely.
sd	B.70 utt2	And it's an absolutely beautiful automobile and well appointed and so forth,
b	A.71 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.72 utt2	but to pay that much money for an automobile, is just,
sd	B.72 utt3	I can't conceive of doing that .
b	A.73 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.73 utt3	I went to a car show down here about two weeks ago,
sd	A.73 utt4	and, you know, of course they had the normal, the Ford, the Chevrolet, that stuff.
sd	A.73 utt5	But then you started looking at the,
sd	A.73 utt6	they had Ferrari there, they had, B M W and all these other kinds of cars.
sd	A.73 utt7	And Ferrari didn't even let you near the car,
sd	A.73 utt8	I mean, they were,
sd	A.73 utt9	that's how expensive they were.
b	B.74 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.75 utt1	And then you saw, hundred thousand dollar cars,
sd	A.75 utt2	you saw eighty thousand dollar cars,
sd	A.75 utt3	and even though I, I do enjoy cars, I enjoy, driving them, I enjoy, riding in them and everything, but, I can't see or paying more for a car than I would for a house, you know.
ba	B.76 utt1	That's true. Well,
sv	A.77 utt1	That doesn't seem likely.
sd	B.78 utt1	The difference there too, is between us is that I am not really crazy about driving.
b	A.79 utt1	Uh huh.
 sd	B.80 utt1	I never have been, since, you know, my parents had to force me to get my driver's license when I was young when I was sixteen.
b	A.81 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.82 utt2	So I've never really cared.
sd	B.82 utt4	before I was married and before I went to graduate school, I used to do little sports car racing.
sd	B.82 utt5	it was never my own car
b	A.83 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.84 utt1	it was always someone else's.
sd	B.84 utt2	And that sort of thing I enjoy,
sd	B.84 utt3	but to go out and drive, never has really had any appeal to me
b	A.85 utt1	Uh huh.
+	@B.86 utt1	in that regard.
sv	@B.86 utt2	So . Well I guess we've discussed that enough
qy^d	@B.86 utt3	don't you think.
na	A.87 utt1	I think so.
sd^t	B.88 utt1	we don't, we won't get the recorder or the, system to shut us off, tonight.
sd^t	B.88 utt2	That's happened to me almost every time I've,
sd^t	A.89 utt1	That's happened to me once,
sd^t	B.92 utt1	Well, it's very easy when you get on a topic that, you know, you enjoy.
b	A.93 utt1	Yeah,
sd^t	A.93 utt2	like, I think the one time I did it was on the Mid, the Mid East, the crisis out there.
 b	B.94 utt1	yeah.
 sd^t	A.95 utt1	That had a great conversation,
sd^t	A.95 utt2	but, then they came off and told us we couldn't do it any more.
sd^t	B.96 utt1	Well I was talking to a lady last evening,
sd^t	B.96 utt2	and we were talking about fishing,
sd^t	B.96 utt3	and, we were cut off, well,
sd^t	B.96 utt4	we were told to quit.
b	A.97 utt1	Yeah.
 b	B.98 utt1	Okay.
 fc	B.98 utt2	Well, you have a pleasant evening.
 	fc        A.99 utt1	You too.
fc	B.100 utt1	Take care.
fc	A.101 utt1	Bye bye.
fc	B.102 utt1	Good bye.
