ad	A.1 utt1	Go ahead.
aa	B.2 utt1	Okay,
o	B.2 utt2	do I still can feel that the Soviet Union, as such, is still a threat to the civilized western world?
na	B.2 utt3	Absolutely.
sd	B.2 utt4	And my reasons are based upon not only what I see on the newspapers, but up against some of the, fun and exciting things I ran into during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group.
b	A.3 utt1	Okay.
sv	A.3 utt2	I guess I don't see them as much of a threat as they used to be,
sv	A.3 utt3	but I think just the instability of the country right now is, sort of scary.
sv	B.4 utt1	Well, that's what makes it a powder keg.
sd	B.4 utt3	I'll go back in time a little bit, to about eighty one, when my first real involvement with the military started.
b	A.5 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.6 utt2	naturally we were at the time,
sd	B.6 utt3	the Soviet Union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat.
sd	B.6 utt4	So we got quite a bit of information as well as indoctrination on Soviet tactics and weapons.
b	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.8 utt1	I went to Lebanon in eighty three, before the marines ever got there, with the U N Peace Keeping Force. with the training I received prior to going there, with captured weapons we kept running up against.
sd	B.8 utt2	these weren't Chinese made copies.
sd	B.8 utt3	These were Soviet made, top of the line, fresh out of the box, A K forty sevens. As well as a lot of the explosives we were running into.
b	A.9 utt1	uh huh.
sd	B.10 utt2	In Granada, in October, twenty fifth, eighty three, we invaded the place.
sd	B.10 utt3	Sure there were Cuban soldiers there,
sd	B.10 utt4	but there was also a bunch of Russian advisors that were damn good shots.
sd	B.10 utt5	The team I was with, we jumped in on the western tip of the island down on Point Salinas.
sd	B.10 utt6	And for every Cuban there was at least five Russian advisors.
sd	B.12 utt1	And they were all shooting state of the art Soviet weapons.
sd	B.12 utt2	In eighty four, I was down in Central America, as an advisor to the Honduran Army.
sd	B.12 utt3	Again we were running up against Cubans quite a bit, plus Soviet advisors.
sd	B.12 utt4	And the equipment we were capturing and taking from the Nicaraguans, was brand new, out of the crate, Soviet made material.
qy	B.12 utt5	Do I consider them a threat?
na	B.12 utt6	Absolutely.
sd	B.12 utt7	They have a university in Moscow called the Patrice de Lamumba University.
sd	B.12 utt8	About like A and M or U T, where they're teachings subjects like that, they're teaching terrorism.
sd	B.12 utt9	Some of the people we went up against in Lebanon were graduates from that place.
sd	B.12 utt10	And let me tell you, they are nothing nice to go up against.
sd	B.14 utt1	I'm surprised during this Iraqi crisis we didn't have more incidents than they did.
sd	B.14 utt2	These guys are top of the line.
sd	B.14 utt3	when they graduate from there, they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world.
sd	B.14 utt4	And they are very, very good at what they do.
sv	B.14 utt5	So until I see the entire, quote, old guard of the Soviet government completely roll over and disappear, preferably buried, I still consider them a threat.
b	A.15 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.16 utt1	Their military is different from ours, to where there are extremist generals that actually control tens and thousands of troops.
sv	B.16 utt3	irregardless of what Soviet policy is, they're going to do what the general tells them.
b	A.17 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.17 utt2	I guess that's what concerns me the most. Is they're so unstable that somebody like that could make, decisions that would jeopardize a lot of people.
sd	B.18 utt1	Well, it's interesting watching the different Soviet states, Albania, Lithuania, doing their little revolts down there.
b	A.19 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.20 utt1	Each one of those sectors has got a Soviet general over the troops that are there.
sd	B.20 utt2	So far they haven't run into the real psychos yet.
sd	B.20 utt3	There's probably five or six, which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs, that are in positions over some of these Soviet states.
sv	B.20 utt4	If uprisings happen in their sectors, it's going to be a total blood bath.
b	A.21 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.21 utt2	it looks like it's come close to that as it is.
sv	B.22 utt1	Actually, they're showing remarkable restraint.
sd	B.22 utt2	They get real nasty, the hyundee helicopters come out
sd	B.22 utt3	and they, would level entire areas.
b	B.22 utt4	Okay,
qy^g	B.22 utt5	you're from the Dallas area, right?
ny	A.23 utt1	Uh huh.
bk	B.24 utt1	Okay,
qy^d	B.24 utt2	you know, basically the size of, the area around Richardson?
ny	A.25 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.26 utt1	You put five Soviet hyundee helicopters in the air, they can level the entire area
sd	B.26 utt2	and there won't be anything left alive.
sd	B.26 utt3	And they can do that in about four minutes.
sd	B.28 utt1	And they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by.
sd	B.28 utt2	They used them in Afghanistan, did remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in.
sd	B.28 utt3	But on a highly populated area, like some of the Soviet cities would be, with the weaponry that's attached on those things, there is no place to hide.
sd	B.28 utt4	If the bombs don't get you, if the bullets don't get you, then the nerve gas definitely will get you.
sd	B.28 utt5	The only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time.
sd	B.28 utt6	They drink that much fuel.
b	A.29 utt1	Uh huh.
qy^d	B.30 utt3	I take it you haven't spent any time in the military?
nn	A.31 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.31 utt2	I haven't.
sd	B.32 utt1	As a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military,
sd	B.32 utt2	I know a lot of this stuff that I was involved in, never did make the newspapers.
b	A.33 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	B.34 utt1	But, during that same time frame, didn't you get some feeling, that, I mean, they're getting all these weapons and stuff?
qy	B.34 utt2	Didn't it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff?
qy	A.35 utt1	You mean in the most recent conflict?
sd	B.36 utt1	In any of them since eighty one.
ny	A.37 utt1	Yeah,
na	A.37 utt2	definitely.
sd	A.37 utt3	I'm, I'm a little bit shocked to what the U S has done in terms of selling to Iraq in the past ten to fifteen years.
sv	A.37 utt5	I think we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too.
sv	A.37 utt6	It's bad enough that the Soviets do it.
sv	B.38 utt1	It all boils down to, whether it's our side, their side,
sv	B.38 utt2	it's a matter of money, to a certain extent.
b	A.41 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.42 utt1	The deal the Iraqi's have with the Russians was for oil.
b	A.43 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.43 utt2	It's scary to know that they're supplying that many people with weapons. Especially when it's to the south of us.
sd	B.44 utt1	the ones to the south are more regional conflict.
sd	B.44 utt2	They're not really that worried about invading north.
sd	B.44 utt3	They're more interested in,
sd	B.44 utt4	they've got a screwed up situation, I'll give them that. From Mexico all the way down into Central and South America.
sv	B.44 utt5	The situation down there is weird
sv	B.44 utt6	and it's very screwed up.
b	A.45 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.46 utt1	Inflation is out of this world
sd	B.46 utt2	and the governments, which our government has technically supported for years, are corrupt as all get out.
 sd	B.46 utt3	And generally the people, are getting screwed,
sd	B.48 utt2	and they're tired of it,
sv	B.48 utt3	and they're willing to try anything to get out from under it, even if that means going to communism.
b	A.49 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.49 utt2	Well, I think Russia is getting to the point where they're about to do something to get out of communism.
sd	A.49 utt3	I guess I'd would like to see somebody like Yeltsin to get more power.
sv	A.49 utt4	I think Gorbachev has about had his day.
sv	B.50 utt1	Unfortunately, Yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard.
sv	B.50 utt2	That's the only drawback that I see with the entire thing.
 b	A.51 utt1	Yeah.
 sv	B.52 utt1	Gorbachev has made his attempt
sv	B.52 utt2	and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself.
b	A.53 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.54 utt1	Yeltsin's in tight with the old guard.
sv	B.54 utt2	So it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils, at this point.
b	A.55 utt1	Uh huh.
ba	A.57 utt1	True .
h	A.57 utt2	I don't know,
sd	A.57 utt3	I sure wouldn't turn my back on them.
 %	B.58 utt1	You mean,
sd	B.58 utt2	I understand when or they reduced the number of troops in Europe after the Berlin Wall went down,
sv	B.58 utt3	I thought that was great.
sd	B.58 utt4	But by no means do I endorse or approve pulling everybody out.
b	A.59 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.60 utt1	It may be a much reduced force than what we used to have over there.
sv	B.60 utt2	But you still better have the key players in place, if something does go down. Even if it's a regional conflict.
sv	B.60 utt3	If United States is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is, not only does it talk the talk, but it's got to be able to walk the walk.
sv	B.60 utt4	It's got to have the stuff to back up what it's saying.
sv	B.60 utt5	If you've only got a token force there, you can't hold your ground.
sv	A.61 utt1	At least they're learning a little bit from history.
