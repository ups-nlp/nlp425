o	A.1 utt1	Okay,
qy	A.1 utt2	do you subscribe to magazines yourself?
sd	B.2 utt1	I don't, subscribe to any magazines at home, because we get so many at work that, I need to read that, I just don't take any at home.
bk	A.3 utt1	I see.
sd	A.3 utt2	I get, MCCALL'S.
 sd	A.3 utt3	Of course, anything that appeals to the homemaker since that's my main line of interest.
b	B.4 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.5 utt1	And then once in a while I'll pick up a WORKING WOMAN or something and realize why I don't want to go back to work . What I enjoy about staying home.
b	B.6 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.10 utt1	Right.
sd	A.11 utt1	And, I read magazines mainly because they're fast
 sd	A.11 utt2	and if I want to relax while I watch T V,
 sd	A.11 utt3	of course, I'm one of those that does two things at once,
sd	A.11 utt4	and, I read GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and BETTER HOMES and MCCALL'S.
 	sd        A.11 utt5	And I like them because they're kind of short and to the subject.
 b	B.12 utt1	Right.
sd	B.12 utt2	I used to take MCCALL'S and GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and, several magazines like that a few years ago at, at home.
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
qy^d	A.13 utt2	And then you stopped them all.
ny	B.14 utt1	But, yeah,
 sd	B.14 utt2	the subscriptions ran out
 	sd        B.14 utt3	and I never renewed them.
sd	B.14 utt4	And I found that I really didn't have time at home since I work, to read them.
sd	A.15 utt1	I find that, about two years is probably my max on subscribing to one in particular
b	B.16 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.17 utt2	and then I kind of get turned off by it. Other than GOOD HOUSEKEEPING.
b	B.18 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.19 utt2	GOOD HOUSEKEEPING is the one that kind of sets around for when I'm really have time and I really want to read something, you know.
 b	B.20 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.21 utt1	I don't get into books too often because I have so many things that I stay occupied with on a general basis,
b	B.22 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.23 utt2	and we travel a lot
sd	A.23 utt3	so I enjoy reading parts on travel in the various you know, different ones.
b	B.24 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.26 utt1	Right.
sd	A.27 utt1	And I get into, newspapers,
 sd	A.27 utt2	so I guess that kind of tells you what kind of person I am.
sd	A.27 utt3	I'm, read it fast and put it down .
b	B.28 utt1	Right.
b	B.28 utt2	Uh huh.
sd	B.28 utt3	when I had my magazines at home, I would find that I kind of skimmed through them and looked at the pictures, you know,
 sd	B.28 utt4	and if something caught my eye, then I might read something,
 b	A.29 utt1	Right.
sd	B.30 utt2	but otherwise than that, you know, they were, you know, not too useful to me. You know
 sd	A.31 utt1	Well,
 	sd        B.32 utt1	I got some good recipes from them sometimes,
 	%       B.32 utt2	but
 	x       B.32 utt3	,
 	+       A.33 utt1	That's what I do.
 	sv       A.33 utt2	You clip recipes
 	sv       A.33 utt3	and you save them forever
 	sv      A.33 utt4	and you never really
 	b        B.34 utt1	Uh huh.
 	+        A.35 utt1	use them.
 	ba        B.36 utt1	That's right,
 	ba       B.36 utt2	that's right.
 	sv        A.37 utt1	And then every so often you weed through them
 sv	A.37 utt2	and you think, where did I ever put that recipe.
b	B.38 utt1	Right.
sd	A.39 utt1	But, that's mainly my, whole idea on
 b	B.40 utt1	Uh huh.
 +	A.41 utt1	you know, short subject, reading and things like this.
 sd	A.41 utt2	I subscribe, like I said, to a few
 sd	A.41 utt3	and once in a while I buy that new magazine called FIRST on the newsstands
 	b        B.42 utt1	Uh huh.
 	+        A.43 utt1	or something like that.
 	sd        A.43 utt2	But I kind of stay with my own subject matter what, pertains to my daily life
 	b       B.44 utt1	Right.
 	+        A.45 utt1	at the present time.
 	sd        B.46 utt1	Well, since I work with computers during my work, I have to keep up on all the new computer equipment and software and everything.
 	sd        B.46 utt2	And I have to read the magazines, you know, such as BYTE, and COMPUTER WORLD and MAC WORLD and all of these, , magazines such as that,
 	%       B.46 utt3	so I really, you know, just,
 	sd       B.46 utt4	I can see that it will be a very long time, probably, before I subscribe to any magazines at home.
 	b       A.47 utt1	Right.
 	sv        A.47 utt2	Well, sometimes, you know, if you're in public transportation
 	b        B.48 utt1	Uh huh.
 	+        A.49 utt1	I know that people will read them on something like that.
 	b        B.50 utt1	Right.
 	sv        A.51 utt1	But I think,
 	sv        A.51 utt2	and the idea is good,
 	sd        A.51 utt3	I can just dump them at the other end ,
 	sd        A.51 utt4	and I don't have to carry them back with me.
 	ba        B.52 utt1	That's right.
 sd	A.53 utt1	I do that when we travel.
 sd	A.53 utt2	I always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we
 	b        B.54 utt1	Uh huh.
 +	A.55 utt1	drive or wherever we,
sd	A.55 utt2	no matter what it is, air travel or anything and I,
b	B.56 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.56 utt2	Right.
sd	B.56 utt3	if I go on an airplane ride or something, I'll stop in and pick up you know, a COSMOPOLITAN or something to read on the airplane.
 b	A.57 utt1	Right,
sd	B.58 utt2	But, you know, that's basically just about ,
 sd	B.58 utt3	I'll buy a crossword puzzle magazine every now and then .
 	sv        A.59 utt1	That's when you really have time.
 	sd        A.59 utt2	Now see your computer ones,

 	b        B.60 utt1	Uh huh.
 	sd        A.61 utt1	and I tried, reading the magazines hoping I would get more from it
sd	A.61 utt2	and it was just above my head without having someone there to give me the advice as I went along.
 b	B.62 utt1	Uh huh.
 sd	A.63 utt1	It was, you know, kind of a little bit more than what I needed,
 sd	A.63 utt2	so I never did get into them.
 sd	A.63 utt3	, when I bought the computer, all of a sudden I was receiving them, for some unknown reason, through the mail.
 sd	A.63 utt4	I think they all thought, well, we have a live one . She'll subscribe .
 	b        B.64 utt1	Uh huh.
 sd	A.65 utt1	But they were wrong.
 sd	A.65 utt2	I never got into them.
