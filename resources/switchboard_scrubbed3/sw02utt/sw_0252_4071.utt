sv	A.1 utt1	Well Jackie, on taxes, I guess I would have to say, that my opinion is that I do think American's are paying too much in taxes.
qo	A.1 utt2	what's your feeling about that?
aa	B.2 utt1	I agree.
sv	B.2 utt2	I think taxes are high.
b	A.3 utt1	Right,
qy	A.3 utt2	where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both?
ny	B.4 utt1	yes.
b	B.4 utt2	Uh huh.
bk	A.5 utt1	uh huh.
sd	A.5 utt2	In New Hampshire we have, no, what we call broad base taxes.
sd	A.5 utt3	No income tax and no sales tax.
b	B.6 utt1	Huh.
sd	A.7 utt1	we tax business, eight percent,
sd	A.7 utt2	businesses are taxed eight percent
sd	A.7 utt3	and we have what we call the five B s. for our taxes. Booze, butts, cigarettes, beds, hotel room tax bellies, a meal tax and bets, gambling.
b	B.8 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.10 utt1	Oh.
 sd	A.11 utt1	So, we do have a very low tax rate,
sv	A.11 utt2	but you know, combined with the federal income tax. I think that American's generally do pay too much in taxes
b	B.12 utt1	Right.
b	B.12 utt2	Yeah,
aa	B.12 utt3	I agree
sv	B.12 utt4	and I, think it's about the time of the year when you just start getting,
sv	B.12 utt5	well if you do get money back from like jobs,
sd	B.12 utt6	I'm still a student so, I only work part time,
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh .
sd	B.14 utt2	so I get a check back
ba	A.15 utt1	Well that's nice.
sd	B.16 utt1	from taxes
sv	A.17 utt1	nice to get a refund.
aa	B.18 utt1	Yeah .
sv	B.18 utt2	It is,
sd	B.18 utt3	but it's not much.
b	A.19 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.19 utt2	Do you think that, for whatever taxes we do pay that, we are getting value for it?
nn	B.20 utt1	No.
aa	A.21 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.21 utt2	my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to Washington or to the state
sv	A.21 utt3	and they say they are going to send some back,
sv	A.21 utt4	it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion.
b	B.22 utt1	Yeah.
bh	A.23 utt1	You know what I mean?
ny	B.24 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.25 utt2	I should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because, Right because, there's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there's a fly paper effect
b	B.26 utt1	Yeah.
ba	B.26 utt2	There you go .
sv	A.27 utt2	and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first
sv	A.27 utt3	and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol, a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you.
b	B.28 utt1	Right,
b	B.28 utt2	yeah.
h	B.30 utt1	I don't know.
sv	B.30 utt3	don't seem like they are doing much with it,
sv	B.30 utt4	I mean there's plans there
sv	B.30 utt5	and now that they are voting and people, you know, getting into drug and that stuff.
b	A.31 utt1	Uh huh.
 sv	B.32 utt1	They have nice plans
sv	B.32 utt2	but, they don't always work
sv	B.32 utt3	and then you know they try to raise taxes more
sv	B.32 utt4	and I don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work,
sd	B.32 utt5	you know, but taxes get raise
h	B.32 utt6	so. I don't know.
sd	B.32 utt7	I'm not really into politics,
sd	B.34 utt1	I don't really understand it
b	A.35 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.37 utt1	Well, it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend.
sv	A.37 utt2	it's almost like they will spend as much as they're allowed to collect. You know.
b	B.38 utt1	Right.
sd	A.39 utt1	there is an interesting proposal that's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax. ten percent or thirteen percent.
sd	A.39 utt2	There would be no figuring.
sd	A.39 utt3	I mean you would take your income tax,
sd	A.39 utt4	you would have a certain amount,
sd	A.39 utt5	I mean you would take you total salary
b	B.40 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.41 utt1	those who made under a certain amount wouldn't owe any taxes,
sd	A.41 utt2	and then there would be a set amount for however many you know, dependent you have,
sd	A.41 utt3	and you would just pay a flat tax. No exemptions, no deductions or anything else you know, after you figure up who's in your family.
b	B.42 utt1	Right.
b	B.42 utt2	Huh.
sv	A.43 utt1	And that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the I R S
sv	A.43 utt2	and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with.
b	B.44 utt1	Yeah.
ba	B.44 utt2	The could be nice .
b	A.45 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.46 utt1	Huh.
sv	A.47 utt1	I'd like to see something like that.
sv	A.47 utt2	I think it would be fairer
sv	A.47 utt3	and it would put you know, a lot of the tax attorneys our of business
sv	A.47 utt4	and I am sure they will fight it tooth and nail,
sv	A.47 utt5	but I really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans.
b	B.48 utt1	Right,
b	B.48 utt2	yeah.
sd	A.49 utt1	I mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes.
b	B.50 utt1	Right,
b	B.50 utt2	huh.
sd	A.51 utt1	It doesn't seem fair to me.
aa	B.52 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.52 utt2	it isn't,
sv	B.52 utt3	there is not much out there that is fair,
sv	B.52 utt4	that's for sure.
b	A.53 utt1	Right.
aa	B.54 utt2	I will agree to that.
qy^g	A.55 utt1	I think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high. I, if I am not mistaken, aren't they? {E I mean } for your state.
qy	A.57 utt2	do you know what your state income tax rate is?
nn	B.58 utt1	no
qy^d	A.59 utt1	Twenty percent?
no	B.60 utt1	I have no idea,
sd	B.60 utt3	My dad does it all for me .
bf	A.61 utt1	you just pay it, .
sv	A.63 utt1	you're like my daughter who is in college down in Massachusetts
sv	A.63 utt2	and, she works as a waitress
sd	A.63 utt3	and she is attending college full time also
b	B.64 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.65 utt1	and she sends her taxes to me
sd	A.65 utt2	and I figure them up.
sd	A.65 utt3	She really has no idea.
sd	A.65 utt4	She gets a refund check
