o	B.1 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.2 utt1	I haven't, talked to anybody outside the Metroplex,
sd	A.2 utt2	so I didn't even think of saying Arlington, Texas.
sd	A.4 utt1	This is a real first .
b	B.5 utt1	Yes.
qy	A.6 utt1	Are you at work?
ny	B.7 utt1	Yes,
sd^e	B.7 utt2	I am.
sd	A.8 utt1	I, I've been trying to get people at five thirty and six thirty in the evening
sd(^q)	A.8 utt2	and I thought, well, I'm not having any luck,
^q	A.8 utt3	I'll try the middle of the afternoon.
sd	B.9 utt1	Well, I'm happy we got through.
aa	A.10 utt1	I am, too.
qy	A.10 utt2	Well, do you have any, opinion on the subject?
sd	B.11 utt1	Well, I'm especially interested with what's happening in the Soviet Union,
sv	B.11 utt2	the move to, the, the, Ukraine's vote basically to secede and set itself up independently is quite a remarkable, counts,
^2	A.12 utt1	Democracy.
b	A.14 utt1	Oh.
qy	B.15 utt2	is that reported in the Texas papers?
na	A.16 utt1	sure,
sd	A.16 utt2	we hear a little of the news .
sd	A.16 utt4	I have heard about that the last couple of days.
qw	A.16 utt5	how big is the Ukraine, the area,
qy	A.16 utt6	do you know?
sd	A.18 utt2	I'm really uninformed.
sd	B.19 utt1	I'm afraid I don't have the statistics in front of me.
b	A.20 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.21 utt1	, it's not a tiny area.
sd	B.21 utt2	if I was looking at a U S map, I would say it sort of reminds me of a,
sd	B.21 utt3	it's not as big as California proportionately.
b	A.22 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	A.22 utt2	uh huh.
sv	B.23 utt1	but, but it's more significant, in the sense of, it's a great agricultural region.
b	A.24 utt1	I see,
sd	A.24 utt2	I didn't really know that,
qy^g	A.24 utt3	I know a lot of their countries that they had overtaken, or wanted to be independent or several of them, right,
ny	B.25 utt1	Yeah.
qw	A.26 utt1	And, what about Astonia,
qy	A.26 utt2	are they,
sd	B.27 utt1	They're completely out now.
aa	A.28 utt1	Right,
sd	A.28 utt2	I thought they were.
aa	B.29 utt1	Yes,
sd	B.29 utt2	the three Baltic, republics got out as quickly as they could.
qy^d	A.30 utt1	but, the Ukraine is especially significant because of the agriculture?
na	B.31 utt1	Right,
sv	B.31 utt2	it's very important for the economics of the Soviet Union.
qy^d	A.32 utt1	so there were probably really fight to keep it in if they could.
na	B.33 utt1	Right,
sv	B.33 utt2	except they can't fight .
aa	A.34 utt1	No,
sd	A.34 utt2	they don't,
sd	B.35 utt1	It's done democratically,
qy^g	A.36 utt1	And Bush has already given his opinion on it, right?
ny	B.37 utt1	Yes.
qy	A.38 utt1	Didn't I read that?
ny	B.39 utt1	Yes.
sv	A.40 utt1	So, now, not that may matter,
h	A.40 utt2	I don't know, anymore.
sd	A.40 utt3	I, fear for the Russians from what I read, you know,
sd	A.40 utt4	I wonder how they're going to get through the winter. Food wise or any wise,
sv	A.42 utt2	sounds to me like they'll start rioting soon, or not that that would do any good,
sv	A.42 utt3	but I guess people do that when they're desperate.
sv	B.43 utt1	that's true, hasn't happened here for a while,
aa	A.44 utt1	Well, that's true,
sd	A.44 utt2	since the Depression,
sv	A.44 utt3	I guess when the veterans went to Washington
b	B.45 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.46 utt1	and well, you know, the war riots, of course.
ad	A.46 utt2	Let's just hope we don't get to that point .
sd	A.48 utt1	Things are not so good in Texas job wise.
aa	B.49 utt1	No,
sd	B.49 utt2	I've heard they're, I hear you have some problems.
sd	A.50 utt1	Well, we do.
sd	A.50 utt2	We have lots and lots of, layoffs here. Lot of companies folding, lot of layoffs
sv	A.50 utt3	and it's pretty scary.
qy	B.51 utt1	do you, do you blame the government in Washington for this?
sd	A.52 utt1	Well, I don't understand economics that well.
no	A.52 utt2	I don't know,
sd	A.52 utt3	I know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we don't
b	B.53 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.54 utt1	and so I assume that that has some effect. Or a great effect.
b	B.55 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.57 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.58 utt1	And I mean, they said during the way, Reagan Bush years, the rich got richer,
sd	A.58 utt2	the poor got poorer,
sd	A.58 utt3	the statistics prove that
qy	B.59 utt1	So then, it's, you think it's Reagan and Bush have done this
qrr	B.59 utt2	or is it just coincidence it was during this period?
no	A.60 utt1	Well, I really don't know.
sd	A.60 utt2	I think maybe they contributed to it.
sv	A.60 utt3	Maybe they should pay more attention or, you know, to the more equalization of the trade.
b	B.61 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.62 utt1	Of course, if somebody in China can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have unions, well, I don't know what's going to happen then.
aa	B.63 utt1	the Chinese use slave labor, too.
b	A.64 utt1	Right.
sv	B.65 utt1	that's one of the ways they get away with it.
^2	A.66 utt1	And child labor.
aa	B.67 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.68 utt1	Right.
sd	A.68 utt2	Well, I don't know.
qw	A.68 utt3	What do you think has caused our horrible situation?
sv	B.69 utt1	I don't think there's any one simple answer to the whole thing.
^2	A.70 utt1	One thing.
sv	B.71 utt2	I mean that's very complicated.
b	A.72 utt1	Right,
sd	A.72 utt2	well, they say, too, that having a democratic congress and republican President is not good.
sd	A.72 utt3	I mean, I've read that is a theory.
qw	B.73 utt1	So which one are we going to throw out?
sd	A.74 utt1	Well, I hate to say it,
sd	A.74 utt2	but, I'm tending to go straight back into my original democratic party.
b	B.75 utt1	Uh huh.
qy^g	B.77 utt1	Texas used to be a democratic state, didn't it?
sd	A.78 utt1	I know,
sv	A.78 utt2	it used to,
aa	A.78 utt3	right.
sv	A.78 utt4	Well, you don't want too many democrats anymore
sd	A.78 utt5	and for a while I kind of deserted the party,
sd	A.78 utt6	but now it's looking better to me.
sd	B.79 utt1	I like your governor.
bh	A.80 utt1	do you?
sd	A.80 utt2	I'm glad to hear that.
sv	B.81 utt1	She's an impressive woman.
aa	A.82 utt1	Well, I think so, too.
sd	A.82 utt2	I just, admire her a lot.
b	B.83 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.84 utt1	And, I really hope she does well.
sv	A.84 utt2	But she's, you know, probably more popular out of the state than she is here, although she did manage to win.
b	B.85 utt1	Right .
ad	A.86 utt1	But look who she was running against, you know .
b	B.87 utt1	Well, yeah,
sv	B.87 utt2	anybody could beat Claytie in Texas.
sv	A.88 utt1	He shot himself in the foot so many times .
qw^t	@A.90 utt1	How did you get on this T I thing?
sd	B.91 utt1	I know some of the people.
