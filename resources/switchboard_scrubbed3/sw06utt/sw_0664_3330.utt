o	A.1 utt1	Jay,
sd	A.1 utt2	my kids are both in college,
sd	A.1 utt3	and I played a fairly active part in helping them decide where to go.
sd	A.1 utt4	On the other hand, they really decided themselves.
b	B.2 utt1	Uh huh.
qo	A.3 utt1	what kind of experience did you have?
sd	B.4 utt2	one girl went in state and has graduated,
sd	B.4 utt3	and then, you know, that was her choice pretty much where she wanted to go
b	A.5 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.6 utt1	and I have, two out of state, both in Missouri,
sd	B.6 utt2	and, I teach, in a college,
sd	B.6 utt3	and so they had heard me talk about it, and for years, that I didn't think it really made too much difference where they went for their undergraduate.
b	A.9 utt1	I see,
h	A.9 utt2	well, may, maybe I'm wrong,
sv	A.9 utt3	but I think it makes a big difference in terms of finding a school that is sort of right for the child in terms of his or her happiness and, and, and the appropriate support environment and things like that.
^2	B.10 utt1	if they're content there,
sv	B.12 utt1	I mean as far as the education, as far as looking at the degree at the end, it's very little difference is paid to it, where you get that bachelor's.
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.14 utt2	if it's a halfway decent school they should be happy naturally,
b	A.15 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.16 utt2	and if they can get, two out of,
sd	B.16 utt3	let's see, my son got a full total scholarships
b	A.17 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.18 utt1	and so there's plenty of scholarships out there,
sv	B.18 utt2	and so people should be advised to look for those,
qy	A.19 utt1	did you play a strong role in helping them pick schools
qrr	A.19 utt2	or did you just sort of say listen to your guidance counselors
^h	B.22 utt1	Well, they,
sd	B.22 utt2	we went around,
sd	B.22 utt3	my son was a, graduated from a Jesuit high school
b	A.23 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.24 utt1	and so he was pretty much looking for a Jesuit university,
b	A.25 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.26 utt2	that was limited to five or six different places
sd	B.26 utt3	so he's in Saint Louis U,
sv	B.26 utt4	and I guess I played a role in that.
sd	B.26 utt5	I just sort of, let them, you know,
sd	B.26 utt6	they'd all been, pretty efficient as far as studies
b	A.27 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.28 utt2	and, so I didn't have that much to do,
sd	B.28 utt3	they just, they just knew they wanted to go to college,
b	A.29 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.30 utt2	and I, you know, helped them get there as far as traveling with them to look at different places.
b	A.31 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.33 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.34 utt2	We did do that,
sd	B.34 utt3	and I would suggest a person always goes and looks at the school before they sign up.
b	A.35 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.35 utt2	I think that's a great idea,
sv	B.36 utt1	Some people don't do it,
sv	B.36 utt2	and then they get there and hate it, or whatever,
sd	B.36 utt3	so if it's possible.
b	A.37 utt1	Right.
sv	A.39 utt1	it seemed expensive at the time you're doing it, but the compared to the total decision it's nothing.
b	B.40 utt1	Right.
sv	B.42 utt1	I think in the short run it is expensive.
sv	B.42 utt2	In the long run it's very, reasonable if the person,
b	A.43 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.44 utt2	my daughter has been in Missouri for a second year,
sd	B.44 utt3	now she's coming home at the end of the semester
b	A.45 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.46 utt1	so, you know, she's already twenty one.
sd	B.46 utt2	She started late.
sd	B.46 utt3	So that's, you know, strictly up to her,
sd	B.46 utt4	and, she'll finish this year down here and then decide what she's going to do next year.
b	A.47 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.48 utt1	It'll save me a lot of money because I'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition
b	A.49 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.50 utt1	but again, that's her decision
b	A.51 utt1	Right.
sd	B.52 utt1	but I have so many students in my classes that have dropped out and come back,
sv	B.52 utt2	and they're much better students at twenty five, twenty six, may, twenty eight.
sd	B.52 utt3	So, you know, I never have pushed them.
sd	B.52 utt4	I just say that education is important, you should do it,
sd	B.52 utt5	but, they have to do the work
b	A.53 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.55 utt1	Yeah,
ad	A.55 utt2	well, back to this visiting thing,
sd	A.55 utt3	I mean, I found that my kids had no conception what college was really like and that the process of going around to a few schools with them really helped them understand
b	B.56 utt1	Right.
b	B.58 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.59 utt1	and being able to go with them to at least some of them gave me a chance to explain things to them in reference to what we had seen.
aa	B.60 utt1	I think so.
sv	B.62 utt1	And also I'm opposed to the size.
sv	B.62 utt2	They've just gotten so huge,
sd	B.62 utt3	and so my daughter first looked at a place that was forty thousand,
sv	B.62 utt4	see that's just too many.
ba	A.63 utt1	Good grief .
sd	B.64 utt1	Ended up going to where I used to go,
sd	B.64 utt2	and that was twenty five hundred when I went there,
sd	B.64 utt3	it's twenty one thousand, now
sv	B.64 utt4	it's too big.
ba	A.65 utt1	Good grief.
qw	A.67 utt1	What is twenty one thousand?
br	B.68 utt1	Pardon?
qw	A.69 utt1	What school is that?
sd	B.70 utt1	It's Southwest Missouri State University
b	A.71 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.72 utt1	and, it was twenty five hundred when I went there forty years ago,
sd	B.72 utt2	and, my son's in a school about seven thousand,
sv	B.72 utt3	and that's not bad
b	A.73 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.74 utt1	I teach in a school about eight thousand,
sv	B.74 utt2	and that's even a little large
aa	A.75 utt1	Yes.
sv	B.76 utt1	but it's much better than twenty one thousand.
sv	B.76 utt2	But they do have to visit, if the parent can point out all the different places to look for for scholarships,
b	A.77 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.78 utt2	and then, those rating,
sd	B.78 utt3	the magazines and all those things are doing the ratings now and everything,
sv	B.78 utt4	I don't think it hurts to look at them
aa	A.79 utt1	Yes.
sv	B.80 utt1	I don't put that much stock in them,
b	A.81 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.82 utt1	probably fine just to compare.
bf	A.83 utt1	Helps to at least set up range of things to look at.
b	B.84 utt1	Right.
sv	B.86 utt1	If you know, they need to,
