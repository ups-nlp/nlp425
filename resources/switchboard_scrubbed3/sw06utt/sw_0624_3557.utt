o	B.1 utt1	You think about AIDS research?
sv	A.2 utt1	Well, AIDS is a nasty, terrible disease,
sd	A.2 utt2	and you die from it.
sv	A.2 utt3	So I think that, they need to look into it
sv	A.2 utt4	and it's kind of like cancer.
h	A.2 utt5	I don't, you know,
qh	A.2 utt6	how many years have we tried to find a cure for cancer.
b	B.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.4 utt1	I think it'll probably be as difficult.
qo	A.4 utt2	how about yourself.
sd	B.5 utt1	well, I'm certainly in favor of AIDS research,
sv	B.5 utt2	and I think probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does.
sv	B.5 utt3	I think that
sd	B.5 utt4	because, besides the fact that it's a deadly disease, that it's a contagious disease, so that it's,
sv	B.5 utt5	although it is not killing that many people now, it still has the opportunity to get out of control and become a huge problem.
b	A.6 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.6 utt2	they say a million people are infected with the H I V virus,
b	B.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.8 utt3	I think,
qr^d	B.9 utt1	That's in the world, or in America?
sd	A.10 utt1	in the country, America.
bh	B.11 utt1	really?
ny	A.12 utt1	Yeah
sd	A.14 utt1	and they have millions.
qw	B.15 utt1	Whose figure is that?
sd	A.16 utt1	I don't know.
sd	A.16 utt2	I've just heard it on the radio.
bk	B.17 utt1	Okay.
sv	A.18 utt1	Sometimes you hear things on the radio that, you know, could be true or couldn't be.
b	B.19 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.20 utt1	do you feel like this is,
sv	A.20 utt2	I guess they're spending a billion or so a year on this AIDS research.
b	B.21 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.22 utt1	Do you think they should spend more?
ng	B.23 utt1	I think they should, actually, although perhaps not an incredible amount more than what they're doing,
sv	B.23 utt2	and I don't necessarily think that they should, fund AIDS research and, in the process, neglect cancer research or whatever.
sv	B.23 utt3	I think that it would be a good thing for the government to increase funding for medical research in general.
qw	A.24 utt1	What do you think, Doug, of Mister Johnson?
sd	B.25 utt1	 well, I am sorry that he has the virus.
qy^d	A.26 utt1	Magic?
h	B.27 utt2	I don't know,
sv	B.27 utt3	I think it's very strange that the media hasn't, questioned him more strongly about gay sex or intravenous drugs or anything like that, as they probably would for a lot of other people.
qy	A.28 utt1	Do you think he's the hero that he's being called by a bunch of the media?
ng	B.29 utt1	well, not really, though I mean, I think he's probably doing the right thing for a man in his position,
sv	B.29 utt2	but I don't think it's anything exceptional that he's doing.
sv	B.29 utt3	It's what many people have done already, who were just less famous.
sd	A.30 utt1	You know, I took advantage of the opportunity when, you know, he came out.
sd	A.30 utt2	I talked to my kids about it, you know
b	B.31 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.32 utt1	it's something that I hadn't done before.
b^r	B.33 utt1	Uh huh.
ba	B.35 utt1	Well, that's good.
sd	A.36 utt1	I'm glad that Mister Johnson's changed his tune on, safe sex to abstinence,
sv	A.36 utt2	or I was glad he did that, for young kids, because a lot of kids would have ended up dying because of what he was promoting.
b	B.37 utt1	Uh huh.
b^r	B.39 utt1	Uh huh.
^h	A.40 utt1	let's see.
qw	A.40 utt2	What are some of the other questions.
^h	A.40 utt4	let's see.
sd	A.40 utt5	I don't have any friends that have the disease.
qy^d	A.40 utt6	I guess you might not.
ny	B.41 utt1	yeah,
sd^e	B.41 utt2	I do.
sd	B.41 utt3	My cousin, does, for instance.
qy	A.42 utt1	Is it pretty nasty?
ny	B.45 utt1	Yeah,
ny^r	B.45 utt2	yeah
sd^e	B.45 utt3	it is.
sd	B.45 utt4	He's actually,
sd	B.45 utt5	he had AIDS related complex for a while,
sd	B.45 utt6	and he is now in full blown AIDS, really not doing very well, and has a brain tumor or that sort of thing.
b	A.46 utt1	Yeah,
ba	A.46 utt2	it sounds awful.
aa	B.47 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.47 utt2	it's a very nasty thing.
qy	A.48 utt1	Is it just that the immune system ceases to function properly
ny	B.49 utt1	yeah,
sd^e	B.49 utt2	that's basically it, that, the immune system can at first slow down,
sd	B.49 utt3	and the white blood cell count goes down,
sd	B.49 utt4	that's AIDS Related Complex,
sd	B.49 utt5	but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom, that's AIDS
sd	B.51 utt1	and in that case, you know, people are prone to getting any kind of, you know, weird cancer that only animals got before
b	A.52 utt1	really.
b	B.53 utt2	yeah,
sd	B.53 utt3	that sort of thing,
