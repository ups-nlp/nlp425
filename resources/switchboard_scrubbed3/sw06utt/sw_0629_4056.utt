o	A.1 utt1	Okay,
o*	A.1 utt2	should begin. / * listen; could probably code if we could tell if it said "we" or "you"
aa	B.2 utt1	Okay.
aa	B.2 utt2	All right.
sd	A.3 utt1	I can begin this,
sd	A.3 utt2	basically I work for Honeywell in Minneapolis
b	B.4 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.5 utt1	and the benefit program we have here is really quite good.
sd	A.5 utt2	I'm pretty pleased with it.
sd	A.5 utt3	They cover, just about everything, vision, dental, medical
b^r	B.6 utt1	Uh huh.
ad	A.7 utt1	you name it,
sd	A.7 utt2	and for me this is the first job I've had where they've covered that much,
sd	A.7 utt3	so I'm pretty satisfied myself.
b^r	B.8 utt1	Uh huh.
qw	A.9 utt1	what's your situation?
sd	B.10 utt1	I work for the University of New Hampshire,
sv	B.10 utt2	and our benefits package isn't quite as good in some ways. you know,
b	A.11 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.12 utt2	overall I'm satisfied with it.
sd	B.12 utt3	We don't have the vision care,
sd	B.12 utt4	we do have the health care and the or the dental.
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.15 utt1	Are you a professor there?
nn	B.16 utt1	No,
sd^e	B.16 utt2	I'm a, on the professional administrative and technical staff,
sd	B.16 utt3	and effectively I run the telephone switch at the University of New Hampshire.
bk	A.17 utt1	I see,
bk	A.17 utt2	okay.
sd	B.18 utt1	so the benefits,
sd	B.18 utt2	probably the main thing I like about the benefits is the, very generous vacation time and sick time.
aa	A.19 utt1	no doubt .
sd	B.20 utt1	We get fifteen days a year sick time,
sd	B.20 utt2	and, right from the day one when you start work, you get twenty four days a year, time off.
b	A.21 utt1	Right.
ba	A.21 utt2	Well, that's good.
b	B.22 utt1	Yeah.
b^m	A.23 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.23 utt2	that's one of the things I guess I would change about Honeywell, is,
sd	A.23 utt3	I used to work with the Army Research Institute,
sd	A.23 utt4	and being a government organization you got quite a few holidays off.
b	B.24 utt1	Right.
sd	A.25 utt1	But here you don't get that.
sd	A.25 utt2	You maybe get two or three a year.
b	B.26 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.27 utt2	unless you have some vacation time or some sick leave or whatever, you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time.
b	B.28 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.29 utt1	So, that's kind of a drawback I think.
h	A.29 utt2	But, I don't know.
qw	A.29 utt3	What do you consider most important, you think, in terms of the different benefits?
sv	B.30 utt1	Well, I think, the health care, of course, is an important, and has to be the single most important benefit
b	A.31 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.32 utt1	and, the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing, you know,
b	A.33 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.34 utt2	I'm a little disturbed about that,
sv	B.34 utt3	but I think that's a national trend,
sd	B.34 utt4	and I don't know what the solution is to it.
sv	B.34 utt5	It's bigger than just the benefits part.
b	A.35 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.35 utt2	I don't know if you saw on TWENTY TWENTY the other night,
sd	A.35 utt3	they basically reviewed Oregon's plan or The Oregon Plan toward, nationalizing health care and that kind of thing.
b	B.36 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.38 utt1	Right.
sv	A.39 utt2	It's kind of an interesting plan.
sv	A.39 utt3	It's kind of cold though.
sd	A.39 utt4	They've essentially made up a list of, all the different, medical maladies that you can have and then basically made a cutoff,
b	B.40 utt1	yeah.
sd	A.41 utt2	about six hundred and eighty seven and below will not be covered by, subsidized health care,
sd	A.41 utt3	and the ones above would.
sd	A.43 utt1	So it's kind of like drawing this line
sd	A.43 utt2	and if you have it great,
sd	A.43 utt3	if you don't, you're kind of out of luck
b	B.44 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.45 utt1	but, it was kind of an interesting show.
sd	A.47 utt1	I think you're right,
sv	A.47 utt2	I think health care is probably the most pressing the pressing one,
b	B.48 utt1	Right.
sd	A.49 utt2	but I'll tell you, I don't mind having dental, you know,
sv	A.49 utt3	sometimes dental costs can be, just about as expensive, if not more,
sd	A.49 utt4	and I know historically a lot of companies I think carried dental as a rider along with the medical
b	B.50 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.51 utt1	but I'm not sure that's widely followed any more.
sd	A.51 utt2	I'm not sure,
qw	A.51 utt3	how does, University of New Hampshire handle it?
sd	B.52 utt1	Well, we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental, depending,
sd	B.52 utt2	and the cost between them is very little.
sv	B.52 utt3	I think it costs me something like five dollars a month for the dental plan.
sd	B.54 utt1	But it pays, a substantial amount.
sd	B.54 utt2	I mean, the examinations and, checkups or every six months are free
ba	A.55 utt1	Great.
sd	B.56 utt1	and, it covers the bulk of the dental expenses.
qy	A.57 utt1	let me interrupt, is that the same for both, professors and also staff and administration,
qy	A.57 utt2	is that generally across the board, do you think
ny	B.58 utt1	yes,
sd^e	B.58 utt2	it is.
sd	B.58 utt3	The benefits plan is different for what we call operating staff, which are considered to be, clerical personnel, accountants, things like that as opposed to what they call the P A T staff, which I belong to
b	A.59 utt1	Right.
b	A.61 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.62 utt2	I think the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody, and the retirement plan.
sd	B.62 utt3	But the main difference is in the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued.
b^r	A.63 utt1	Uh huh.
bk	A.65 utt1	okay.
sd	B.66 utt1	for the operating staff it's it's, you know, based on how long they've worked there.
b	A.67 utt1	Right.
sd	B.68 utt1	That determines how much, vacation time they get.
b	A.69 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.69 utt2	I'm kind of interested because actually, that's the route I'd like to take when I finally get my degree is to teach in a university.
b	B.70 utt1	Uh huh.
b^r	B.72 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.73 utt1	I'm a doctoral student in Florida right now
b	B.74 utt1	Oh.
b	A.75 utt2	yeah,
sv	A.75 utt3	that's interesting.
sd	A.75 utt4	That's one of the things I'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would cover and things like that.
sd	B.76 utt1	College programs belong to this T I A A, C R E F retirement fund.
bh	A.77 utt1	is that right?
na	B.78 utt1	Right,
sd	B.78 utt2	and in the case of the University of New Hampshire,
