ad	A.1 utt1	go ahead,
ad	A.1 utt2	tell me what you think.
qy	A.1 utt3	Do we get our money's worth?
sd	B.2 utt1	Hey, listen, if I had my way, I wouldn't pay my taxes.
sv	B.2 utt2	not with some of the things that I hear that our tax money is going for some ludicrous things.
b	A.3 utt1	Yeah,
qy	A.3 utt2	did you see SIXTY MINUTES last night?
nn	B.4 utt1	No,
sd^e	B.4 utt2	I did not.
sd	A.5 utt1	Well, they did a thing on the thirty five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we don't need.
sv	A.5 utt2	And, it's staggering.
qo	B.6 utt1	Well, How did this grab you?
h	B.6 utt3	I mean, I'm a lady,
sd	B.6 utt4	but I heard this on a Christian program
sd	B.6 utt5	and it was, about the N E A
sd	B.6 utt6	and, that's the National Endowment for Arts,
sd	B.6 utt7	and they funded this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money.
sv	A.7 utt1	Well, there are a lot of things that people, I think general,
sd	B.8 utt1	And then it just frosts me terribly.
sv	A.9 utt1	Well, I think it's interesting to look at, where the money goes,
sv	A.9 utt2	and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go
sv	A.9 utt3	and and generally, I think what's interesting is that we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government
aa	B.10 utt1	Absolutely.
sv	A.11 utt2	and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with.
sv	B.12 utt1	I believe that's true,
aa	B.12 utt2	yes.
sv	A.13 utt1	And what I think is going to be really interesting is what we do about it.
sv	A.13 utt2	I mean, we are going to have to change the people who represent us.
aa	B.14 utt1	That's correct.
sv	A.15 utt1	I mean, and I think it's going to be real interesting to see and then force upon them,
^2	B.16 utt1	Heavy involvement from the public.
aa	A.17 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.17 utt2	right that's I think that's the only thing that's going to change it.
b	B.18 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.20 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.20 utt2	heavy involvement from the public.
sv	A.21 utt1	Our anger is going to have to give rise to more activity on our part.
b	B.22 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.23 utt2	I've said for years that there's full employment for the politically active
sv	A.23 utt3	and in our society, there's very little full employment.
sv	A.23 utt4	Most people in this country are getting worse off, not better off.
aa	B.24 utt1	Absolutely.
sd	A.25 utt1	Eighty percent of the public, according to Bill Moyers',
"	A.25 utt2	recent,
"	A.25 utt3	piece for,
sv	A.25 utt4	Public Broadcasting, which, by the way is a very good use of government money. I think P B S is wonderful.
sd	A.25 utt5	But this special focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are seeing their real incomes,
sd	A.25 utt6	and thus, standards of living, decline.
sd	A.25 utt7	And twenty percent are seeing theirs improve.
sv	A.25 utt8	That's not a formula for a better society.
aa	B.26 utt1	No,
sv	B.26 utt2	it is not.
sv	B.26 utt3	It's lopsided, very much
sv	A.27 utt1	And the government really plays a role in this.
b	B.28 utt1	Uh huh,
ba	B.28 utt2	that's right,
sv	B.28 utt3	they pull the strings.
ar	A.29 utt1	I mean, they are the people whose strings are pulled and by I guess powerful intere ,
b	B.30 utt1	Right,
sv	A.31 utt1	You know, and it's really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of the voter revolting.
sv	A.31 utt2	But people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others don't
sv	A.31 utt3	and they think it's unfair,
sv	A.31 utt4	and when they recognize that it's their tax money, they're going to do more about it.
sv	A.31 utt5	I'll tell you one thing very interesting.
sd	A.31 utt6	C B S, after the State of the Union address is going to open up a telephone line, an eight hundred number
sd	A.31 utt7	and people can call in and say what they think about what's going on in this country.
b	B.32 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.33 utt1	They expect, opening it for one hour, that they'll get three, hundred thousand telephone calls.
sv	B.38 utt1	I'm sure they will.
sv	A.39 utt1	And I've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to create an eight hundred number for voters to call and vent their frustration with government. Like one, eight hundred capitol or something like that. You know, just a number you could call from anywhere, anytime.
b	B.40 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.42 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.43 utt2	I think that's coming
sv	A.43 utt3	and I think once people really start to communicate how they feel, things are going to change.
sv	A.43 utt4	Until then, I think, you know, it's going to be really painful.
qh	A.43 utt5	So the question is, how soon are we going to start to get our money's worth
sv	A.43 utt6	and, as you said, it's how soon we get involved,
sv(^q)	A.43 utt7	and I think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved, like allowing us to call a toll free number and say, hey, look, do it this way, not that way, or I like this, or I don't like that, or this is how I feel about your spending my money on art that I don't think is art.
b	B.44 utt1	Yes,
sd	B.44 utt2	I understand that,
sd	B.44 utt3	but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it.
sv	A.45 utt1	Well, that's the good thing about what is happening because I think more and more the news media, which takes a heck of a beating and deserves some of it, is telling us, you know, about the problems.
sv	A.45 utt2	So the more we communicate, hey, look, we want a change here, because, you know, as it turns out, we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country.
aa	B.46 utt1	absolutely.
sd	A.47 utt1	Over a very long period of time.
aa	B.48 utt1	Right,
aa	B.48 utt2	absolutely.
sv	B.50 utt1	We only see the tip of the iceberg only.
b	A.51 utt1	Right.
sv	B.52 utt1	You know, there's so much of it going on that it would really, you know, set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture.
b	A.53 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.55 utt1	Well, you may be right.
sv	A.55 utt2	What I think is really going to be interesting is to see how, we as a society deal with it
sv	A.55 utt3	and I think what you say, it's, it's a,
