fp	A.1 utt1	Hi Ed.
fp	B.2 utt1	Hi.
fp	A.3 utt1	Hi.
sd	B.4 utt1	books,
sd	B.4 utt2	actually I am reading a couple of different books,
sd	B.4 utt3	one is, a story,
sd	B.4 utt4	well it is not a story,
sd	B.4 utt5	it is a collection of memos, supposedly written by Howard Hughes,
sd	B.6 utt2	it came out a couple of years ago
sd	B.6 utt3	and I have just now gotten around to reading it.
sd	B.6 utt4	I have had it a couple years,
qw	A.7 utt1	Who wrote that?
sd	B.8 utt1	I do not remember the man's name,
sd	B.8 utt2	he used to be a reporter for, I think, the NEW YORK TIMES, or the WASHINGTON POST, one of the two,
sd	B.8 utt3	and he supposedly this, story, I mean this, was contacted by this guy who had these memos he wanted to sell,
sd	B.8 utt4	and they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the, corporate headquarters in Los Angeles.
sd	B.10 utt2	I think it was Romain Drive or Romain Street or something, there in Los Angeles,
sd	B.10 utt3	they used to have a,
sv	B.10 utt4	or, I guess they still do,
sd	B.10 utt5	had a, big warehouse kind of thing, which had offices
sd	B.10 utt6	and it was sort of nondescript you know, for the size of the company which, inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected,
sd	B.10 utt7	he was, a great collector of everything,
sd	B.10 utt8	he, he did not, he did not throw anything away
sd	B.10 utt9	and, supposedly this guy had been breaking there for awhi ,
sd	B.10 utt10	he was a, like, you know, burglar, had been breaking there awhile and, And had ended up,
b	A.11 utt1	I see.
sd	B.12 utt2	he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect,
sd	B.12 utt3	and they broke in one night and found a bunch of memos that were, supposedly from Hughes to his main assistant back, in the fifties and I guess, in the sixties, up until his death.
ba	A.13 utt1	Well, that is interesting.
b	A.15 utt1	Right.
sv	B.16 utt1	So, it's pretty interesting work
sv	A.17 utt1	That is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that.
b	B.18 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.18 utt2	it's a little, it's a little hard
sv	B.18 utt3	you have to plod through it
sd	B.18 utt4	and, you know, it does not have a real story, or any plot,
b	A.19 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.20 utt1	you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on.
sd	A.21 utt1	And, they have not made a movie of the week of it yet.
aa	B.22 utt1	No,
sd	B.22 utt2	I have not seen it.
sv	B.24 utt1	but it is, it is real interesting,
b	A.25 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.26 utt1	I also reading, thi ,
sd	B.26 utt2	it's an old, another old book that I happen to have.
sd	B.26 utt3	I am sort of rereading it.
sd	B.26 utt4	It's, a book about, the Bermuda Triangle,
sd	B.26 utt5	but it's about, it's a real good book that a guy, wrote who was, a research librarian,
sd	B.26 utt6	he wrote, sort of debunking many of the stories about the, Bermuda Triangle. You know,
sd	B.26 utt7	he was thinking many, many of the myths, many of the myths of the triangle actually, could be explained,
sd^m*	A.29 utt1	Explained , /* listen; could be br
sd	B.30 utt1	you know. and the reason I picked it back up was in light of Well when they found the, the airplanes in the Atlantic, thinking they were Flight Nineteen.
sd	B.30 utt2	And I don't know if you are familiar with that at all
sd	B.30 utt4	Flight Nineteen was a, a collection of a flight of five Navy adventures at the end of World War Two. Right after World War Two,
sd	B.30 utt5	and they were lost
qy^d	A.31 utt1	Supposedly scooped up by the triangle.
ny	B.32 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.32 utt2	they were.
b	A.33 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.34 utt1	and in the book, you know, even,
sd	B.34 utt2	he wrote this book back in the seventies,
sd	B.34 utt3	and even then he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water.
sd	B.34 utt4	because he mentions, he goes through and brings out points from the Navy's findings and so forth.
sv	B.34 utt5	And, it's probably, you know, real close to what, you know, everyone is thinking, now that, they just got turned around and could not find their way back.
b	A.35 utt1	Yeah.
qy	A.35 utt2	On that same topic, have you ever read anything about, you know, the Amelia Earhart story, whatever happened with her?
nn	B.36 utt1	no,
sd^e	B.36 utt2	I have not.
sv	A.37 utt1	I think that would be,
sv	A.37 utt2	I am sure there is something out there, ,
b	B.38 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.38 utt2	I would like to, too,
sd	B.38 utt3	because it's a lot of things coming up here lately about her, you know, possibilities of where she ,
sd	A.39 utt1	I thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years.
sd	A.41 utt1	Well whatever, this is one aspect of it.
b	B.42 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.43 utt1	Of course, you know, it is so weird,
sv	A.43 utt2	cause no one will ever really know,
sv	A.43 utt4	but it's entertaining
sv	A.43 utt5	and it makes you think about things.
b	B.44 utt1	Right.
sv	A.45 utt1	That is for sure.
b	B.46 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.46 utt2	So, that is pretty much for right now,
sd	B.46 utt3	that is, what I have been reading.
b	A.47 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.48 utt2	I kind of like to read different stuff
sd	B.48 utt3	and, I like to read a novel every now and then,
sd	B.48 utt4	but, I am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time.
b	A.49 utt1	Right.
sd	A.49 utt2	Well, I guess I just have not read anyth ,
sd	A.49 utt3	I mean, usually, if I find a good book, I will sit, you know, for two days until it is finished. If it's that good,
b	B.50 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.51 utt1	and I think the last one I read like that was Scott Thurow's
sd	A.51 utt2	and that was PRESUMED INNOCENT.
b	B.52 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.53 utt1	And I just really, really liked the way he writes.
sv	A.53 utt2	It's just, incredible.
b	B.54 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.54 utt2	I read that, too.
sd	B.54 utt3	I got it, right, after it came out.
b	A.57 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.58 utt1	he was an assistant district attorney in Chicago and while he was writing the book,
sd	B.58 utt2	and, my sister in law lives in Chicago,
sd(^q)	B.58 utt3	and before it actually got big, she sent me this book saying, you might like this,
^q	B.58 utt4	this guy is, you know, from here.
sd	B.60 utt2	And, I read it and really liked it
sd	B.60 utt4	that is when it really got big.
sv	A.61 utt1	That was good, I think.
sd	A.63 utt1	and the other book I am trying to think, you know, like was in the last year
sd	A.63 utt2	and I think I did read Tom Wolfe and VANITY,
^2	B.64 utt1	(BONFIRE OF THE VANITY ,
aa	A.65 utt2	yeah.
sd	B.66 utt1	I have not read that, although, I have heard it is pretty good.
b	A.69 utt1	Yeah
sv	A.69 utt3	that was really, really good,
sv	A.69 utt4	the movie was nothing compared to the book.
aa	B.70 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.70 utt2	that is what I have heard.
b	A.71 utt2	Yeah.
sd	B.72 utt1	I saw the movie,
sv	A.73 utt1	the movie was a joke compared to,
sv	A.73 utt2	I mean, because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive, when it comes to, you know, pinpointing, so , society's ills and, things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things
b	B.74 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.76 utt1	Right.
sv	A.77 utt2	and, and so, it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie .
b	B.78 utt1	Right.
b	B.80 utt1	I know.
sd	A.81 utt1	And, anyway, we are not talking about that,
sd	A.81 utt2	but, gee, I like to read gardening books and things like that. Just to tell me what to do with my garden
b	B.82 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.84 utt1	I have a lot of, computer books that
sd	B.84 utt2	I do computer work
sd	B.84 utt3	and so I have a lot of those.
sd	B.84 utt4	So, I spend a lot of time looking through those, not necessarily reading them but, looking through them.
b	A.85 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.86 utt2	But I'm interested in a lot of that,
sd	B.86 utt3	but, I have got a lot of books that I intend to read,
sd	B.86 utt4	but I have not been able to yet, you know, for one reason or another.
qw	A.87 utt1	Like, what is a book on your list,
sd	A.87 utt2	you know I have a list too
sd	A.87 utt3	and I have never gotten to it .
sd	B.88 utt1	gosh, I do not really have a list,
sd	B.88 utt2	cause I just have all the books out, you know,
sd	B.88 utt3	I have book shelves
sd	B.88 utt4	and I have them all out
sd	B.88 utt5	and usually when I am through with one, I will go in and, look through,
sd	B.88 utt6	I have one now and I can not remember the name of it that I got is
sd	B.88 utt7	the sister in law in Chicago usually sends me for my birthday or Christmas or something will send me another good book
b	A.89 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.90 utt2	I have one
sd	B.90 utt3	and I can not remember the name of it,
sd	B.90 utt4	it is supposed to be a mystery.
