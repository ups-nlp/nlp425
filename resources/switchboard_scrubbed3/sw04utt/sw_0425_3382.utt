sd	A.1 utt1	I guess, I've always been kind of interested in, space and stuff.
sd	A.1 utt2	I've, read a lot of the, the, astronomy books and, and stuff like that.
b	B.2 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.4 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.6 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.8 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	B.8 utt2	Have you been following the progress of the space health code ?
na	A.9 utt1	to a degree.
sd	A.9 utt2	I haven't kept up as, much as I would like,
b	B.10 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.11 utt1	I've just been so busy,
b	B.12 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.13 utt1	I barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then,
b	B.14 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.14 utt2	I think it's pretty exciting that they can,
sv	B.14 utt3	it would be interesting to see if they can find, other planets that will be more habitable to, you know, humans
sd	B.14 utt5	I think I would be very interested in space travel in the future if it, you know, if it is at all possible.
b	A.15 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.15 utt2	Well, I wouldn't even mind, being a pilot on one,
sv	A.17 utt2	but I'm probably getting a little too old for that.
sv	B.18 utt1	Well, I know if they make the advances that they have been making, that, maybe age or even physical, abilities may not be, a barrier anymore.
aa	A.19 utt1	Right.
aa	A.19 utt2	Yeah.
sv	A.19 utt3	Well, they just made leaps and jumps.
sv	A.19 utt4	I think a lot of our technology we have is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel, equipment and stuff that,
aa	B.20 utt1	Yeah,
aa	B.20 utt2	I agree.
sd	B.20 utt3	as a matter of fact we're the ones that I have been to Houston to, you know, to visit the, space center out there,
sd	B.20 utt4	and, one of the big advances that we use every day now is Velcro
b	A.21 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.22 utt1	and, that vacuum , little space program was one of the big, you know, backers of that.
b	A.23 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.24 utt1	It's amazing, you know,
sv	B.24 utt3	it's hard to imagine what life was like without it now.
b	A.25 utt1	Yeah.
qy^d	A.27 utt1	I don't know if you ever watch Gallagher , you know,
sd	A.27 utt2	he's one of the comedians
sd	A.27 utt3	and and, you know, he talks a lot on Velcro.
ny	B.28 utt1	Uh huh,
ny	B.28 utt2	yeah,
sd^e	B.28 utt3	I've seen him before.
qh	A.31 utt1	i , what would we do without it? .
b	B.32 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.32 utt2	we were talking about that just the other day.
qh	B.32 utt3	What did we do without it back then?
b	A.33 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.34 utt1	I guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps.
b	A.35 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.37 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.37 utt2	there's a lot of little things that have come up .
sd	A.37 utt4	concentrated foods for one maybe
h	A.37 utt5	I don , I don't know
aa	B.38 utt1	That's right.
aa^r	B.38 utt2	That's right.
qh	A.39 utt2	it's also just I've often pictured, in my mind, you know, what would you find if you just kept on going?
aa	B.40 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	B.40 utt2	That's true.
sv	A.41 utt1	I guess our minds are so, what is it? finite
b	B.42 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.43 utt1	when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object, and it's hard to see, you know.
b	B.44 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.46 utt1	Yeah.
sd(^q)	A.47 utt1	I always thought well, what do you do hit a brick wall, eventually.
sv	A.49 utt1	It's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely.
aa	B.50 utt1	Yeah,
aa	B.50 utt2	that is, that is something that would be hard to think about.
aa	B.50 utt3	I agree.
aa	B.50 utt4	You know like you say we're used to finite things
sv	B.50 utt5	and something that is infinite and just incomprehensible.
aa	A.51 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.52 utt1	But, yeah,
sd	B.52 utt2	I would like to see them, do more in that area to make space travel more, something that the ordinary person can, enjoy.
aa	A.53 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.53 utt2	I think it's in people's nature to be the first to do something.
b	B.54 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.55 utt1	And I'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like, you know,
b	B.56 utt1	Yeah.
b^r	B.56 utt2	Yeah,
sd	B.56 utt3	me too.
sd	B.56 utt4	I wouldn't even mind being not so much being first but just, get out there and just explore.
b	A.57 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.58 utt1	I think, it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they haven't, or experience something, you know, indifferent.
sv	A.61 utt1	I think that's what made us, progress to the state we are is our curiosity.
aa	B.62 utt1	sure.
aa^r	B.62 utt2	Sure.
aa	B.62 utt3	Of course.
aa	B.62 utt4	That's true.
sv	A.63 utt1	There must be some better way of doing this.
sv	A.63 utt2	A better place to be or whatever, you know
b	B.64 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.65 utt1	So you are always looking for something better.
aa	B.66 utt1	Yeah,
aa	B.66 utt2	that's true.
sd	A.67 utt1	I know at work, people always complain to me
sd	A.67 utt2	well, you are always whining
sd	A.67 utt3	and, it's, I'm always looking for something better.
b	B.70 utt1	Yeah .
sv	A.71 utt1	There's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it.
aa	B.72 utt1	That's right.
aa^r	B.72 utt2	That's right.
sv	B.72 utt3	And if you are just content with being, you know, with the way things are then, you know, then you must lead a pretty dull life.
b	A.73 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.75 utt1	Well, they are always finding easier ways
sv	A.75 utt2	and, you know, just because they don't talk about it or something like that.
b	B.76 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.77 utt1	And they are doing it you know, unconsciously.
aa	B.78 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.78 utt2	I guess, you don't really think about it too much.
sv	B.78 utt3	I guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff
sv	B.78 utt5	it's a subconscious, you know, thing.
sv	B.78 utt6	You know, somewhere they can sit down and write down what, you know, things that you've improved upon,
sv	B.78 utt7	you probably wouldn't have a pretty good list.
b	A.79 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.80 utt1	But you just don't think about them.
b	A.81 utt1	Right.
aa	B.82 utt1	And that's true.
sd	B.82 utt3	we've gotten different programs at work, you know, to, make it visible to management that we are doing things better,
