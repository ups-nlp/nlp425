o	A.1 utt1	Okay.
sd	A.1 utt2	well, since I initiated the call, I guess I'll start off first.
sd	A.1 utt3	number one, I have absolutely no problem with random testing.
sd	A.1 utt4	I spend an awful lot of time traveling on the job
sd	A.1 utt5	and I feel, I would be very comfortable if they would do drug testing for, particularly airline pilots and such.
sd	A.1 utt6	I'd feel much more comfortable than I do now, based on what I've been hearing in the newspapers.
sd	A.1 utt7	So I really don't have a problem with it.
b	B.2 utt1	Yeah. {F Uh,
sd	B.2 utt2	} I don't either.
sd	B.2 utt4	I don't work, at home right now.
sd	B.2 utt5	I stay home with my children.
sd	B.2 utt6	but my husband works
sd	B.2 utt7	and they do have that at his place of employment
sd	B.2 utt8	and neither of us have a problem with it.
sd	B.2 utt9	We've, particularly, like you said with the things that the airlines and such.
sv	B.2 utt10	it's a scary thing to know that, you just don't know what people are doing before they go to work.
b	A.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.4 utt2	So, and the advertisements on television lately have been so,
sv	B.4 utt3	there have been so many. You know,
b	A.5 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.6 utt2	like tr , train wrecks and things like that
sd	B.6 utt4	probably just for our own safety when we're traveling and things that would be something I'd like to know that's going on.
aa	A.7 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.7 utt3	my job is I'm supervisor of personnel safety for the world's largest paint company,
sd	A.7 utt5	it's very near and dear to me when we start talking about drug testing for random sampling and testing for cause, this type of thing.
sd	A.7 utt6	And even in our field we have people that are in very high risk jobs
sd	A.7 utt7	and we, at the present time, do not have random testing.
sd	A.9 utt1	And I am pushing towards that.
sv	A.9 utt2	I honestly feel if people have nothing to hide, they shouldn't have a problem with it.
b	B.10 utt1	Right.
sd	A.11 utt1	And if they are trying to hide something, then I have to know that, because we're talking major liabilities.
sd	A.11 utt2	Not only with themselves, but with other employees.
b	B.12 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.13 utt2	they're talking about sports and sports personalities and all this stuff that I would much prefer having doctors and airline pilots tested on a random basis.
b	B.14 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.15 utt2	I have a real fear,
sv	A.15 utt3	but that at some point something's going to happen.
sv	A.15 utt4	And they're showing it with AIDS,
sv	A.15 utt6	they ought to start doing something with the drugs .
sd	A.15 utt7	So I really have no problem with it.
aa	B.16 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.16 utt2	Well, it's unfortunate, I think, that everyone doesn't have that opinion.
sd	B.16 utt3	I've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it's an invasion of privacy and things like that,
sv	B.16 utt4	but, in the long run, it seems to me, it's kind of like what they keep talking about the AIDS testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that, you know,
b	A.17 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.18 utt2	they feel that's not fair and whatever,
sv	B.18 utt3	but, you know, those kind of things I'd like to know myself.
aa	A.19 utt1	Yes.
sd	B.20 utt4	I've had a lot of dental work done,
sd	B.20 utt5	and the last dentist didn't even use gloves at all,
bh	A.21 utt1	really?
ny	B.22 utt2	yeah.
sd^e	B.22 utt3	so that kind of thing really kind of concerns me.
sd	A.23 utt1	Well, that scares me because if that's the way they are,
sd	A.23 utt3	if I were a dentist, I'd want to be protected, too.
sv	B.24 utt1	Well, you would think so.
b	A.25 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.26 utt2	and I worked for a dentist
sd	B.26 utt4	you come in contact with a lot of blood and things like that
sv	B.26 utt5	and it's real, real dangerous.
b	A.27 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.28 utt1	I would think,
sd	B.28 utt4	airlines just drive me crazy.
sv	B.28 utt5	People are afraid to fly now. You know, just because they don't know what their pilot's been doing and things like that
b	A.29 utt1	Right.
b	A.31 utt1	Uh huh.
h	B.32 utt1	I don't know.
sd	A.33 utt1	Well, where you're located, I do know Texas Instruments has random drug testing.
b	B.34 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.35 utt1	And I think they've had it for several years.
sd	A.35 utt2	And they're program they had, I don't think had a lot of, problems associated with it,
sd	A.35 utt3	but, my brother in law happens to work there
sd	A.35 utt4	and it sounded very positive.
sv	A.35 utt5	And I think it's great.
sd	A.35 utt6	I would like, I would encourage it.
sd	A.35 utt7	I'm pushing our company towards that. .
sv	B.36 utt1	Well, and, you know, if they do find someone who is, having a problem with drugs
sv	B.36 utt2	and they can get them the help that they need. As opposed to just letting the problem go on without any, support. And whatever,
aa	A.37 utt1	Right.
aa	A.39 utt1	Exactly.
sv	B.40 utt2	because a lot of people, seems like, obviously are trying to hide that from their employer and friends and family and things
b	A.41 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.42 utt2	and too many people are just dying. Particularly in our area.
b	A.43 utt1	Right.
qw^d	B.44 utt2	I don't know what the crime is like where you are,
sd	B.44 utt3	but the crime rate here is just astronomical.
sd	A.45 utt1	Ours is changing.
sd^r	A.45 utt3	ours is changing,
sd	A.45 utt4	it's increasing.
sd	A.45 utt5	I live in a very nice suburb
sv	A.45 utt6	and it's, it's unbelievable what, what's going on and the selling of drugs.
sv	A.45 utt7	it's just too loose.
sv	A.45 utt8	It's too free.
aa	B.46 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.46 utt2	I just got a piece of paper the other day, that now they have these,
sd	B.46 utt3	I have two very little children, under two
b	A.47 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.48 utt1	and I got a piece of paper from my husband's office,
sd	B.48 utt2	it's talking about these, drug tattoos now that they have got.
bh	A.49 utt1	Really?
sd	B.50 utt2	it looks like a sticker
sd	B.50 utt3	and it's for kid,
