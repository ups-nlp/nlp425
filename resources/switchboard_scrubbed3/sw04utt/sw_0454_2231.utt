o	A.1 utt1	Okay.
sd^t	A.1 utt2	Capital punishment,
sv	A.1 utt3	I honestly don't feel like it's strict enough in my opinion.
qr	B.2 utt1	In the way that it's applied or it's applied at all?
b	A.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.5 utt1	Applied at all.
qw	B.6 utt2	how do you feel that it should be applied?
sv	A.7 utt1	Well, I just feel like there's a lot of murderers and rapists, and everything else, just walking the streets. You know?
qy	B.8 utt1	And that, the penalty ought to be out there, and be enforced?
ny	A.9 utt1	Yes.
ny^r	A.9 utt2	Yes.
sv	A.9 utt3	Not getting paroled, lets say in so many, years.
b	B.10 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.11 utt2	I mean, if your going to sentence somebody, lets say twenty years, let them stay twenty years.
aa	B.12 utt2	I agree with that completely.
sd	B.12 utt3	I know we don't have enough prisons,
sv	B.12 utt4	but there has got to be some kind of punishment, For these people.
aa	A.13 utt1	There has,
aa	A.15 utt1	that's right.
sv	B.16 utt1	Because if they turn around, they get away with it,
sv	B.16 utt2	and they get away with it,
sv^r	B.16 utt3	and they get away with it,
sv	B.16 utt4	and then they do something worse
b	A.17 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.18 utt1	and they get a slap on the wrist.
sv	B.18 utt2	They get, thirty days in jail
b	A.19 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.21 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.22 utt1	and they final get up to where they kill somebody else,
sv	B.22 utt2	and they go through fourteen appeals, and how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars.
b	A.23 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	A.25 utt1	That's right.
aa	A.25 utt2	That's, honestly right.
sv@	A.27 utt2	They have really got it better than we do, in a lot of ways . You know? / * two utts? you know as sep?
sv	B.28 utt1	Well, they certainly are living off our ex , at our expense.
aa	A.29 utt1	they sure are just because, some innocent person, can really,
sv	A.33 utt2	it seems like, really a rough time
b	B.34 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.35 utt1	you know? I'm not saying innocent person,
sd	A.35 utt2	let's say someone wrote a hot check, for instance.
sv	A.35 utt3	You know, when they go to prison, it, they really seem like it's a rough time for them
b	B.36 utt1	Uh huh.
sd@	A.37 utt1	and a murderer well go to prison, / * sp: will
sv	A.37 utt2	he's just there to serve his time, and get back out on the street.
bf	B.38 utt1	and be paroled, and and have served the sentence,
b	A.39 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.40 utt2	that's what people face with that choice.
sv	B.40 utt3	One thing I really hate, is they don't explain to the jurors, in a trial, in a capital murder trial, or in cases of rape, or in different things that are so horrible, what it means when they sentence them to, you know,
sd	B.40 utt4	they'll sentence them to ninety years and say you know, that it's going to, you know,
b	A.41 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.42 utt2	that should be life,
sd	B.42 utt4	given the choice of either sentencing to death, or sentencing to life, they'll give them ninety years in prison or something, and then turn around in thirty years, that, you know,
sv	B.42 utt5	and less they're out.
b	A.43 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.44 utt1	if they're even in that long.
sd	B.44 utt2	Or they appeal,
sd	B.44 utt3	and then they get an appeal that says it was, you know, an unjust amount of time, an extraordinary long length, or something.
b^m	A.45 utt1	Time, uh huh.
b	A.47 utt1	Yes.
sv	A.47 utt3	I would love to see them just really get real strict on parole you know.
b	B.48 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.50 utt1	I'd like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent,
sv	B.50 utt2	I think people know that it doesn't, you know,
sv	B.50 utt3	it's not a deterrent right now, because it's not really effective.
b	A.51 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.52 utt1	There's should be, you know, for this crime, this is the penalty.
sv	B.52 utt2	You killed, someone you know, in cold blood or whatever.
b	A.53 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	A.55 utt1	Yeah.
^2	A.55 utt2	You get, it back,
aa	A.57 utt2	yeah.
sd	B.58 utt2	This is what's going to happen.
b	A.59 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.60 utt1	And, I mean, it sounds horrible.
sd	B.60 utt3	I hear myself saying this,
sv	B.60 utt4	but, I, don't know what else to do with some of these people, that are,
b	A.61 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.63 utt1	I know.
sd	B.64 utt2	because they let them back out again,
sv	B.64 utt3	and they do the same thing over, and over, again,
b^m	A.65 utt1	Same thing,
b	A.67 utt1	Yes.
sd	B.68 utt2	then they put them back in jail,
sd	B.68 utt3	and they get out,
sd	B.68 utt4	and and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed
b	A.69 utt1	Yes.
b	A.71 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.72 utt1	and these guys just are on the endless merry go round in the legal system.
b	A.73 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.74 utt1	And it's like I said at our expense.
sv	A.75 utt1	a lot of people really doesn't think that much about it, because it hasn't happened to them, which it hasn't to me either, you know?
b	B.76 utt1	Yes.
fe	A.77 utt1	Thank goodness.
sd	A.77 utt2	But still, it could.
aa	B.78 utt1	I know,
sd	B.78 utt2	you read about it in the paper, every day, somebody who's done this, or that, something really horrible
b	A.79 utt1	Yes.
b	A.81 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.82 utt1	and they just get away with it,
sv	B.82 utt2	and nothing happens.
sd	A.83 utt1	And as far as the other states, I honestly don't know what their capital punishment is.
sd	A.83 utt2	You know, I, haven't kept up, you know, anything, like that.
b	B.84 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.86 utt1	I think I think Texas, the southern states seem to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty,
sd	B.88 utt2	and I know California had it for a long time,
sd	B.88 utt3	and then they, took it off the books,
sd	B.88 utt4	they repealed it
b	A.89 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.90 utt1	and people like Charles Manson, and some of these other people, who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty, were sentenced to life in prison, and are now that even though California has reinstated the death penalty, for whatever various crimes.
sd	B.92 utt2	The people who were there originally, when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty, are in prison, in quote, for life, and are now coming up for parole,
sd	B.92 utt3	some of them, like Manson who's come up you know
b	A.95 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.96 utt2	it's been denied fortunately
b	A.97 utt1	Yes.
qy^g	A.97 utt2	But still, it came up though, didn't it,
ny	B.98 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.100 utt1	Well, the jury that sentenced him, sentenced him to death
b	A.101 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.102 utt1	and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal, the state of California revoked the law in the early seventies,
sd	B.102 utt2	and then they reinstated it later,
sd	B.102 utt3	but the penalty didn't go back. You know?
b	A.103 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.104 utt1	It seems like a lot of times the law is totally on the criminal side, and isn't protecting the rest of the people.
b	A.105 utt1	Yes.
sv	A.105 utt2	The victim is really, seems like left out in the cold, more or less, doesn't it,
b	B.106 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.107 utt1	well, especially in things, you pick up the paper,
sd(^q)	A.107 utt2	and you read, you know, you think, oh my goodness
b	B.108 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.110 utt2	Some of the things that would make sense to tell the jury, that this guy has a prior criminal history, you know, where he's raped ten women
b	A.111 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.112 utt1	and then he gets up for this one trial,
sd	B.112 utt2	and they don't finds anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again
b	A.113 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.114 utt2	I don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever,
sd	B.114 utt3	but they give him a lighter sentence, thinking he's not a habitual criminal.
bf	A.115 utt1	Or, you know, plead insanity.
aa	B.116 utt1	Yeah,
o@	A.117 utt1	You know . * slash error And a lots of things. / * slash error
b	B.118 utt1	yeah. Well,
sv	B.120 utt2	But that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too.
b	A.121 utt1	yes,
sd	B.122 utt1	They plead insanity
b	A.123 utt1	uh huh.
b^r	A.123 utt2	Uh huh.
sd	B.124 utt1	and then three years later they're cured, and let loose on society again.
b	A.125 utt1	Yes.
sv	A.125 utt3	it just, just doesn't make sense,
sv	B.126 utt1	I mean, it's a it's a scary world out there anymore, where your afraid to go out,
sd	B.128 utt2	I know, in the Dallas metroplex area, I don't go out hardly if I don't have to at night by myself
b	A.129 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.130 utt1	and I certainly, I, I grew up in a smaller town in Texas,
sd	B.130 utt2	and it wasn't that way when I was younger.
b	A.131 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.131 utt2	Well, like I, said, I live in a small place. You know.
sd	B.132 utt1	We could go around,
sd	A.133 utt2	But, even the small towns now though, has really changed from when I was a kid,
sd	A.133 utt3	but now I'm raising children.
b	B.134 utt1	Yes.
sd	B.134 utt4	when I was a kid, I would run between my neighbors, three and four blocks sometimes, as long as my mom had a general idea where I was and I was back on the time,
b	A.135 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.136 utt2	and now I don't let my kids out of the front yard, that I can't see them.
aa^m	A.137 utt1	See them.
aa	A.137 utt2	Yeah.
aa^r	A.137 utt3	Yeah.
sv^t	A.137 utt5	Well, we're probably fixing to run out of time pretty, soon,
b	B.138 utt1	Uh huh.
fc	A.139 utt2	but I've enjoyed talking to you.
fc	B.140 utt1	Well, good talking to you too.
fc	B.140 utt2	Bye,
fc	A.141 utt1	Bye
fc	B.142 utt1	bye.
