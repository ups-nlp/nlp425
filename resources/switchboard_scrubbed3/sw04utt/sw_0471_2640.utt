qw^d	A.1 utt1	Well, I mean, I don't know what you think about the, subject,
sd	A.1 utt2	the, I had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the sentencing to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that.
sd	A.1 utt3	I've been kind of sitting here thinking about that a little bit while I was waiting for them to phone somebody,
sd	A.1 utt4	and I don't know that that's not a good idea.
sv	B.2 utt1	That's not a bad idea
sv	B.2 utt4	they probably, need to change it somehow,
sv	B.2 utt5	the whole system needs changing,
sv	B.2 utt6	we've just got too many people in there , and, , are putting too many, people in jail that probably don't need to be there
aa	A.3 utt1	I agree.
sv	B.4 utt2	and it's another form of sentencing.
b	A.5 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.6 utt1	But on that one thing, I still think it should be a unanimous decision,
aa	A.7 utt1	yeah,
aa	A.7 utt2	I agree.
aa^r	A.7 utt3	Yeah.
sv	B.8 utt1	I think we're getting to the point now where they're going to eventually let it be, majority vote.
sv	B.8 utt2	And that's not going to be good.
sd	A.9 utt1	I don't like that,
aa	A.9 utt2	no,
b^m	B.10 utt1	No.
sd	A.11 utt1	I don't like that at all.
sd	A.11 utt2	I know my husband served on a jury a few months ago up here in Denton,
sd	A.11 utt3	but, it was, it was a drug conviction
sd	A.11 utt5	he had some cocaine and was accused of selling it,
sd	A.11 utt6	and I don't remember exactly how much he had
sd	A.11 utt7	but, actually not selling it ,
sd	A.11 utt8	there's a difference,
sd	A.11 utt9	cro , couriering it is what,
sd	A.11 utt10	ther , is supposedly a difference from selling then being a courier
sd	A.11 utt11	and, he was a courier.
b	B.12 utt1	Right.
sd	A.13 utt2	And, he's, he sat on that jury
sd	A.13 utt3	and they found him guilty,
sd	A.13 utt4	and they went through the sentencing phase and everything
sd	A.13 utt5	and, you know, they were told that, you know, during the trial that this is this guy's first offense
sd	A.13 utt6	and he's got this clean record,
sd	A.13 utt7	and they ended up,
sd(^q)	A.13 utt8	the jury, you know, decided, it's time to crackdown here, you know,
sd	A.13 utt9	and it was time to do this drug thing
^q	A.13 utt10	and let's crackdown
^q	A.13 utt11	and let's really,
sd	A.13 utt12	and they sentenced him to fifteen years, you know, which they thought that that was a good thing.
b	B.14 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.15 utt2	And they sentencing him to fifteen years
sd	A.15 utt3	and, after it was all over, they , let me come over in just a second, okay, and sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers
sd	A.15 utt4	and they were told that, he would probably serve three, of the fifteen, and that he had three previous convictions.
b	B.16 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.18 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.19 utt2	However, they could not tell the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal.
b	B.20 utt1	yeah.
sd	A.21 utt1	So, the jury didn't know about it,
sd	A.21 utt2	so here they based their sentencing thinking that this was this guy's first offense,
b	B.22 utt1	Sure .
sd(^q)	A.23 utt1	so, you know, we'll give him fifteen which will teach him a lesson
sv	A.23 utt2	but it's just, you know, horrible, since it was first offense
b	B.24 utt1	Yeah .
sd	A.25 utt2	and he'd been convicted three times before, you know,
b	B.26 utt1	Oh .
sd	A.27 utt1	and the jury was very upset
sd	A.27 utt2	and my husband came home, very upset,
sd	A.27 utt3	I mean, he felt that they had been tricked, you know,
b	B.28 utt1	Right.
qh	A.29 utt2	I wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change, you know.
aa	B.30 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.30 utt2	the judge might know
sv	B.30 utt3	or at least it wouldn't hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better,
sv	B.30 utt4	if it didn't we can come back for something else
aa	A.31 utt1	That's true.
aa^r	A.31 utt2	That's very true.
b	A.33 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.34 utt1	Well, we definitely need a change in the system
aa	A.35 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.35 utt2	obviously what we are doing is not working, you know.
aa^m	B.36 utt1	It's not working, too .
aa	A.37 utt1	No.
sv	B.38 utt1	It's just piling up on us.
aa	A.39 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.39 utt2	and you know, there's people in our prisons that are not being rehabilitated in any way, shape, or form,
b	B.40 utt1	Right.
sv	A.41 utt1	and either they're in there, forever or when they get out you know, it's a matter of a few months
b	B.42 utt1	Right.
sv	A.43 utt2	and they're going to be right back for the same thing
sv	B.44 utt1	We're just a society not willing to spend the time or the money to do what it takes,
aa	A.45 utt1	That's very true.
b	B.46 utt1	Yeah.
b^m	A.47 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.47 utt2	I was talking to a friend of mine about this the other day
sd(^q)	A.47 utt3	and I said, you know, I understand that there are a lot of countries that rely on the United States, to
^q	A.47 utt4	and, and the, and the people in those countries rely on our money to survive
b	B.48 utt1	Uh huh.
^q	A.49 utt2	but I really believe that we need to take care of ourselves,
b	B.50 utt1	Right.
sv(^q)	A.51 utt3	I know people say, it would be cruel to, you know, pull our aid from these other countries
sv	A.51 utt4	and maybe so,
sv(^q)	A.51 utt5	so tell them, you've got five years. To work out a plan, to make it on your own.
b	B.52 utt1	Right.
b	B.54 utt1	Yeah.
^q	A.55 utt1	And, we will continue funding you for the next two years,
^q	A.55 utt2	after two years we'll cut it down to seventy fiv , you know, seventy five percent.
b	B.56 utt1	Uh huh.
^q	A.57 utt1	And after another year we'll cut it fifty percent,
^q	A.57 utt2	and in five years, it sh ,
^q	A.57 utt3	by then you all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help.
aa	B.58 utt1	Sure.
sv	A.59 utt1	And then we'll have, we will have the money if we would do that to, to work on your own system because we've got some serious problems here
b	B.60 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.61 utt2	and we're trying to, heal the world, you know,
aa^m	B.62 utt1	Very serious, yeah.
sv	A.63 utt2	it's just not, it's just not working.
b	B.64 utt1	yeah ,
aa	B.66 utt1	your right , .
sd	A.67 utt1	I look at what, the aid presented to the Kurds
sd	A.67 utt2	and I feel sorry for them
sv	A.67 utt3	and I know they're suffering
sv	A.67 utt4	and I know they're dying everyday,
sv	A.67 utt5	but we've got, you know, kids here in the United States that are dying everyday, too. You know, and being, abused and neglected
aa	B.68 utt1	Sure.
b	B.70 utt1	Oh .
h	A.71 utt2	and, you know, I don't know.
sv	A.71 utt3	I just have this problem with, trying to heal the world when you're so sick yourself, you know,
ba	B.72 utt1	You bet .
aa	B.74 utt1	Right.
sv	B.74 utt2	Well, we seem to agree on the jury thing
sv	B.74 utt3	but, , we'll need an unanimous verdict
sv	B.74 utt4	and, maybe let the judge have a opportunity to make, a decision .
aa	A.75 utt1	Yep.
sv	A.77 utt1	I think we should try it, like you say,
b	B.78 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.79 utt1	if it doesn't work, we can always come back,
sv	A.79 utt2	but I think it would be a good idea to try it.
aa	B.80 utt1	I do too.
sv	A.81 utt1	So, anyway, well, we all agree.
ba	B.82 utt1	Well, good.
fc	B.84 utt1	Good to hear from you.
fc	A.85 utt1	You too, bye bye.
fc^m	B.86 utt1	Bye bye.
