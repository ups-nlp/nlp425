sd	A.1 utt1	I pay a good deal of taxes I guess, because I make a fair amount of money,
sd	A.1 utt2	and, the taxes that I pay, I guess as a general statement, I feel I guess I get my money's worth for.
b	B.2 utt1	Okay.
sv	A.3 utt2	I guess I am sure that I feel that, in general, though, the allocation, of the taxes in certain areas, isn't correct.
sv	B.4 utt1	Well, I'm sure that, probably every person in this country would agree with you on that. Because everybody has a different idea of where the money should go.
sd	A.7 utt2	lately, I guess, or, at least for the last twenty years or so, I've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost, defense items, at least in the last ten years, have been,
sv	A.7 utt3	there's been and extraordinary amount of money spent there,
sv	A.7 utt4	and I'm not really sure that we've gotten our money's worth there, regardless of the outcome of the Desert Storm, Desert Shield, situations.
b	B.8 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.10 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.11 utt1	I guess my particular beef is that having participated in the military off and on over the years of being called back and things of that nature, is, I've found that, you know, there's an extraordinary amount of waste.
sd	A.11 utt2	I take that as a given in any military operation
aa	B.12 utt1	yeah,
aa	B.12 utt2	no argument here.
b	A.13 utt1	yeah,
sv	A.13 utt3	I should imagine that, that what the problem,
sv	A.13 utt4	why I'm, I'm a little concerned about today is that this, and easy, I don't know, I shouldn't say easy, rather quick victory in, in the, Mideast, over the, Iraqis, might lead us into, a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe.
sd	A.13 utt5	I, I don't know what other foe that would be,
sd	A.13 utt6	but, I'm just getting nervous again, now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area.
b	B.14 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.14 utt2	well, of course, a lot of missiles and things were expended in the course of fighting the war,
sd	B.14 utt3	and the inventory's going to have to be restocked,
sd	B.14 utt5	now I work for T I,
sd	B.14 utt6	and one of the things we were told is, like, they had eleven thousand HARM missiles which T I is the sole supplier for,
sd	B.14 utt7	and they used up two thousand of them in the war,
sd	B.14 utt8	so they're going to have to do another contract to restock that, to get ready in case something else is needed.
b	A.15 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.15 utt5	two thousand out of eleven thousand, that's about a little over twenty per cent.
sd	A.15 utt6	I should imagine that, that would be to keep it at those levels, I guess, that were originally appropriated was when the Soviet threat, I guess, was perceived as being a greater one.
sv	A.15 utt7	I don't think there's very much of a threat there today.
sd	A.15 utt8	I do worry about what nuclear weapons are left in their territory over there, and who's controlling them,
aa	B.16 utt1	that's true,
aa^r	B.16 utt2	that's true.
sd	A.17 utt1	I don't know what amount of, our hardware would stop some fanatic, I guess, from doing anything, that would be irrational.
sd	B.18 utt1	Well, of course now, we used up twenty per cent of that inventory, in a matter of just a few weeks,
b	A.19 utt1	Right.
b	A.21 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.22 utt1	and, T I also makes the missile, which was the T V laser guided bombs
b	A.23 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.24 utt1	and, a big percentage of that was expended, as well,
qw	A.25 utt1	what is the name of that?
sd	B.26 utt1	it's called Paveway.
b	A.27 utt1	Yes,
b^r	A.27 utt2	yes.
sd	B.28 utt1	And, a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also.
sd	B.28 utt2	So those are two areas in which T I stands to gain some short term business to restock that.
b	A.29 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.29 utt6	talking about the taxes in general, and that was an area that I perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for, in the area of defense,
sv	A.29 utt7	or perhaps we have paid too much there,
h	A.29 utt8	I don't know,
sv	A.29 utt9	it just seems to me that over the years, now, the,
sv	A.29 utt10	and it's a cliche,
sv	A.29 utt12	but I see it myself,
sv	A.29 utt13	I see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down, the roads, the highways.
aa	B.30 utt1	no doubt.
h	A.31 utt1	I, I don't know,
sd	A.31 utt2	I'm familiar with some upbeat school areas,
sd	A.31 utt3	so I don't totally agree the great, with the, with the great expenditure of effort and time there,
sv	A.31 utt4	but I guess overall, because I guess I'm not associated with what ghetto schools, and, and, rural school systems are like, I should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure.
aa	B.32 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.32 utt2	as a matter of fact, in Texas, we've had our school funding system declared unconstitutional by a state judge,
sd	B.32 utt4	and, the legislature just passed what they called a Robin Hood Bill, which,
sd	B.32 utt5	basically, what it does, is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts, that are, you know come from local taxes and send them to other parts of the state, that are not so affluent.
b	A.33 utt1	Uh huh.
qy^d	A.35 utt1	they don't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system,
qrr	A.37 utt1	or is it all funded out of local taxes?
^h	B.38 utt1	okay,
sd	B.38 utt2	to give you some perspective, this town that I had lived in for sometime in nineteen eighty three was funded sixty five per cent by state funds.
b	A.39 utt1	Yeah.
sd(^q)	B.40 utt1	Then we had a number of education reforms, that the legislature said, hey, we got to do this, we got to do this, we got to do this,
sd	B.40 utt2	but, they forgot to put in the state budget the money to pay for it,
sd	B.40 utt3	and they dumped it all on the local school districts.
sv	A.41 utt1	Sounds like the way the federal and state system works now.
b	B.42 utt1	Really.
b	A.43 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.44 utt1	So, so what ended up happening was a, was a shift.
sd	B.44 utt2	We went to sixty five per cent state funding to sixty five per cent local funding in a matter of four years. And, I mean,
qy@	A.45 utt1	do you mean a complete reversal? Because, I guess, they can't raise that money in those poorer districts,
na	B.46 utt1	complete.
sd	B.46 utt2	It's all shifted to local districts,
sd	B.46 utt3	and now, even the money that's been raised for the local districts is going to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state.
na	B.48 utt1	That's right,
sd	B.48 utt2	and I have no problem, with, a certain, minimum level, that's a standard that everybody, ought to be able to have,
b	A.49 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.50 utt2	but, I am opposed to, any attempts to restrict, local communities from taxing themselves above that to provide above the minimum.
b	A.51 utt1	Yes,
ba	A.51 utt2	I see what you're saying.
sd	A.51 utt3	I, I do, I, I guess I am a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education.
sd	A.51 utt4	I mean, by that I mean, I'm a product myself,
sd	A.51 utt5	I have, a, a, a background of, getting my college education through the G I Bill.
sd	B.52 utt1	So did I.
sd	B.52 utt2	My Masters, anyway.
sv	A.53 utt2	but, when I look at it to me, it doesn't really make any difference.
sd	A.53 utt3	It was a marvelous opportunity that I couldn't have done,
sd	A.53 utt4	I don't think I would have gone on, unless I had that financial easement made possible.
b	B.54 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.56 utt1	That's right.
sd	A.57 utt1	And I don't really care what it takes to qualify, an ex , whether you're a veteran or whether you,
sd	A.57 utt2	I don't even know if you have to perform community service,
sd	A.57 utt3	or unless, or you promise to even do something in the future, I think that, that, the subsidy itself,
sd	A.57 utt4	or I guess the enactment of that form of legislation, would give many people who, I think, I think I perceive the fact,
b	B.58 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.59 utt2	at least what I read, is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their, budget.
sd	A.59 utt3	I know in the state of Florida just today, the legislature, adjourned,
sd	A.59 utt4	and, they had completed a fifteen per cent increase in the, state land grant colleges, which isn't, I mean,
sv	A.59 utt5	to me it doesn't sound like a lot of money,
sv	A.59 utt6	but I guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year.
b	B.60 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.61 utt1	They went from eleven to fifteen hundred,
b	B.62 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.63 utt1	and, for an out of state student the tuition went up twenty five per cent.
sd	A.63 utt2	I don't know what that would be.
b	B.64 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.64 utt2	they had to raise, community college taxes here, a few years ago.
sv	A.65 utt1	But I guess that goes along with the general idea that the federal government was expending so much money on defense, that the program now is,
sv	A.65 utt2	fees that fund these things, I guess that's trickled down to the states
sv	A.65 utt3	and, the states don't have enough money
b	B.66 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.67 utt2	so they must charge fees.
sd	A.67 utt3	I'm not too sure of that reasoning.
b	B.68 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.69 utt1	But I guess to get back to the main topic, I don't know whether I pay too much taxes.
sd	A.69 utt2	I, I travel extensively in Europe and see enormous,
sd	A.69 utt3	people pay, a great deal in taxes,
sd	A.69 utt4	they tell me when I sit and talk to people
sd	A.69 utt5	there they tell me they,
sd	A.69 utt6	some states they pay,
sd	A.69 utt7	in Germany or in England in some cases people in my income level, at least, allege that they pay up to fifty five percent of their gross income in taxes.
ba	B.70 utt1	I can believe that.
sd	A.71 utt1	but, I'm not too sure when I put my property tax in, my car tax, my income tax, and these myriad of,
sd	A.71 utt2	now it costs me money to leave the country, some sort of a tax to leave the country, some sort of an airport departure tax, a sales tax which is getting to, quite high levels,
b	B.72 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.72 utt2	yeah.
sd	A.73 utt2	I'm not sure that I'm not up fairly close to that.
sv	B.74 utt1	Well, I guarantee you'd be paying a lot more in taxes if, the Democrats had more say.
qy	A.75 utt1	You really think so?
ny	B.76 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.76 utt2	I really do.
sd	A.77 utt2	I feel that in the last ten years, my taxes have gone up,
sd	A.77 utt3	they haven't gone down.
sd	A.77 utt4	I pay quite a bit more taxes
b	B.78 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.80 utt1	everybody is.
sv	A.81 utt1	but that's been a Republican government for the last ten years.
sv	B.82 utt1	Well, what, what they've been able to do is slow down the rate of increase . to keep it from becoming even more obnoxious.
b	A.85 utt1	Yeah.
fc	B.86 utt1	Well, this has been really interesting,
fc	B.86 utt2	and I've enjoyed our talk.
fc	@A.87 utt1	Okay,
fc^t	@A.87 utt2	I guess I just push something here.
fc^t	@A.87 utt3	Push one again, right?
fc	B.88 utt1	No,
fc^t	B.88 utt2	we just say good bye
fc	B.88 utt3	and that's it.
fc^t	A.89 utt1	Just hang up.
fc	A.89 utt2	Okay,
fc	A.89 utt3	Don, good talking with you.
fc	B.90 utt1	Nice talking with you, too.
fc	A.91 utt1	Bye bye.
fc^m	B.92 utt1	Bye bye.
