sd	A.1 utt1	Well, I'm, pretty pro gun control over all.
sd	A.1 utt2	I've had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control
sd	A.1 utt3	and, I must say that there are a couple of arguments against, strong gun control which I find very compelling, although most the people who argue gun control with me I find, use sort of canned arguments, you know, sort of the N R A slogan arguments
sd	A.1 utt4	and, see I've been very frustrated when I do debate with people about it.
sd	A.1 utt5	I guess on a scale of one of ten I'm probably around a two in terms of fair restricting guns
sd	A.1 utt6	and I have to admit most of that is, strong personal distaste.
sd	A.1 utt7	I don't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very little effort.
sd	A.1 utt8	and, guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me.
sd	B.2 utt1	Well, me being from Texas ,
b	A.3 utt1	Uh huh.
qy^d	B.4 utt1	I hope you're ready for this.
na	A.5 utt1	I'll give it a try.
sd	A.5 utt2	I've got my Texan stereotypes in place.
sd	B.6 utt1	Well, I'm not your stereotypical Texan.
sd	B.6 utt2	I was raised around guns, hunting.
b	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.8 utt1	So I don't have a fear of fire arms in any respect.
b	A.9 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.10 utt1	I respect them and what their capabilities are.
b	A.11 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.12 utt1	And on top of that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military, as a Green Beret, I definitely respect the power of weaponry.
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
qy^g	A.13 utt2	It's pretty power isn't it ?
sd	B.14 utt1	And here in Houston, as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country,
^h	B.14 utt2	and here, here you go,
sd	B.14 utt4	this will be border line N R A which I am not a member of.
b	A.15 utt1	Okay.
b^r	A.15 utt2	Okay.
qy^d	B.16 utt1	When I mean, you've heard the slogan, if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns.
ny	A.17 utt1	Uh huh.
sv(^q)	A.17 utt2	That applies to anything as well as guns.
sv	B.18 utt2	well, any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs
sv	B.18 utt3	and they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such,
b	A.19 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.20 utt1	And they get out their little Mac tens,
sv	B.20 utt2	they get out there little uzis
sv	B.20 utt3	and they're going to fight with them.
sv	B.20 utt4	And it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm.
sv	B.20 utt5	If they want it they'll get it.
sv	B.20 utt6	I don't care if they've got to go down into New Mexico to get it
sv	B.20 utt7	they'll get it
sv	B.20 utt8	and they'll get across the border.
sd	B.20 utt9	Now my position, although, I have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon, anyway.
b	A.21 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.22 utt2	Since I am a law abiding citizen and I have never had a felony, if I wanted to buy one, I don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it.
sd	B.22 utt3	If they want to run a background check on me, fine.
sd	B.22 utt4	If they want to put a seven day waiting period, fine, again.
b	A.23 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.24 utt1	If they want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that I've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county, that's fine too.
b	A.25 utt1	Uh huh.
b^r	A.25 utt2	Uh huh.
sv	A.25 utt3	What I don't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because pretty soon it wouldn't,
sv	A.25 utt4	you don't want to have someone making a personal trust in that way, I would hope. I mean, because I mean someone
sd	A.25 utt5	the personal sheriff doesn't get to have a gun
x	A.27 utt1	,
sv(^q)	B.28 utt1	well, the criteria the sheriff would have to follow is this guy a convicted felon?
^q	B.28 utt2	is he a habitual trouble maker?
^q	B.28 utt3	Are we picking him up every Saturday, for a drunk and disorderly
b	A.29 utt1	Yeah.
^q	B.30 utt2	and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems.
sv	B.30 utt3	You know, just proving that you're a basically a good citizen.
sv	A.31 utt1	But if you're not a basically good citizen,
sv	A.31 utt2	you just told me that you're going to get one of those guns anyway.
sv	B.32 utt1	if they want the firepower they can get it.
sv	B.34 utt1	because it doesn't matter how restrictive you're border control points are
sv	B.34 utt2	they'll get it across the border one way or the other.
qh	A.35 utt1	So why have any restrictions at all?
b	B.36 utt1	okay.
ad	B.36 utt3	go back to that one to ten scale where one, being, full gun control, ten being none.
b	A.41 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.43 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.44 utt1	I'd said about an eight.
b	A.45 utt1	Uh huh.
b^r	A.45 utt2	Uh huh.
sd	B.46 utt1	I said the restrictions I would like to see for anybody, whether it being for handgun, a rifle, a shotgun,
sd	B.46 utt2	I would like to see them go through either,
sd	B.46 utt3	I'd like to see a law enforcement agency, not N R A,
sv	B.46 utt4	but whether it be your state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a handgun.
sv	B.46 utt5	You got to go through there course and get certified that you know how to properly handle the weapon, how to safely handle the weapon, how to properly maintain it, the three basics.
aa	A.47 utt1	Well, that makes a lot of since to me.
sv	A.47 utt2	I mean, I certainly feel that if, we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm
aa	A.47 utt3	but, I certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility to know how do, use it safely as someone learns how to drive, if not more so.
sv	B.48 utt2	in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as the weapon, as a pistol.
b	A.49 utt1	Yeah .
sd	A.51 utt1	Well, I have a bicycle
sd	A.51 utt2	and that scares me too to tell you the truth because I've been run off the road and all sorts of things.
qw	A.51 utt3	Well, I'm still puzzled though, what is the argument,
qw	A.51 utt4	how does the argument work if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway.
qw	A.51 utt5	What's the point of putting a restrictio ,
sv	A.51 utt6	basically, the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway
sv	A.51 utt7	they're not going to take those courses.
qy	A.51 utt8	is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns?
sv	A.53 utt1	If it's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices
qy	A.53 utt2	does that, mean advantage?
ng	B.54 utt1	not necessarily a price thing.
sd	B.54 utt2	What is happening at least in this state
sv	B.54 utt3	and I expect to see it in other states very soon,
sd	B.54 utt4	legislation been introduced that, if a citizen of the state, being, myself, has not committed a felony and has completed a certified weapons course, I can carry a weapon on me at all times concealed or uncon , unconcealed.
b	A.55 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.57 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.58 utt1	Okay.
qy^g	B.58 utt2	you're, you're from California, right?
ny	A.59 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	B.60 utt1	L A area?
nn	A.61 utt1	no.
sd^e	A.61 utt2	Bay area.
sd	A.61 utt3	San Francisco, Bay area.
bk	B.62 utt1	Okay.
bk	B.64 utt1	Okay.
qy	B.64 utt2	You've been to the city?
ny	A.65 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.66 utt1	And all these people come around,
sv	B.66 utt2	someone attempts to mug me I would ju ,
sd	B.66 utt4	as it stands now if he pulls a blade on me we're equally matched because I can meet him blade for blade.
b	A.67 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.68 utt1	Now if this legislation comes through,
sd	B.68 utt3	I'm out with my family
b	A.69 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.70 utt1	we've gone shopping,
sd	B.70 utt2	we're fixing to get in the car,
sd	B.70 utt3	this guy comes up,
sd	B.70 utt4	he pulls a blade on me.
sd	B.70 utt5	I can pull a gun on him now.
sv	B.70 utt6	and when you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick.
qw	A.71 utt1	What if you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon?
sv	B.72 utt1	Then it's still equally matched.
sd	B.72 utt2	Having, having spent time in combat I feel, I feel it before they'll get the gun on me.
b	A.75 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.78 utt1	If I'm, at the same, time.
b	A.79 utt1	I'm sure,
sv	A.81 utt1	I'm sure given all, given all your training I'm sure that, you know, you'd,
sd	A.83 utt2	if I walk into a bad neighborhood I'm sure I'd want to walk through with you because I'm sure you have you know, fa , far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything.
sv	A.83 utt3	I'm, quite concerned that if you let everyone
sv	A.83 utt4	haven't, hasn't yet committed a felony,
sv	A.83 utt5	if you let them all walk around carrying guns
sv	A.83 utt6	in this sort of wild west scenario, you're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature.
sv	A.83 utt7	You're going to start getting a lot of gunfire.
sd	A.83 utt8	it's hard for me to imagine that a situation of, you know,
ad	A.83 utt9	take it to a logical extreme,
sv	A.83 utt10	if everyone walking around carrying a guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire.
sv	B.84 utt2	it's more of a police action in itself,
sv(^q)	B.84 utt3	the fact that everybody is packing a piece is a deterrence for someone saying, well, I'm going to mug this guy right here
^q	B.84 utt4	but hey, he's carrying just as much firepower as I can.
sv	B.84 utt5	And if they're sca , if you got to go through a certification course to get to where you can carry it in public, then this individual also knows this guys pretty good with it.
b	A.85 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.86 utt2	Now whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not, that's another trip,
b	A.87 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.89 utt1	Uh huh
b	A.91 utt1	Uh huh.
b^r	A.91 utt2	Uh huh.
sd	B.92 utt1	In defense of myself, defense of my family or defense of my friends I can blow somebody a way in a heart beat. even more so when it comes to my wife and son.
b	A.93 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.95 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.96 utt1	Anybody, anybody tries to hurt them I won't even blink,
ba	A.97 utt1	I know,
aa	A.99 utt1	No.
ba	A.99 utt2	I understand that.
qw	A.99 utt3	what if you think someone's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake?
sv	B.100 utt1	this is where the question of gun control comes in.
aa	A.101 utt1	Yeah.
sd^t	A.101 utt2	Well, that, that was the topic.
sv	B.102 utt1	What, I consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot.
b	A.105 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.106 utt2	all of a sudden my combat in me goes up
sd	B.106 utt3	and say I've got the vibes, this guys fixing to do something,
sd	B.106 utt4	I go ahead and pull my piece.
b	A.107 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.108 utt1	And I make sure this persons sees it so that he's got now doubt that I will use it on him
sd	B.108 utt2	and I will use it right then.
b	A.109 utt1	Uh huh.
sv(^q)	B.110 utt1	If he doesn't back up at that point he deserves what he gets because I have sent the clearest signal you mess with me, you mess with my family, I'm going to dust you.
sd	B.110 utt2	As it stands now I've got to do that with a blade.
sd	B.110 utt3	And the only reason I feel com , com , comfortable doing that is because of the training I've had.
b	A.111 utt1	Uh huh.
b^r	A.111 utt2	Uh huh.
sd	A.111 utt3	Well as someone who would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander, I feel more comfortable with people having blades because, you're not going to get bullets flying around killing people instantly
sd	B.112 utt1	Well, if I'm the one doing the shooting I don't miss.
sd	B.112 utt2	That's the kind of training I've had.
