qo	A.1 utt1	So, how do you feel about the crime in your city?
sd	B.2 utt1	Well, Minneapolis isn't too bad.
sd	B.2 utt2	I know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders.
b	A.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.4 utt1	that's kind of gone up in scale and some other things.
sd	B.4 utt2	I personally had a little experience the other day.
sd	B.4 utt3	somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck.
b	A.5 utt1	really.
sd	B.6 utt1	But, actually, you know, when you look at Minneapolis as compared to where I used to live, it's really quite a bit better. because I came from Florida
b	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.8 utt2	and in Orlando, crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever,
b	A.9 utt1	yeah.
qw	B.10 utt1	What part of California are you from?
sd	A.11 utt1	San Jose, California.
bh	B.12 utt1	really?
sd	B.12 utt2	I have a good friend there.
sd	A.13 utt1	Here, you know, the real problems are the gangs.
b	B.14 utt1	Yeah .
sd	A.15 utt1	a lot of murders, just in general the whole,
sd	A.15 utt2	we've only been here a couple of years.
sd	A.15 utt3	before that we lived in Colorado
sd	A.15 utt4	but in comparison to Colorado, it's real noticeable.
aa	B.16 utt1	yeah.
aa	B.16 utt2	Uh huh.
sd	A.17 utt2	I mean I won't go to the grocery store at night.
aa	B.18 utt1	Yeah.
aa^r	B.18 utt2	Yeah,
b	A.19 utt1	You know.
sd	A.19 utt2	And it's that kind of thing
sv	B.20 utt1	That's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like,
aa	A.21 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.21 utt2	We have a neighborhood watch program in the development that we live in, which I think is a great way to reduce, home theft, burglary, and things of that sort.
b	B.22 utt1	Sure.
qy	A.23 utt2	Do you have that where you live
sd	B.24 utt1	Well, interestingly enough, right before I moved up here,
sd	B.24 utt2	I'm an intern
sd	B.24 utt3	and then I go back down in May.
b	A.25 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.26 utt2	but in Orlando, before I moved up, we had a real problem with it.
sd	B.26 utt3	we've been broken into in my apartment about four times in like two and a half weeks.
ba	A.27 utt1	no.
sd	B.28 utt2	And one of the things that I helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation down there.
b	A.29 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.30 utt3	it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work, you know,
b	A.31 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.32 utt2	and then the houses were left unguarded,
sv	B.32 utt4	I think given that people are pretty conscientious about it,
sv	B.32 utt5	that's a good way to work it, with a neighborhood watch.
b	A.33 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.35 utt1	Well, you know, also I've heard that, the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home. Like on the weekends.
bh	B.36 utt1	is that right?
sd	A.37 utt3	I think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is, spent doing yard work outdoors.
b	B.38 utt1	Oh.
sv	A.39 utt2	So they wait while you're outdoors.
sv	A.39 utt3	They know the house is unlocked
sv	A.39 utt4	and then they just slip in. Slip in, slip out, you know.
ba	B.40 utt1	That's amazing.
sv	A.41 utt2	They know exactly what they're going for.
b	B.42 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.43 utt1	So, I've heard that's really on the rise as far as you know, a new type of crime.
aa	B.46 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.46 utt2	it almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter.
b	A.47 utt1	Yeah .
b	B.48 utt1	Really, you know.
aa	A.49 utt1	Unfortunately, yes.
b	B.50 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.50 utt2	unfortunately it's starting to really, you know, look at people's habits and where they are at particular points of the day.
b	A.51 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.53 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.54 utt1	Like one of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he's from Detroit
b	A.55 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.56 utt1	and, the crime level there, of course, is quite a bit, more pronounced,
b	A.57 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.58 utt1	but, yeah.
sd	B.60 utt1	I think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis,
h	B.60 utt2	I'm not real sure.
b	A.61 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.61 utt2	it helps to know your neighbors, you know.
sv	A.61 utt4	you're supposed to make lists of, cars.
sd	A.61 utt5	Like I know a lot of my neighbors right around my development. If I see a car that's unfamiliar, we have a list
qy	A.61 utt6	is that what you did in your program? Where you have a list of license plates?
na	B.62 utt1	Pretty much.
b	A.63 utt1	Yeah.
b^m	B.64 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.64 utt2	I was basically, involved in that, in the organization of it.
b	A.65 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.66 utt1	And then I left right in the middle of it.
sd	B.66 utt2	I'm not sure where we went from there,
b	A.67 utt1	uh huh.
b	A.69 utt1	Yeah. Well.
b^m	B.70 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.70 utt2	that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings, noticing people who look suspicious activities like that, sure.
b	A.71 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.73 utt1	I mean, you hate to be paranoid
sv	A.73 utt2	but there are really only so many things you can do.
sv	A.73 utt3	You can have the house alarm, neighborhood watch program, you know, as a woman not go out at night
b	B.74 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.76 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.77 utt1	you can do that which is what I choose to do.
aa	B.78 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.78 utt2	One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited
b	A.79 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.80 utt1	even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps,
b	A.81 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.82 utt2	it's against the law to do a lot of things, you know.
sd	B.82 utt4	when I was getting robbed down in Florida, I was really considering electrifying doors things like that like
aa	A.83 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.85 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.86 utt1	they did in Miami that time.
sv	A.87 utt2	if you kill someone in your home, as long as they are in your home, it's considered self defense though.
ar	B.88 utt1	That's not always true.
bh	A.89 utt1	It isn't?
nn	B.90 utt1	No.
sd^e	B.90 utt2	there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed
b	A.91 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.92 utt2	and essentially what he had done is set a elec , a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home.
b	A.93 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.96 utt1	The guy came in while he was home
sd	B.96 utt2	and, sure enough, he fell into the trap and was severely burned.
sd	B.96 utt3	He didn't die,
sd	B.96 utt4	but he was severely burned
sd	B.96 utt5	and he took the guy to court and won a settlement.
bh	A.97 utt1	Really.
ny	B.98 utt1	Yeah.
sv^e	B.98 utt2	So that makes you think, you know.
b	A.99 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.100 utt1	It's like your hands are very much tied.
aa	A.101 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.101 utt2	Well I think if you had a handgun though, in other words it wasn't premeditated, you had a handgun, it's the middle of the night, someone's down ,
