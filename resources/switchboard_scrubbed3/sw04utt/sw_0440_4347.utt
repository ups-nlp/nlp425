o	B.1 utt1	Okay,
qw	B.1 utt2	so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products?
sd	A.2 utt1	not too bad really.
sd	A.2 utt2	I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I really didn't want it,
sd	A.2 utt3	but I got it anyway
sd	A.2 utt4	and, it was a Braun
sd	A.2 utt5	and they were real good about taking it back.
sd	A.2 utt6	It wasn't a problem at all,
sd	A.2 utt7	so, I was able to get that back pretty easily.
b	B.3 utt1	Uh huh.
h	A.4 utt1	But, I don't know,
sd	A.4 utt2	I really haven't returned a whole lot lately.
qy	A.4 utt3	Have you?
ng	B.5 utt1	I haven't had to.
sd	B.5 utt4	I mean, I, I'm almost pushing it myself.
sd	B.5 utt5	Maybe I'll buy a shirt from G I Joe's
sd	B.5 utt6	and it shrinks too much
sd(^q)	B.5 utt7	and say, well, I should have known better,
sd	B.5 utt8	I mean, I bought it from G I Joe's
sv	B.7 utt1	and it was probably made in China by slaves.
b	A.8 utt1	Right .
sd	B.9 utt2	most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway, I get pretty good stuff.
b	A.10 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.11 utt1	I think that, aside from the fact all markets being internationalized
aa	A.12 utt1	Right
sv	B.13 utt1	and if you want to buy American , it takes real extra work to find.
aa	A.14 utt1	Exactly.
sv	B.15 utt1	It's probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the U S .
aa	A.18 utt1	Right,
sd	A.18 utt2	I was reading something in, CONSUMER REPORTS tonight about that as a matter of fact.
sd	A.18 utt3	They were talking about cars, the car issue just came out. And about how, yeah, you'd like to buy an American car maybe
b	B.19 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.20 utt2	but, you know, the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever.
b	B.21 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.22 utt1	like I've got an eighty six Ford Ranger
sd	A.22 utt2	and I know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi.
qh	A.24 utt1	You know, so it's like, what are you going to do, you know?
aa	B.25 utt1	Yeah,
aa	B.25 utt2	really.
sv	A.26 utt1	But, that's the way it is.
h	A.26 utt2	I don't know,
sv	A.26 utt3	I personally feel that, if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them, you know, that's the way it goes
sv	A.26 utt4	and, you know, people, more than manufacturers should get a clue
sv	A.26 utt5	and, you know, they should start making quality products.
aa	B.27 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.27 utt2	I think they're beginning to.
sv	B.27 utt3	the days of don't buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away
sd	A.28 utt1	That's what I thought, too, until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue.
b	B.29 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.30 utt1	they've got well, all the, all the cars rated, you know,
sv	A.30 utt2	and, essentially, I don't see much of a trend.
sv	A.30 utt3	I mean, just like every other time that you look at it, the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there.
sv	A.30 utt4	There's nothing wrong with them. and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars.
sv	A.30 utt5	But then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy
sv	A.30 utt6	and they're pieces of junk.
aa	B.31 utt1	I know.
aa	B.31 utt2	Still at it, hey.
b	A.32 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.32 utt2	that's eighty six through ninety one.
ba	B.33 utt1	Wow.
h	A.34 utt1	But, I don't know,
sv	A.34 utt2	maybe they're getting better,
sv	A.34 utt3	maybe they're starting to get a clue.
sd	B.35 utt1	Well, they got a three year lead time.
sv	B.35 utt2	It probably won't start really showing up until ninety four or so .
aa	A.36 utt1	Yeah,
aa	A.36 utt2	that's just it.
sv	A.36 utt3	Technology that comes in right now is probably not going to be implemented until, you know, quite a few years down the road.
sv	B.37 utt1	The computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer.
aa	A.38 utt1	yeah.
aa^r	A.38 utt2	Yeah,
sv	A.38 utt3	because technology is so, you know, volatile and changing all the time.
qh	B.39 utt1	And can you think of any other industry where in software they,
sv	B.41 utt2	if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out, you'll get a free version in the mail s , .
b	A.42 utt1	Yeah.
sv(^q)	B.43 utt1	Or, maybe I say, well, you know, you paid five hundred bucks for this program, so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade.
b	A.44 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.46 utt2	uh, they keep up with it pretty quickly
sv	A.46 utt3	and that's a real good thing, I guess.
b	B.47 utt1	Yeah.
h	A.48 utt1	I don't know.
sv	B.49 utt1	And well, I mean, all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity
sv	B.49 utt2	and the MacIntosh is about the only one that's going right forcing I B M and the rest of the D O S world to follow along.
b	A.50 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.52 utt1	Right,
sv	A.52 utt2	they're kind of the leaders right now, you know.
sd	A.52 utt3	I used to see all those commercials for Windows, you know,
sv(^q)	A.52 utt4	and you're like, gee, they're reselling a MacIntosh under a different name.
aa	B.55 utt1	Really,
qh	B.55 utt2	why don't they just say, almost a Mac for half the price.
b	A.56 utt1	Yeah, you know.
sv	B.57 utt1	They'd sell more if they were honest.
aa	A.58 utt1	Exactly,
sv	A.58 utt2	almost is the key word, there, too, you know, because I really, I've used both
sv	A.58 utt3	and I really don't see an advantage of Windows at all.
sv	B.59 utt1	Yeah, it it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure D O S. base.
aa	A.62 utt1	yeah that's true, too.
h	A.64 utt1	But, I don't know,
sd	A.64 utt2	I've gotten a little bit out of the personal computer business just because I don't have one at home.
sd	A.64 utt3	I do use a Mac at work
sd	A.64 utt4	but, I really don't do much with it at home
b	B.65 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.67 utt1	Apple's sort of making a s ,
sv	B.67 utt2	and they're ones were
sv	B.67 utt3	growling consumer, need to worry about the Mac they're getting,
sd	B.67 utt4	like if you bought a power book straight off, a lot of them had to go back.
sd	B.67 utt5	They issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive.
b	A.68 utt1	Right.
aa	A.70 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	A.70 utt2	Yeah,
qy^d	A.70 utt3	you sound like you must, work in the computer business.
ny	B.71 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.71 utt2	I have one,
sd	B.71 utt3	I do desktop publishing at work
sd	B.71 utt4	and I have a machine at home
sd	B.71 utt5	and I belong to the user's group
sd	B.71 utt6	and I've been a Mac fanatic since they came out.
bh	A.72 utt1	Yeah?
sd	B.73 utt1	But, technically, I'm not actually in the industry.
sd	B.73 utt2	I don't work a computer company.
bh	A.74 utt1	No?
sd	B.75 utt1	I'm an abuser.
ba	A.76 utt1	Well, that's all right.
sv	B.77 utt1	But it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to you know, keep up with the changes as they happen.
aa	A.78 utt1	Yeah,
aa	A.78 utt2	that's true.
sv	A.80 utt1	Something that I find uncomfortable is, you know, you want to buy something, say you want to buy a personal computer
sv	A.80 utt2	and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for, you know,
sd	A.80 utt3	let's take the example, the modem for, you know,
b	B.81 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.82 utt1	Okay,
qh	A.82 utt2	w , what baud rate do you get?
sd	A.82 utt3	Well, you know, it used to be that you get a twelve hundred ba ,
