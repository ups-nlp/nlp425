sd	A.43 utt5	It was pretty nice,
sd	A.43 utt6	but, no, I have, I had a boat last summer that I took out, a catamaran that I did a lot of sailing on and stuff.
bh	B.44 utt1	Yeah?
ba	A.45 utt1	That's a lot of fun,
sd	A.45 utt2	but, my parents are pretty big sailors, too,
sd	A.45 utt3	they're kind of into it.
sd	B.46 utt1	all we have up here mostly bass boats.
b	A.47 utt1	yeah,

ny	B.48 utt1	Uh huh.

qw	A.53 utt2	what major city is nearby?
sd	B.54 utt1	Houston.
bk	A.55 utt1	Okay,
qr	A.55 utt2	and that's south or north of there or something?

sd	B.56 utt2	Houston's north.
bh	A.57 utt1	Yeah?
bk	A.57 utt2	Okay.
sd	B.58 utt1	Dallas is south.
bk	A.59 utt1	okay,
bk	A.59 utt2	all right.
ba	A.59 utt3	Well, that sounds pretty good.
qy	A.59 utt6	does that stay pretty constant there
ng	B.60 utt1	it's gets cold at night, and then warm in the afternoons.
bh	A.61 utt1	Yeah?
sd	B.62 utt1	Probably eighties in the afternoon.
bk	A.63 utt1	Okay,
ba	A.63 utt2	well, that's pretty temperate.
ba	A.63 utt4	that's not too bad.
qy	A.63 utt6	have you done, any other boating then
nn	B.64 utt1	No,
sd^e	B.64 utt2	I hadn't done any lately,
sd	B.64 utt3	but that's all,
sd	B.64 utt4	I used to have a friend that his daddy owned a boat shop.
bh	A.65 utt1	Yeah?
sd	B.66 utt1	And when I was in high school, we used to go boating every day just about.
ba	A.67 utt1	that's great.
sd	B.68 utt1	And we had a different boat every day.
ba	A.69 utt1	that's fantastic.
sd	A.69 utt3	I used to, kind of be that way myself when I lived in, north western Florida in the panhandle,
sd	A.69 utt4	I used to sail about every day.
sd	A.69 utt5	I'd go to work,
sd	B.70 utt1	I'd like to do some sailing.
b	A.71 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.71 utt2	it's a lot of fun.
sd	A.71 utt4	especially if you get a pretty fast boat
sd	A.71 utt5	like those catamarans are pretty fast.
aa	B.72 utt1	Yeah,
qy	B.74 utt1	if you get one like that do have somebody teach you that
nd	A.75 utt1	Well, actually, I've known how to sail pretty much my whole life.
sd	A.75 utt2	my family's pretty into it
b	B.76 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.77 utt1	and, I took sailing lessons when I was about six
qy	B.78 utt1	Is it pretty easy?
ny	A.79 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.79 utt2	it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while, you know, just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and the physics behind it.
b	B.80 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.81 utt1	So it's not too bad,
sd	A.81 utt2	it's pretty easy to get the hang of, I think
sd	A.81 utt3	and, generally, everybody I've known has kind of gotten into it,
sv	A.81 utt4	but some people are more motorboaters, you know which is fine.
b	B.82 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.84 utt1	Well, that's about all we have .
b	A.85 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.85 utt2	yeah,
sv	A.85 utt3	lot of people don't see the excitement in sailing,
sv	A.85 utt4	but, then, again, m , they may never have tried anything like, catamaran
b	B.86 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.87 utt1	and, that's when you really start getting into speed. You know,
sd	A.87 utt2	some catamarans you can actually pull people behind, the skiers,
sd	A.87 utt3	they get so fast, you know.
sd	B.88 utt1	I didn't know that.
b	A.89 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.89 utt2	they get pretty quick,
ba	B.90 utt1	That that would be something.
aa	A.93 utt1	Yeah,
aa^r	A.93 utt2	yeah,
sd	A.93 utt3	I haven't personally done that,
sd	A.93 utt5	I work with a guy right now that, races catamarans in the summertime
b	B.94 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.95 utt1	and, he's pretty gassed about it.
sd	A.95 utt2	He's got a good,
qw	B.96 utt1	what lake do you all use?
nd	A.97 utt1	Well, he's from Detroit
b	B.98 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.99 utt1	so he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes, I think, and does his sailing.
sd	A.99 utt2	for me, I go back to Orlando, in about a month, and so, down there, basically just go to the coast.
sd	A.99 utt3	We're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast,
sd	A.99 utt4	and there's a lot of places there you can go, you know.
sd	A.99 utt5	so that's a good thing.
b	B.100 utt1	Yeah.
qw	A.101 utt1	yeah, so, what do you do for a job?
sd	B.102 utt1	I build transformers.
bh	A.103 utt1	really?
ny	B.104 utt1	Yeah.
bk	A.105 utt1	Okay,
qy	A.105 utt2	is that for T I
nn	B.106 utt1	No,
sd^e	B.106 utt2	it's for Cooper Industries.
bk	A.107 utt1	Okay.
qy	A.107 utt2	Are they primarily electronic, then?
ny	B.108 utt1	Yeah.
bk	A.109 utt1	Okay.
sd	B.112 utt1	they have a, you know, worldwide,
b	A.113 utt1	Right.
sd	B.114 utt1	all we do here is make transformers electronics and stuff like that.
b	A.115 utt1	okay.
ba	A.117 utt1	Great.
qo	A.117 utt3	how do you like it down there in Texas?
sd	B.118 utt1	It's real nice.
bh	A.119 utt1	Yeah?
sd	B.120 utt1	Been here all my life.
ba	A.121 utt1	no doubt.
b	B.122 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.123 utt1	Okay.
sd	A.123 utt2	I've never been to Texas.
sd	A.123 utt3	I've been to Oklahoma,
sd	B.124 utt1	Oklahoma's nothing like it.
bh	A.125 utt1	Yeah?
sd	A.125 utt3	well, that's good, because I didn't like Oklahoma that well .
