o	A.1 utt1	I guess I've had to return something
sd	A.1 utt2	but can't decide,
sd	A.1 utt3	mostly it's been because I didn't like the color,
b	B.2 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.3 utt1	or, I'm not sure whether I've had to return that many things,
sd	B.4 utt1	Well, I'm having a problem right now with a computer that we've just returned.
bh	A.5 utt1	are you?
sd	B.6 utt1	So, for me it's actually a pretty good topic.
b	A.7 utt1	Okay,
ba	A.7 utt2	good,
ad	A.7 utt3	so, we'll talk about that some.
aa	B.8 utt1	Yeah,
oo	B.8 utt2	well, we could talk about that,
oo	B.8 utt3	and then we could talk a bit about, just quality of products in general, if they're better or worse like if they last longer or something like that.
b	A.9 utt1	Right.
aa	A.11 utt1	Okay,
ad	A.11 utt2	I'm going to let you kind of lead the pack, because you sound like you're,
^h	A.13 utt3	let me tell you just a little bit about myself.
sd	A.13 utt4	for years I did all that shopping and whatnot,
sd	A.13 utt5	but for the last four or five years I've had eye problem,
b	B.14 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.15 utt1	and I've had two cornea transplants.
sd	A.15 utt2	Shopping is no fun anymore .
ba	B.16 utt1	I can imagine.
sd	A.17 utt1	I can't see good enough, you know,
sd	A.17 utt2	and, it's hard to tell what I'm doing,
sd	A.17 utt3	and it's just aggrav ,
qy^d	B.18 utt1	You can't read labels
sd	A.19 utt1	I just thought of something we have to return .
ba	B.20 utt1	Good.
ba	B.20 utt2	There you go.
b	A.21 utt1	All right.
sv	A.21 utt2	it'll come to us,
qy	A.21 utt3	okay? .
na^m	B.22 utt1	Okay.
qy^t	A.23 utt1	Are you ready?
ny	B.24 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.25 utt1	Laurie, all right .
b	B.26 utt1	Right.
b	A.27 utt1	All right,
ad	A.27 utt2	tell me about your computer, Laurie,
sv	A.27 utt3	I think that sounds fascinating.
sd	B.28 utt1	Well, we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project,
sd	B.28 utt2	and we called up the company and asked them details on it.
sd	B.28 utt3	We bought not a name brand because the clones are so much cheaper.
b	A.29 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.30 utt1	And we called up the company that somebody else we knew had dealt with,
sd	B.30 utt2	and they were very happy with the system,
sd	B.30 utt3	and they felt they've gotten a good price.
sd	B.30 utt4	And we went in,
sd	B.30 utt5	we explained what we needed
ny	B.30 utt6	and yes
sd	B.30 utt7	we had to go across the George Washington Bridge to New Jersey to meet these people.
b	A.31 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.32 utt1	And so we went there,
sd	B.32 utt2	we told them about the stuff
sd	B.32 utt3	and the guy said, that the computer would fit our needs.
qy^d	B.32 utt5	these things won't make any sense to you probably
sd	B.32 utt6	but he told us we need user positions to put our own equipment in the computer.
b	A.33 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.35 utt1	yes.
sd	B.36 utt1	And it's called a user boards
sd	B.36 utt2	or slots is what it's called.
b	A.37 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.38 utt1	And he told us there's sorry, two six , four sixteen bit slots and two eight bit slots available for the user,
sd	B.38 utt2	and we can put full size cards in there.
sd(^q)	B.38 utt3	And so we said, great, you know,
^q	B.38 utt4	we'll buy it,
sd	B.38 utt5	and we put in our order.
sd	B.38 utt6	And a week later we went back and picked up the computer.
sd	B.38 utt7	And then we got it home and tried to put our own board in it
sd	B.38 utt8	and there's only one slot we could put it in.
ba	A.39 utt1	lovely.
sd	B.40 utt1	And at this point we only have one board
sd	B.40 utt2	so it wasn't so bad
sd	B.40 utt3	so we used it a bit,
sd	B.40 utt4	but we tried to figure out whether we could put three in because we really need to be able to put at least three in.
ba	A.43 utt1	no ,
qy^d	A.43 utt2	the computer was supposed to have two.
nd	B.44 utt1	Well, it has them
sd	B.44 utt2	but the problem is that you can't put the type of card that we need to put in it, in it. And even though they told us in advance that you could,
b	A.45 utt1	I see.
sd	B.46 utt2	they told us there would be no problem because, you know, the salesman just doesn't really know.
b	A.47 utt1	I see.
sv	A.49 utt1	In some ways it has more to do with the people who sold it.
sv	A.49 utt2	They probably didn't know what they were talking about.
aa	B.50 utt1	Right.
aa	B.50 utt2	That's completely it.
sd	B.50 utt3	The salesman didn't know.
b	A.51 utt1	Right.
sd	B.52 utt1	So, we went back in,
sd	B.52 utt2	and we struck an agreement with the people
sd	B.52 utt3	who said change the casing it comes in so that we could put in extra boards.
b	B.54 utt1	Okay.
sd	B.54 utt2	So they did that.
sd(^q)	B.54 utt3	And we said are you sure this will work,
^q	B.54 utt4	we don't want you to go through the work and then find out that this doesn't really work anyway, and et cetera,
sd	B.54 utt5	and they were doing it at their own costs.
sd(^q)	B.54 utt6	so we said, fine.
sd	B.54 utt7	And we went back
sd	B.54 utt8	and we talked to the person a second time and things like that,
sd	B.54 utt9	and then we get the computer home,
sd	B.54 utt10	my husband goes to pick it up last week
sd	B.54 utt11	and we couldn't go get it sooner because I just had the baby,
sd	B.54 utt12	and , you know, life's just a little bit complicated.
b	A.55 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.57 utt1	Uh huh .
sd	B.58 utt1	And, he goes and gets it, brings it home,
sd	B.58 utt2	first of all they're missing components of it like cables so you can't really test it out.
sd	B.58 utt3	And then second thing, we still can't put the boards in, because they have other things blocking where we need to do it.
ba	A.59 utt1	jeez .
sd	B.62 utt1	And see now we're dealing with having to bring it back again
sd	B.62 utt2	and they say they can, you know, do something different and change some connectors
sd	B.62 utt3	and we hope so,
sd	B.62 utt4	but it's a hassle.
aa	A.63 utt1	Yeah,
aa	A.63 utt2	it really is.
sv	B.64 utt1	you know, it's just this problem with sales people just not knowing what goes on.
aa	A.65 utt1	Right,
sv	A.65 utt2	and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction.
b	B.66 utt1	Right.
sv	A.67 utt1	I think that's the worst part.
sd	B.68 utt1	So, well, actually some things are pretty good with that because I put it on a gold credit card
sd	B.68 utt2	and I just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation,
sd(^q)	B.68 utt3	and they said, well, you don't have to pay for it yet.
qy^g	A.69 utt1	Now that's an advantage, isn't it?
ny	B.70 utt1	Yes.
sv	A.71 utt1	It really is.
sv	A.71 utt2	I think, there's a lot not to be said for credit
sv	A.71 utt3	but that's one thing to be said for credit.
sv	A.71 utt4	It, how , it gets you some muscle where you need it.
b	B.72 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.74 utt1	Right.
sv	A.75 utt1	And I think that's really important.
sd(^q)	B.76 utt1	Well, because these guys if they, give us a hard time we're going to say, you, look, you know,
^q	B.76 utt2	if you can't fix this to our satisfaction, we're just returning the computer.
b	A.77 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.79 utt1	That's right.
aa^r	A.79 utt2	That's right.
sd	B.80 utt2	I just tell the credit card company, don't pay the charge, even though they've already paid it.
aa	A.81 utt1	That's right.
aa	A.83 utt1	No .
sd	B.84 utt1	But they'll just, you know, undo the credit that they did to them.
aa	A.85 utt1	Yeah,
aa	A.85 utt2	they will,
aa	A.87 utt1	That's right.
aa	A.87 utt2	They will,
b	B.88 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.89 utt1	they will put the kind of clout on them that you can't really do.
b	B.90 utt1	Right.
b	A.91 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.93 utt2	Hal bought me, small, well, , little jam box kind of thing
sd	A.93 utt4	I have my ninety three year old mother living with us,
sd	A.93 utt5	and so she doesn't remember anything
sd	A.93 utt6	but to keep her entertained, music and some of these things do help.
b	B.94 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.95 utt1	And I thought well, if I had, a nice little, tape recorder, you know, so that I could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while. And then also so that I, I do some musicals and things like this and if I can copy sections off that I can use someplace I figured well this will be good.
b	B.96 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.97 utt1	Well, the first time I turned it on, I was recording,
sd	A.97 utt2	and the next thing I knew the tape was chewed up in the, thing.
ba	B.98 utt1	no.
sd	A.99 utt3	so after that then , you couldn't get a tape to play at the right speed in that side.
b	B.100 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.101 utt1	And then on the other side, when I, I loa , loaned it to my daughter the other day to take it over to, videotaping they were doing,
sd	A.101 utt2	and she says it's wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far,
sd	A.101 utt3	and so you can't get it to run the right way, either,
b	B.102 utt1	Uh huh.
qw	B.104 utt1	What brand is it?
qy	B.104 utt2	Do you know?
b	A.105 utt1	Yeah,
^h	A.105 utt2	so I wish I could tell you
ng	A.105 utt3	I really don't know which brand it is.
sd	B.106 utt1	But I was wondering like, you know
sd	B.106 utt2	in our case where we knew we were buying a copy
sd	B.106 utt3	we weren't buying, on I B M P C
b	A.107 utt1	Yeah.
qy^d	B.108 utt2	and I was wondering if you,
nn	A.109 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.109 utt2	I think this is maybe a name brand
sv	A.109 utt3	and I suspect that it's probably , just a fluke, you know.
sd	A.109 utt4	I have the papers and everything
sd	A.109 utt5	and we're going to just take it back
b	B.110 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	B.110 utt2	Do you buy it at some major store?
ny	A.111 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.111 utt2	just, one of the major, I think it was a, you know, I don't, I think it was, you know, like a Highlands or something like this.
b^m	B.112 utt1	Highlands ,
sd	B.112 utt2	chain down there that I don't know up here.
qy	A.113 utt1	Do they have Highlands up there?
nn	B.114 utt1	Nope.
bh	A.115 utt1	Don't they?
sd	A.115 utt2	Well, this is was a regular, electronics store, you know.
b	B.116 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.117 utt1	So, I don't think there will be too much problem
sd	A.117 utt2	but I guess I'm not sure whether I think things are not made as well.
sv	A.117 utt3	I think they deliberately sometimes,
sv	B.118 utt1	I think a lot of things are not made as well.
bh	A.119 utt1	Don't you?
qw	A.119 utt2	what, for instance, what are you,
sd	B.120 utt2	of course, it's hard to think of an exact example,
b	A.121 utt1	Yeah.
ba	A.123 utt1	That's good
b	B.126 utt1	yeah,
sd	B.126 utt2	well, I like electronic stuff, you know
b	A.127 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.128 utt2	for one thing. I know their, work, you know,
sv	B.128 utt3	cars I think are not made, as well as they could be.
aa	A.131 utt1	Yeah.
aa^r	A.131 utt2	Yeah,
aa	A.133 utt1	I think that's right.
sv	B.134 utt2	they want people to replace it after, a couple of years.
b	A.135 utt1	Right.
sv	A.137 utt1	The fact that they have competition with the Japanese and whatnot sometimes, dwells on a fact that, you know,
sd	A.137 utt2	I've known people who have had Toyotas for years that have had almost no repair work to do on them.
b	B.138 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.139 utt1	Well, they may cost a little more,
sv	A.139 utt2	but they don't have to take them to the shop every other day.
aa	B.140 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.140 utt2	I had a Toyota
sd	B.140 utt3	and I loved it.
b	A.141 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.142 utt1	My Toyota did, really well.
sv	A.143 utt1	It does the, it did a good job,
sv	A.145 utt2	so, part of it is that we need to develop more of a pride in, the kinds of things we do so we make them better.
ba	B.146 utt1	Good.
aa	B.146 utt2	Yeah.
sv	A.147 utt1	And it kind of has to start from the top and go clea , or from the bottom maybe and go clear up.
sv	B.148 utt1	Well, I think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship.
sv	B.148 utt2	The people just don't care about, what they're doing.
aa	A.149 utt1	No.
b	A.151 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.152 utt2	nobody cares, nobody's, really paying,
b	A.153 utt1	Yeah.
sv(^q)	A.155 utt1	Attitude is just get me my dollar so I can go do what I want to do, and, on,
aa	B.156 utt1	Right,
^q	B.156 utt2	give me my paycheck, so I can go home.
sv(^q)	A.157 utt1	what I'm doing, right.
sv	A.157 utt2	I think that's too bad.
sv	A.157 utt3	And it's a shame too because, when you get right down to it most things, if you do a good job, nobody can pay you enough .
sv	A.157 utt4	There isn't, any way to get paid enough.
b	B.158 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.159 utt2	But if you do a good job, you feel enough satisfaction,
sv	A.159 utt3	so whatever you're paid is enough.
aa	B.160 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.160 utt3	well, I do research
sd	B.160 utt4	and so I'm used to sort of being underpaid for whatever work gets done.
b	A.161 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.162 utt1	and you get satisfaction out of it.
aa	A.163 utt1	That's right,
sv	B.164 utt1	And, But you know, I think things come both from the, individual side and also from the company side
sv	A.165 utt1	I think they underestimate how much value the satisfaction
sv@	A.165 utt2	is. Yeah.
sv	B.166 utt2	because the companies that, give the attitude that, well, you know,
^q	B.166 utt3	you're the last one hired
^q	B.166 utt4	so you'll be the first one fired,
^q	B.168 utt1	and we just want you to do your days work,
b	A.169 utt1	Yeah.
^q	B.170 utt1	and we don't really care about you, as an individual.
b	A.171 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.172 utt2	When you've got that type of attitude on it, the people don't care, about their work.
aa	A.173 utt1	No .
sv	A.175 utt1	it probably basically goes right back into the home though unfortunately.
sv	A.175 utt2	Starts with the one person that, you know,
sv	A.175 utt3	and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand that there is value just in work for itself without any pay, you know.
sv	B.176 utt1	Little value just in whatever you do.
b	A.177 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.177 utt2	The, the, the that the value is in doing it well
sv	B.178 utt1	Doing a good job of it.
