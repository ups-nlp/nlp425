qo	A.1 utt1	Well, what do you think in terms of, benefits?
sv	B.2 utt2	of course I'm sure we're familiar with the exact same benefit package
sv	B.2 utt3	and I think that, we've probably got one of the best around, you know,
sv	B.2 utt4	besides, they tend to offer adequate vacation, I guess.
sv	B.2 utt5	And the paid time off is wonderful,
sd	B.2 utt6	and, one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the CODA Plan that is offered
sv	B.2 utt7	and I think that is just a fabulous one,
qy^d	B.2 utt8	so. I don't know if you participate in that or not,
ny	A.3 utt1	Absolutely.
qy	B.4 utt1	isn't it great?
sv	B.4 utt2	it's just a miracle how fast that adds up, you know.
aa	A.5 utt1	Well, I have to agree with that.
sd	A.5 utt2	You know, I was thinking about, importance of benefits and that kind of thing, other than salary while I was waiting for, the system to find a respondent.
b	B.6 utt1	Uh huh
b	B.8 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.9 utt1	And I started thinking that over the years that importance has changed
sv	A.9 utt2	and I suspect that that's probably true for everyone.
b	B.10 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.11 utt1	When I was much younger it was, less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits.
sd	A.11 utt2	But as I grow older and my family grows, the medical benefits are more important
sd	A.11 utt3	and the retirement is more important.
ba	B.12 utt1	I had never really thought of it that way
aa	B.12 utt2	but I guess that's true.
sd	B.12 utt3	I'm still young enough that, the vacation's real important to me
sd	B.12 utt4	and the paid time off is real important to me and that kind of thing.
sd	B.12 utt5	But, you know, as a matter of fact, I just, celebrated my fifth year at T I the end of last month and, kind of started looking through the book because of that, you know,
sd	B.12 utt6	now that I'm a hundred percent vested, you know, you kind of look through the book and see well, what does that mean and what is the pension all about
sd	B.12 utt8	I'm only in my late twenties now,
sd	B.12 utt9	so you tend not to think about retirement.
sd	B.12 utt11	I guess now is the time to think about it,
qy	B.12 utt12	so. Does T I have a pretty good retirement package, do you think?
na	A.13 utt1	I think they have, one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves.
b	B.14 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.15 utt1	And that's certainly one of the reasons that I'm sure that they've begun the, CODA Plan.
b	B.16 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.17 utt1	It's certainly a supplemental way,
b	B.18 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.19 utt2	and I suppose b , maybe in your instance, if you're started with T I in your early to mid twenties, and happen to stay with them until you're sixty five, then you'll have a very good retirement plan.
b	B.20 utt1	Right.
sd	A.21 utt1	But I had another career first and then came to T I a little later.
b	B.22 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.23 utt2	all by itself it won't be adequate for, for my situation.
sd	B.24 utt1	It's not going to build up, quite enough,
aa	B.26 utt2	yeah.
sd	A.27 utt1	So, I have to find a way to supplement that.
b	B.28 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.28 utt2	Well, they seem to make it so easy to save.
sd	B.28 utt4	but I've got money coming out to buy savings bonds, just coming straight out of my check.
sv	B.28 utt5	And it's probably not a great investment,
sd	B.28 utt6	but if I wasn't doing that the money wouldn't be being saved anyway, you know.
sd	B.28 utt7	I kind of have to trade off, you know.
sv	B.28 utt8	If you never see it you don't spend it,
ba	A.29 utt1	I understand though,
b	B.30 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.31 utt1	believe me, I do that myself.
bh	B.32 utt1	Do you?
bh	B.32 utt2	Yeah?
ar	A.33 utt1	And I disagree with you.
sd	A.33 utt2	I don't think it's the worst investment, in the world.
bh	B.34 utt1	Do you really not?
sd	B.36 utt1	I, you know, I, I debate about whether it's really good or not, you know.
sd	A.37 utt2	and maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed, until later.
b	B.38 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.40 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.41 utt1	it's shown a history that, sure beats anything else. Over many, many years.
aa	B.42 utt1	Yeah,
aa	B.42 utt2	that's true.
aa	B.42 utt3	That's very true.
sd	B.44 utt1	We went, and did a thing through I B S which is like a financial consultant type thing here in Dallas
sd	B.44 utt2	and, one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was, you know,
sd	B.44 utt3	they work up this whole big, you know, profile for you, all the things that you need to work on and you need to do.
sd	B.44 utt4	And then one of the things that we talked about with her was, you know, the need to save for our son's education.
sd	B.44 utt5	We have a two year old, you know,
sd	B.44 utt6	and, you know, we can't start saving for college when he's sixteen, you know,
sd	B.44 utt7	we have to do that now.
sd	B.44 utt8	and they have a way that they can figure, you know, what, you know,
sd	B.44 utt9	and he's two now,
sd	B.44 utt10	in sixteen years when he's ready to go to college, this is how much it'll cost, you know,
sd	B.44 utt11	and it's just really scary the thought of how much it's going to,
sd	B.44 utt12	what it costs now is ridiculous,
sd	B.44 utt13	what it's going to cost sixteen years from now is just really scary.
sd	B.44 utt14	And they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a, you know, six percent interest rate, to be able to have, you know, money for his college.
sd	B.44 utt15	And that's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds, is, you know, about fifteen hundred dollars a year.
sd	B.44 utt17	in that way, at least we know that that's taken care of, you know.
sd	B.44 utt18	we can worry about other things
ba	A.45 utt1	I understand, that approach.
b	B.46 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.47 utt2	That's, what, that's exactly what's happening in my family.
b	B.48 utt1	Yeah,
bh	B.50 utt1	Is it really?
b	B.50 utt2	Yeah.
sd	A.51 utt1	except that mine are a little bit older
sd(^q)	A.51 utt2	and I've shown them the numbers and said this is what's going to be available,
^q	A.51 utt3	all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there.
b	B.52 utt1	Uh huh.
^q	A.53 utt1	You better make sure that you've got a scholarship.
aa	B.54 utt1	That's right.
aa	B.56 utt1	That's right.
sd	B.56 utt2	Well, that's what she said to us.
sd(^q)	B.56 utt3	She said, now, do you all want him to go to a state college or a private college?
sd	B.56 utt4	and our answer was, that, you know, we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college.
sd	B.56 utt5	And if he wants to go to a private college, he can get a scholarship to attend, you know.
sd	B.56 utt6	And that was kind of our view on it.
sv	B.56 utt7	It just costs too much,
sv	B.56 utt8	you just can't do it, you know.
h	B.56 utt9	So, I don't know,
sd	B.56 utt13	it amazes me how much the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years.
sv	B.56 utt14	I just don't know how anybody's going to do it.
sd	A.57 utt2	And boy, it gets really scary when you start talking to them.
sd(^q)	A.57 utt3	I have an eleven year old daughter now who's saying, gee, Dad, I want to be an allergist,
ba	B.58 utt1	goodness.
sd(^q)	A.59 utt1	and I said, that's wonderful.
^q	A.59 utt2	I applaud that.
^q	A.59 utt3	Let, me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that.
b	B.60 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.62 utt1	Yeah.
ba	B.62 utt2	Exactly.
sd	A.63 utt1	And, then } her little brother's only two years behind
ba	B.64 utt1	Exactly.
sd(^q)	A.65 utt2	and he says, well, I don't know,
^q	A.65 utt3	I think that I probably want to be a veterinarian.
sd(^q)	A.65 utt4	And I said, that's great.
^q	A.65 utt5	Let me explain to you how you get scholarships , to do that.
aa	B.66 utt1	That's right,
aa	B.68 utt1	That's right .
sv	B.68 utt2	Well, you know, you know, T I offers some good stuff
sv	B.68 utt3	and then I mean I think there's some negatives,
sv	B.68 utt4	but there's going to be some negatives anywhere, you know, no matter where you go.
sd	B.68 utt6	this is the first really large company I've worked for. I've
sd	B.68 utt7	always been involved in little small, you know, privately owned firms
sd	B.68 utt8	and so I've never had the big benefit package.
sd	B.68 utt9	So, I really don't know how to compare it to other big companies, you know.
sd	B.68 utt10	when I came on it was great because I had never had anything even close to what they offered.
sd	B.68 utt11	So, I've been real pleased.
ba	A.69 utt1	Well, that's fantastic,
b	B.70 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.71 utt1	and on whole I would say that they're equal to, most of our competitors.
bh	B.72 utt1	Think so?
sv	A.73 utt1	I can see some potential changes that probably are, would not cost very much but might, make things a little easier. Such as offering a smorgasbord. Having a larger variety of benefits
b	B.74 utt1	Uh huh.
sv(^q)	A.75 utt2	but, but here's the amount, that T I is going to pay for it,
b	B.76 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.78 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.78 utt2	and you can pick what you want
aa	B.78 utt3	and, yeah.
ad	A.79 utt1	now it's up to you
sv	A.79 utt2	it's menu selection, so, to speak.
b	B.80 utt1	Right.
ba	B.82 utt1	That sounds really good.
sd	B.82 utt2	I read a thing,
sd	B.82 utt3	I don't even remember if it was in the DALLASITE or the INSITE one, about companies allowing you,
sd	B.82 utt4	and they said that T I was looking into it, to purchase extra vacation days. Which I thought sounded like a good idea.
sd	B.82 utt5	You know, if you've been there, you know, under five years you get two weeks of vacation
sv	B.82 utt6	but that's really not enough
sd	B.82 utt7	and you want an extra week, then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying, okay, I'm going to want an extra five days this year
sd	B.82 utt8	and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck, you know,
sd	B.82 utt9	and they're deducting it all along,
sd	B.82 utt10	so you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time, you know,
sd	B.82 utt11	you're really not being paid for them,
sd	B.82 utt12	the money is actually coming out of your own pocket,
sd	B.82 utt13	but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once, you know.
sd	B.82 utt14	So, that is kind of an idea that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in
sd	B.82 utt15	and T I said that they were looking into something like that
sv	A.83 utt1	Well, I could certainly, personally stand seeing them go to a standardized compensatory time for overtime.
b	B.84 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.86 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.87 utt1	And I don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days, if they did, that.
aa	B.90 utt1	true.
aa	B.92 utt1	True.
sv	A.93 utt1	and I would certainly support something like four to one or five to one
sv	A.93 utt2	or, you know, maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one. as a repayment for, every three to five days that I work overtime there, they should give me one day.
b	B.94 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.96 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.98 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.100 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.101 utt1	But it should be a standard and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate that's running in each department.
b	B.102 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.102 utt4	and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person
sd	B.102 utt5	and, you know, I see a lot of differences, from one group to the next, you know, about who gets it and who doesn't get it, you know.
sd	B.102 utt6	and that's that way with a lot of things, you know, there.
sv	B.102 utt7	It seems like, it depends on what group you happen to be in, what you're going to get and what you're not going to get
aa	A.103 utt1	Well, that's for sure.
sv	B.104 utt1	Which is the same,
sv	B.104 utt2	but then it's probably that way anywhere, you know,
sv	A.105 utt1	I'm sure personalities always come into play.
b	B.106 utt1	Uh huh.
