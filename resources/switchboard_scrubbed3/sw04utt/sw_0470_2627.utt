b	A.2 utt1	Okay,
qy	A.2 utt2	so do you do a lot of cooking in your family?
ng	B.3 utt1	I do some every now and then,
sd	B.3 utt2	I work
sd	B.3 utt3	and my wife's home during the day
sd	B.3 utt4	so she usually ends up doing most of it.
b	A.4 utt1	yeah.
sd	B.5 utt1	When I was single we used to always cook, around the house.
b	A.6 utt1	Yeah,
qy	A.6 utt2	do you like to cook.
ny	B.7 utt1	yeah,
sd^e	B.7 utt2	I really like it,
b	A.8 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.8 utt2	yeah.
sd	B.9 utt2	like, I grew up with you know, having Polish and Ukrainian food.
b	A.10 utt1	really.
sd	B.11 utt1	And my wife, she likes Italian and stuff,
b	A.12 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.13 utt1	so we definitely have different tastes,
b	A.14 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.14 utt2	yeah,
sv	A.14 utt3	but that's neat though, because you get to have different stuff .
b	B.15 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.16 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.16 utt2	I'm a pretty bad cook .
sd	A.16 utt3	I'm pretty bad.
sd	A.16 utt4	My husband is really good,
sd	A.16 utt5	he put himself through college working in restaurants.
ba	B.17 utt1	wow.
sd	A.18 utt1	And, he's much better cook than I am,
sd	A.18 utt2	so, when I was home I still cooked a lot
sd	A.18 utt3	and I was in to a lot of vegetarian stuff.
sd	A.18 utt4	And now, I went back to work about a year and a half ago
sd	A.18 utt5	so, one of the things that he took over was the cooking
sd	A.18 utt6	and the kids are thrilled,
sd	A.18 utt7	they're really happy, that I don't cook anymore.
qy^g	B.19 utt1	they're like, preferring it now, right .
ny	A.20 utt1	Yeah,
sd(^q)	A.20 utt2	they say oh dad, let dad cook mom,
^q	A.20 utt3	let him do it
qy^d	A.20 utt5	You obviously have one.
ny	B.21 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.21 utt2	two,
ny	B.21 utt3	uh huh.
bk	A.22 utt1	Okay,
bf	A.22 utt2	you have two.
aa	B.23 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.23 utt2	one is, nine months
sd	B.23 utt3	and the other is two and a half.
b^m	A.24 utt1	Two and half,
b	B.25 utt1	Yeah,
qy^g	A.26 utt1	I was just going to say, makes a difference in what you eat doesn't it .
qrr	A.26 utt2	Or are you not at that stage yet?
ny	B.27 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.27 utt2	it does .
b	A.28 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.29 utt1	We try our hardest to get them to eat what we, eat, you know.
b	A.30 utt1	Right.
sd	B.31 utt1	And my sister, she's the master of the fast order grill, you know,
b	A.32 utt1	yeah.
sd	B.33 utt1	she makes six different meals,
ba	A.34 utt1	my gosh.
sd	B.35 utt1	Like to have one thing, you know,
sd	B.35 utt2	one likes chicken nuggets, the other one like hot dogs,
ba	A.36 utt1	my gosh,
sd	A.36 utt2	I couldn't .
sd	B.37 utt1	and then she makes noodles with, soy sauce or whatever,
b	A.38 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.40 utt1	Boy, I couldn't do that,
b	B.41 utt1	But, yeah,
^h	B.41 utt3	let me think,
sd	B.41 utt4	I was thinking of the one recipe that we made.
sd	B.41 utt5	I guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy,
sd	B.41 utt6	and that was, scallop,
qw	A.42 utt1	What's that.
b	A.44 utt1	really.
sd	B.45 utt1	it has a French name,
sd	B.45 utt2	it basically means that it has a Swiss cheese, cream sauce with it
sd	B.45 utt3	and you pour it over rice,
b	A.46 utt1	yeah,
qy	A.46 utt2	what is that, Saint Jack or something.
ny	B.47 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.48 utt1	Scallops Saint something,
b	B.49 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.49 utt2	I can't even remember what the recipe's name is anymore,
b	A.50 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.50 utt2	yeah.
sd	B.51 utt1	but, it was basically just ground up Swiss cheese and then, standard cream sauce base and then, the scallops.
b	A.52 utt1	Really,
^2	A.52 utt2	with scallops.
sv	B.53 utt2	and it sounds sort of funny
sd	B.53 utt3	but it tastes really good.
ar	A.54 utt1	No,
ar^r	A.54 utt2	no,
sd	A.54 utt3	I'm from New England,
sd	A.54 utt4	so we had, a lot of seafood before we moved down here.
sv	A.56 utt1	And, that sounds delicious to me.
b	B.57 utt1	Yeah.
ba	A.58 utt1	That sounds great.
b	B.59 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.60 utt1	we're just thinking of having, a, dinner party.
sd	A.60 utt2	We went to this dinner party the other night that was kind of like a game,
sd	A.60 utt3	they had, a murder mystery,
b	B.61 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.62 utt1	and you came dressed as one of the characters
sd	A.62 utt2	and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner,
b	B.63 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.64 utt1	and it was really fun
sd	A.64 utt2	and so we were thinking we wanted to do, you know, we were going to try doing it ourselves,
sd	A.64 utt3	but we're trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around trying to get stuff ready for the table
sd	A.64 utt4	and that kind of interrupted the game,
sd	A.64 utt5	so, so I was thinking there's this Beef Bourguignonne recipe that I've tried before that's pretty good
b	B.65 utt1	Right,
b	B.65 utt2	yeah.
sd	A.66 utt2	and then you can make that ahead
sd	A.66 utt3	and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready.
b	B.67 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.69 utt1	Yeah
sd	B.69 utt2	that's another thing
sd	B.69 utt3	I have a problem with my wife,
b	A.70 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.71 utt1	she likes to, she doesn't like the beef dishes.
sd	B.71 utt2	She likes the chicken and fish,
b	A.72 utt1	yeah.
sd	B.73 utt1	and, like I said, we always ate beef and, pork, you know, a lot,
b	A.74 utt1	yeah.
ba	A.76 utt1	I know,
sd	A.76 utt2	my husband did too .
sd	A.76 utt3	His parents are Austrian
sd	A.76 utt4	and they, always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table .
b	B.77 utt1	yeah,
sv	B.77 utt2	red meat, plenty of good red meat.
aa	A.78 utt1	Yeah,
aa^r	A.78 utt2	yeah,
aa^r	A.78 utt3	yeah.
sd	B.79 utt1	My dad could eat, a meal with out any vegetables at all.
ba	A.80 utt1	my gosh.
sd	B.81 utt1	And, Susan's, you know, they had, you know meatless meals, you know.
b	A.82 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.82 utt2	yeah.
sd	B.83 utt1	My dad wouldn't know what to do.
ba	A.84 utt1	gosh,
sd	B.85 utt1	Course, she grew up Catholic
sv	B.87 utt2	there's a certain amount of meatless meals you have to have .
aa	A.88 utt1	That you do,
aa	A.88 utt2	right,
aa	A.88 utt3	right,
sv	A.88 utt4	that's just part of it.
b	B.89 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.90 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.90 utt2	my family didn't,
sd	A.90 utt3	but when I got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that,
sd	A.90 utt4	but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly,
b	B.91 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.92 utt1	There was dishes that he really enjoyed, eating.
b	B.93 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.94 utt1	there were several things that he liked
sd	A.94 utt2	but it never was really, something that he would have chosen.
sd	A.94 utt3	It's just that I cooked
sd	A.94 utt4	so he had to put up with it .
b	B.95 utt1	Right.
sd	A.96 utt1	but there was one thing that he couldn't stand
sd	A.96 utt2	and that was soybeans.
sd	A.96 utt3	I tried it like once or twice
sd	A.96 utt4	and he just could not eat it,
sd	A.96 utt7	I was limited.
sd	A.96 utt8	I had to make vegetarian meals without using soy beans,
b	B.97 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.97 utt2	it's hard to get a protein content up then .
aa	A.98 utt1	Yeah,
aa^r	A.98 utt2	yeah.
aa	A.98 utt3	That's true .
b	B.99 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.99 utt2	I like them every now and then for a change,
sv	B.99 utt3	it's nice.
aa	A.100 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.100 utt2	some of the stuff is good,
sd	A.100 utt3	but it was a tremendous amount of cooking .
sv	A.100 utt4	Because you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete,
b	B.101 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.102 utt1	and we had little kids at the time, you know,
sd	A.102 utt2	when I was home with them, and it was just so much cooking,
sd	A.102 utt3	I don't like to cook.
sd	A.104 utt1	And I'm not really that great at it
sd	A.104 utt2	so it just turned out to be too much, too much cooking.
ad	A.104 utt3	So, well, I guess I'll let you get back to feeding your little one there.
ar	B.105 utt1	No,
sd	B.105 utt2	he's all done.
qy^d	A.106 utt1	He's set,
ny	B.107 utt1	Yeah,
ny^r	B.107 utt2	yeah,
sd^e	B.107 utt3	I set him down.
bk	A.108 utt1	Okay.
qy	A.108 utt2	Do you like to bake at all,
qrr	A.108 utt3	or do you get into that,
ny	B.109 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.109 utt2	we used to do that,
sd	B.109 utt3	my mom, used to go crazy, every Sunday, until my dad like blew up, you know .
b	A.110 utt1	Yeah .
sd	B.111 utt1	after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the Navy, she stopped doing it.
sd	B.113 utt1	But, she used to have, you know, two dozen sticky buns, three bread rolls, you know, every week.
b	A.114 utt1	Really,
b	A.114 utt2	no kidding.
sd	B.115 utt1	And, the sticky buns, of course, would last, you know three or four days
sd	B.115 utt2	and that would be it.
b	A.116 utt1	Yeah,
b	A.116 utt2	then be gone.
ba	A.116 utt3	I know,
sv	A.116 utt4	that's the thing about baking.
sd	A.116 utt5	I, I don't mind baking at all
sd	A.116 utt6	and I can do a pretty good pie,
sd	A.116 utt7	we have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother
sd	A.116 utt8	and my mother taught me how to make it.
b	B.117 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.118 utt1	I can make a pretty mean pie,
sv	A.118 utt2	but, I don't do it anymore because it's just too fattening.
sd	A.118 utt3	We had the same kind of problem.
sv	A.118 utt4	If you make homemade bread,
b	B.119 utt1	Uh huh .
sv	A.120 utt1	I mean, it's supposed to save you money
sv	A.120 utt2	but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat .
sv	A.120 utt3	It tastes so good.
aa	B.121 utt1	Uh huh,
sd	B.121 utt2	we had that bread that was,
qy	B.121 utt3	you ever seen the starter bread,
sd	B.121 utt4	I can't remember what it's called,
sd	B.121 utt5	they call it the, Amish bread here
ny	A.122 utt1	yeah.
sd	B.123 utt2	you just leave it out,
b	A.124 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.125 utt1	you know, and you let it spoil sort of.
ny	A.126 utt1	Yeah,
ny	A.126 utt2	uh huh,
sd^e	A.126 utt3	I've heard of it,
sd	A.126 utt4	but I've never done it.
b	B.127 utt1	You know, yeah.
ba	A.128 utt1	That sounds pretty good.
aa	B.129 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.129 utt2	it tasted pretty good, really.
b	A.130 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.130 utt2	yeah.
sd	B.131 utt1	But, it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad
sd	B.131 utt2	and then you add all these other ingredients to it,
b	A.132 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.132 utt2	and then you make the bread
sd	A.132 utt3	but you pinch off a portion, or save a portion of it for the next time, or something.
b	B.133 utt1	Yeah
b	B.133 utt2	right,
sd	B.133 utt3	you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else
sd	B.133 utt4	and that's how they continue the thing.
b	A.134 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.134 utt2	yeah,
b^r	A.134 utt3	yeah.
qh	A.134 utt5	I don't know how safe that was .
aa	B.135 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.135 utt2	I know it sounded strange to me too,
sv(^q)	B.135 utt3	I figure, well you're baking it
aa	A.136 utt1	Yeah
aa	A.136 utt2	that's true,
sv	A.136 utt3	that's got to kill anything I guess,
b	B.137 utt1	Okay,
fc	B.137 utt2	well, I'll talk to you later.
fc	A.138 utt1	All right,
fc	A.138 utt2	well, yeah

fc	A.150 utt1	Yeah,
fc^r	A.150 utt2	yeah.
fc	B.151 utt1	I think that's why they call me because they want to get people outside the state, you know.
fc	A.152 utt1	Yes
fc	A.152 utt2	they're trying to get all different amount of people.
fc	A.152 utt3	Well gee, my husband is from Richmond
fc	A.152 utt4	and I went to U V A,

fc	B.161 utt1	Yeah,
fc	B.161 utt2	it's sort of funny,
fc	B.161 utt3	I have people that want to go to Dallas.
fc	A.162 utt1	really.
fc	B.163 utt1	Yeah,
fc	B.163 utt2	one of my friends here, he was just talking how he's thinking of leaving the company and going to Dallas,
fc	A.164 utt1	yeah,
fc	A.164 utt2	no kidding.
fc	A.164 utt3	Well, things are doing pretty good down here,
fc	A.164 utt4	we were, we tried to move over to Raleigh last year
fc	A.164 utt5	and there was such little going on in Raleigh, you know,
fc	A.164 utt6	you couldn't get a job to save yourself over there
fc	A.164 utt7	so we decided we'll try in a couple of years,
fc	B.165 utt1	Yeah,
fc^r	B.165 utt2	yeah.
fc	B.165 utt3	We were saying we could sell our house here and buy one down there cash, you know.
fc	A.166 utt1	Yeah,
