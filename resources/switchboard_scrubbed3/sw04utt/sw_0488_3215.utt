sv^t	A.1 utt1	Well this is a subject that you never think you'll be assigned to . One that kind of comes up when you've lost the others, other subjects.
aa	B.2 utt1	No .
sd(^q)	A.3 utt2	as I was sitting there, I thought, the weather's been perfect.
sd	A.3 utt3	I don't know much to say about it.
sv	A.3 utt5	for the balloon festival here in Plano it was just gorgeous.
sd	B.4 utt1	I'm from Plano also.
bh	A.5 utt1	Are you?
sv	A.5 utt2	It couldn't have been better.
aa	B.6 utt1	That's right.
sd	A.7 utt1	I mean, it didn't foul one launch,
sv	A.7 utt2	and that's kind of unusual,
sv	A.7 utt3	and it's kind of cold in the mornings
sv	A.7 utt4	so you dress up warm,
b	B.8 utt1	Right.
sd	A.9 utt1	That's the only thing wrong I can find with it.
sd	B.10 utt1	I just got back from Dayton.
sd	B.10 utt2	I spent the weekend in Ohio with my family
ba	A.11 utt1	how fun.
sd	B.12 utt1	and the trees are changing color there.
sd	A.13 utt1	I miss that,
sd	B.14 utt2	as soon as we got out of the cloud cover.
sd	B.14 utt3	Of course it wasn't sunny like it is here.
sd	B.14 utt4	It was real gray
b	A.15 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.16 utt1	but as soon as the plane got through the clouds
sd	B.16 utt2	and I saw all those trees,
sd	B.16 utt3	it just really made me realize how much I miss the fall.
b	A.17 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.18 utt1	I don't complain weather wise though, because it was also thirty five degrees there yesterday morning,
sd	B.20 utt1	and the high was only fifty,
sd	B.20 utt2	and it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon
b	A.21 utt1	Ooh.
sd	B.22 utt1	so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies.
sv	A.23 utt1	I guess you have to take some things and leave some things.
aa	B.24 utt1	That's right.
b	A.25 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.25 utt2	I'm from Utah area,
sd	A.25 utt3	and you know, they have tons of canyons where the leaves change
sd	A.25 utt4	and they're gorgeous
b	B.26 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.27 utt1	you could spend every weekend of the fall going to a different area.
sd	B.28 utt1	We did that when we lived up in Michigan.
sd	B.28 utt2	We went up to the upper peninsula,
sd	B.28 utt3	and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure.
sd	B.30 utt1	And then on leaf weekends which is this time of the year, it's bumper to bumper traffic,
sd	B.30 utt3	whoever was driving could never have a prayer of looking at the leaves, because they had to keep watching the road.
aa	A.31 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.31 utt2	it's kind of hazardous for driving
aa	B.32 utt1	Yes.
ba	A.33 utt1	that's for sure.
sd	A.33 utt2	But I can't complain.
sd	A.33 utt3	I don't know if I've been spoiled.
sv	A.33 utt4	I've been thinking it's getting cold sooner than normal.
sd	A.33 utt5	We've only lived here a couple of years.
aa	B.34 utt1	I think it is,
sd	B.34 utt2	and my family said that in Ohio there was just an article on, at the T V news that they are three weeks ahead of schedule as far as the coldness of the temperatures and, the first frost,
sd	B.36 utt2	everything just happened three weeks early this year.
sv	A.37 utt1	We'll have to see how it goes,
sv	A.37 utt2	a couple of weeks ago we were cooler than normal,
sv	A.37 utt3	but then we're back to being warmer than normal this week, or last week,
sv	B.38 utt1	Just so we don't have one of those famous ice storms in the spring.
sd	A.41 utt1	I don't have to live through any of those really,
qy^d	A.41 utt3	I mean, nothing comparable, I guess, to what you've had before.
nd	B.42 utt1	Well, I've only been here just a short time, too,
sd	B.42 utt2	so I haven't been through any of those either,
sd	B.44 utt2	so. I have in Michigan,
sd	B.44 utt3	but in Michigan you can get twelve inches of snow
sd	B.44 utt4	and life goes on.
aa	A.45 utt1	You're right.
sd	B.46 utt1	So, as I understand it here, if there's anything, they'll call off schools and close businesses.
sd	A.47 utt1	Well, they get ice,
sd	A.47 utt2	and no one can drive on ice.
b	B.48 utt1	Right.
sd	A.49 utt1	I mean, we used to think they were pansies,
sv	A.49 utt2	but then when you decided what ice was .
aa	B.50 utt1	Right,
aa	B.50 utt2	the real definition of ice .
fc	A.51 utt1	So, well, I think we've discussed it good enough today.
fc	B.52 utt1	I think so.
fc	A.53 utt1	It was, It was good talking to you.
fc	B.54 utt1	It was nice talking with you.
fc	A.55 utt2	Maybe we'll get the next time.
fc	B.56 utt1	Okay.
fc	A.57 utt1	Take care.
fc	B.58 utt1	Okay.
fc	A.59 utt1	Bye bye.
fc	B.60 utt1	Bye.
