sv	A.1 utt1	Well, what I believe is one of the major things that is wrong with our public school system is that, we do not have enough discipline
b	B.2 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.3 utt1	and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now.
b	B.4 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	B.6 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	B.6 utt2	I agree with that.
sd	A.7 utt1	when I went to school, I know I was scared to death about being disciplined,
bh	B.8 utt1	You were?
sd	A.9 utt2	and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different.
b	B.10 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.12 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.13 utt1	You know, you did not see, I did not see anybody in my classrooms, when I was going to school, act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom.
b	B.14 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.16 utt1	Yeah,
aa	B.16 utt2	yeah.
sv	B.16 utt3	From what I understand, they act up pretty bad .
aa	A.17 utt1	Yeah,
aa	A.17 utt2	that's right,
aa^r	A.17 utt3	that's right.
qw	B.18 utt1	What, grade is your daughter in?
sd	A.19 utt1	my daughter's in the, fourth grade
b	B.20 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	B.20 utt2	uh huh.
sd	A.21 utt1	and, there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom, where the teacher cannot teach
b	B.22 utt1	Uh huh,
b	B.22 utt2	uh huh.
b	B.24 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.25 utt1	and when I went to school that just wasn't put up with.
aa	B.26 utt1	no,
aa	B.26 utt2	uh huh.
sd	B.26 utt3	They always had a paddle in our school.
b	A.27 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.29 utt1	Well, they just don't do that any more.
aa	B.30 utt1	I know.
sv	A.31 utt1	But the school system's afraid of getting sued and, all sorts of lawsuits I'm sure because of things like that.
b	B.32 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	B.34 utt1	Yeah,
aa^r	B.34 utt2	yeah.
sv	A.35 utt1	And, I also believe even though I feel like I pay a good share towards the school system, that the teachers are still underpaid
sv	A.35 utt2	and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school.
aa	B.36 utt1	Uh huh,
aa^r	B.36 utt2	uh huh.
aa	B.38 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.39 utt1	And, I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.
aa	B.40 utt1	Yeah.
qy	B.40 utt2	Wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for, if we approve it?
ny	A.41 utt1	Yes
sd^e	A.43 utt1	supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for,
sv	A.43 utt2	and you know, we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not.
b	B.44 utt1	Uh huh.
qw^d	A.47 utt1	You know, I don't know your feelings toward that.
ad	A.47 utt2	I guess we shouldn't get into that
^h	A.47 utt3	but, and what else,
sv	A.49 utt2	I think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire.
b	B.50 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.51 utt1	I have heard stories, from other parents that I know of, their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs,
b	B.52 utt1	Uh huh.
ar	B.54 utt1	No.
bh	B.54 utt2	Really?
ny	A.55 utt1	yeah,
sd	A.57 utt1	I've heard some horrible stories about high school teachers
b	B.58 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.59 utt1	and, you know, to be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school.
b	B.60 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.61 utt1	that's basically about all that I know that may be wrong with the school system.
sv	A.63 utt1	with what they have to work with, I think they're doing a pretty good job right now.
aa	B.64 utt1	I do too,
aa^m	B.64 utt2	I think they're doing real good job.
b	A.65 utt1	Uh huh,
qh	B.66 utt1	But, then, what do I know,
qy@	A.67 utt1	You don't have any children in school? Don't have any kids.
ng	B.68 utt1	I don't have any kids.
