o	A.1 utt1	Okay,
sd	A.1 utt2	I'm here.
qo	A.1 utt3	How do you feel about public schools?
sv	B.2 utt1	Well, our public schools are really poor, I feel.
b	A.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.4 utt1	I'm not sure where Georgia ranks in the nation
sd	B.4 utt2	but, we're toward the bottom.
b	A.5 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.6 utt1	And, there's a lot of things that I see that are so obviously wrong. That you would think it would be easy to correct.
b	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.9 utt1	Right.
sv	B.10 utt1	But the system doesn't allow for the corrections .
b	A.11 utt1	Uh huh.
qo	B.12 utt1	How about you?
sv	A.13 utt1	Well, that's interesting.
sd	A.13 utt2	I have a sister who used to live in Kennesaw, Georgia.
bk	B.14 utt1	yes.
sd	A.15 utt1	And, she has a young boy. Actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there.
sd	A.15 utt2	And she complained quite a bit about their school system there.
b	B.16 utt1	Yes.
sd	B.18 utt1	And Cobb County is better than the county I'm in.
b	A.19 utt1	Right.
sd	B.20 utt1	She was in Cobb County.
aa	A.21 utt1	Right.
sd	A.21 utt3	I can't really say much about the schools up here.
sd	A.21 utt4	I really don't come from here
b	B.22 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.23 utt1	I'm only up here temporarily on an internship
sd	A.23 utt2	but I live in Orlando, Florida usually.
b	B.24 utt1	Okay.
sd	A.25 utt2	And the schools down there, from what I know, are not bad.
sd	A.25 utt3	They're pretty good.
ba	B.26 utt1	Well, that's great.
sd	A.27 utt1	But I know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good.
b	B.28 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.29 utt1	For example, I have a brother in North Carolina
sd	A.29 utt2	and he says the schools there are just terrible.
sv	B.30 utt1	Well, I feel that we're way behind.
sd	B.30 utt2	I have a son that is in the fourth grade
sd	B.32 utt1	and, they have just now taken up division.
ba	A.33 utt1	Wow.
aa	B.34 utt1	Yeah .
sd	A.35 utt1	That is slow.
sd	B.36 utt3	my husband and I go to the store
sd	B.36 utt4	and we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication, division things
sd	B.36 utt5	and I feel like, there are several areas that we're just really, really slow in.
b	A.37 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.38 utt1	And, I don't blame the teachers as much as I blame the system.
qo	A.39 utt1	What do you think's wrong to cause that?
sv	B.40 utt1	well, for one thing there's not enough money in the school system.
sv	B.40 utt2	And the money they do have, they do not use it wisely.
b	A.41 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.42 utt1	my son's teacher has twenty seven students.
b	A.43 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.44 utt1	And that's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal with on an every day basis.
b	A.45 utt1	Yeah.
am	A.47 utt1	Perhaps.
sv	B.48 utt1	but more than that, I don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children.
b	A.49 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.50 utt1	And when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps the class in an uproar and you're not at liberty to do something about it, other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office. It it, you know, it can, it can really be bad.
b	A.51 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.53 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.53 utt2	that's one thing I worry about .
sv	B.54 utt2	also I think, we have a lot of, Hispanics
aa	A.55 utt1	There you go,
b	A.55 utt2	uh huh.
sd	B.56 utt2	the county I'm in, the minorities are mostly Hispanic.
b	A.57 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.57 utt2	Probably quite a few black people up there
ar	B.58 utt1	No .
sd	B.58 utt2	we're from the county they marched in.
sd	B.58 utt3	We're in Forsyth county
bh	A.59 utt1	is that right?
ny	B.60 utt1	yes,
sd	B.60 utt3	and there's very few blacks.
bk	A.61 utt1	okay.
sd	B.62 utt2	I hate to say,
sv	B.62 utt3	it's not a problem, because I hate to feel like they are a problem, although they are.
aa	A.63 utt1	Yeah
sv	A.63 utt3	you don't want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever,
sv	A.63 utt4	but then again.
sv	B.64 utt1	But it is a problem . especially in the inner city.
aa	A.65 utt1	Yeah,
aa	A.65 utt2	there is no denying that,
ba	A.67 utt1	Sure, you know.
sv	A.67 utt2	you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand, especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school.
nd	B.68 utt1	Well,
sv	B.68 utt2	and you can't put all the children in special education.
aa	A.69 utt1	That's right,
sv	A.69 utt2	you can't do that.
sv	B.70 utt1	and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done you know.
b	A.71 utt1	Right.
sd	A.73 utt1	See, I grew up in Nebraska
b	B.74 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.75 utt1	and the school that I went to there was fantastic.
sd	A.75 utt3	I really consider myself very lucky.
sd	A.75 utt4	we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking, twenty seven, thirty kids to a class.
b	B.76 utt1	Yeah.
bf	B.78 utt1	But your teacher had control.
aa	A.79 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.79 utt2	We zipped right along, you know.
sd	A.79 utt3	I, I was, I was doing mathematics, fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade, easily.
b	B.80 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	B.82 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.82 utt2	I believe I was too.
b	A.85 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	A.85 utt2	But, you're right, you know.
sv	A.85 utt3	With all this, don't hurt the kids and don't abuse their rights, you've also taken something away from the discipline, I think.
b	B.86 utt1	Uh huh .
sd	B.88 utt1	well, it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it, my son would be in private school.
b	A.89 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.90 utt1	We just cannot afford it.
b	A.91 utt1	Right.
qy^d	A.91 utt2	I was going to ask you if that was an option.
