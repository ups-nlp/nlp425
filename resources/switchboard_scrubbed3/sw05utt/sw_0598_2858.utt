o	A.1 utt1	Okay,
qw	A.1 utt2	what do you think are some current trends in, the way families spend time together, based on what you've seen.
sv	B.2 utt1	I think that it's getting to where they're not spending time together.
b	A.3 utt1	Yeah .
sv	B.4 utt1	I think, like in my situation, today, on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together, my husband's been off doing his thing all day today,
sd	B.4 utt2	and I've been off doing my thing all day
sd	B.4 utt3	and I haven't seen him since eight o'clock this morning.
ba	A.5 utt1	Really.
qy	A.7 utt1	Are you newly married,
qr	A.7 utt2	or,
sd	B.8 utt1	two years.
b	A.9 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.9 utt2	same situation here, I've been married about ten months,
sd	A.9 utt4	I can, I know what you mean.
sv	B.10 utt1	it's really hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and, you both have hobbies that are different.
b	A.11 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.12 utt1	you know, if you have hobbies that are the same, then, you know, you can enjoy your hobby together,
sd	B.12 utt2	but my husband and I have different hobbies.
qy	A.13 utt1	Is he a hunter and a fisher and all that.
nn	B.14 utt1	No,
nn^r	B.14 utt2	no,
sd^e	B.14 utt3	he's a record collector and a Hot Wheels collector.
sd	B.16 utt1	so he was off today, looking at records.
b	A.17 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.18 utt1	and I was off, you know, doing, you know, household type things. You know, laundry
b	A.19 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.20 utt2	and, did some shopping and stuff.
sd	A.21 utt1	from the people I've talked to, I don't know if I should bring this into it,
sd	A.21 utt2	but, a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers where they could manage their own schedule
sd	A.21 utt3	and, they could spend more time with their kids
b	B.22 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.23 utt2	because they look back
sd	A.23 utt3	and, you know, they're all like, kind of regretful, I think.
b	B.24 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.24 utt2	I think, I think that would be the ideal situation,
sv	B.26 utt1	I think that would be the ideal situation.
sd	B.26 utt3	like in my case I do shift work.
b	A.27 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.28 utt1	I don't have that choice.
aa	A.29 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.29 utt2	same here.
sd	B.30 utt1	I have to be at work at X hour, you know, at, at a certain hour
sd	B.30 utt2	and it's not flexible.
b	A.31 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.32 utt1	it would be nice to be able to have flexible hours
sd	B.32 utt2	and maybe after we decide to have kids I might find a job that has flexible hours.
sd	B.32 utt3	I hope so anyway.
h	B.32 utt4	but I don't know.
qy	A.33 utt1	At T I, is that where you work?
ny	B.34 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.35 utt1	It's really kind of sad,
sd	A.35 utt2	some of the people that I work with like when I worked on second shift, their paren , their kids go to school during the day
sd	A.35 utt3	and then they wouldn't see them at night, because they would be you know, at work and the kids are all ready in bed.
b	B.36 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.37 utt2	And so it was kind of like, they see their kids for fifteen minutes and the same with their spouses.
sd	A.37 utt3	This relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends, or something, you know.
b	B.38 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.39 utt1	So it was really sad, you know that a lot of families, well, you know, have to have dual income.
sv	A.39 utt2	A lot of people choose to, which is fine.
b	B.40 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.41 utt1	But, you know, then the kids kind of suffer.
b	B.42 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.42 utt2	ideally, it wo , it would be nice to be able to just have, like, back in the old days, you know, back like when I grew up, you know,
b	A.43 utt1	Uh huh, .
b	A.45 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.46 utt2	the mom stayed home, you know, and raised the kids.
sd	B.46 utt3	My mom didn't go back to work until I was in junior high school.
b	A.47 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.48 utt1	so she was there pretty much all my, you know, formative years.
b	A.49 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.50 utt1	And that was nice
sd	B.50 utt2	and I liked that
sd	B.50 utt3	and I would hope that I would be able to give that to my kids.
sv	B.52 utt1	But I think with the way the future is, economy wise,
sv	B.52 utt2	I don't think it's going to be realistic.
aa	A.53 utt1	I know.
aa	A.53 utt2	Unfortunately, that's probably true.
qy	A.53 utt3	do you think the, the parents spend quality time with their kids
qy	A.53 utt4	do you think it's more like watching T V and stuff like that, not really, ...
sv	B.54 utt1	yeah, I, I think that, I think very few spend quality time.
sv	B.54 utt2	I think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff like that.
b	A.55 utt1	Yeah .
sv	B.56 utt1	I think that, most kids that I see they don't really value quality time.
aa	A.57 utt1	Yeah
sv	A.57 utt2	it's always that way until it's too late.
sv	B.58 utt1	until they're older
sv	B.58 utt2	and then they look back.
aa	A.59 utt1	Yeah,
aa	A.59 utt2	it's true,
qw^h	A.59 utt3	what are some other questions they have,
h	A.59 utt4	, I'm not sure.
sd	A.59 utt5	I know my parents are growing up,
sd	A.59 utt6	I guess they never spent much time watching T V.
sd	A.59 utt7	In fact, I've never seen my mom turn on the T V,
sd	A.59 utt8	we didn't really have one .
bh	B.60 utt1	really.
ny	A.61 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.61 utt2	and they spent a lot of time like outside with us and stuff,
sd	A.61 utt3	but, you know, my dad had his own business
sd	A.61 utt4	and it was easier for them to do that,
h	A.61 utt5	but, I don't know,
sd	A.61 utt6	I guess I didn't realize what a luxury it was at the time.
sv	B.62 utt1	I think kids now a days are raised on T V.
sv	B.62 utt2	I mean that's almost like a surog , T V s a surrogate parent.
b	A.63 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.65 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.65 utt2	that's a good way to put it.
sv	B.66 utt1	and not a very good one at that.
aa	A.67 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.67 utt2	that's a pretty good way to put it .
qo	A.67 utt3	well if you had kids, what kind of things do you hope to do? .
sd	B.68 utt1	I hope to, of course, be able to teach them right from wrong.
sd	B.68 utt2	I hope to be able to spend, their growing up years, being in the home, you know, not having to work. and being able to do,
b	A.69 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.70 utt2	I, I know a lot of people who,
sd	B.70 utt3	I work part time also,
sd	B.70 utt5	a lot of people that I work for are, mothers that stay home.
b	A.71 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.72 utt1	and they do a lot of volunteer work
sd	B.72 utt2	and they're real active in the community
sd	B.72 utt3	and, they do a lot of things with their kids that they wouldn't ordinarily be able to do if they were working.
b	A.73 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.74 utt1	And I'd like to be able to do that.
sd	B.74 utt2	I'd like to be able to stay home and be able to spend time with my kids.
bf	A.75 utt1	Do volunteer work and, be in clubs and stuff,
aa	B.76 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.77 utt2	yeah,
aa	A.77 utt3	I agree.
sd	A.77 utt4	I hope that happens, in my case.
b	B.78 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.78 utt2	but, I think that's for the few and far between.
sv	B.78 utt3	I think that, probably ninety percent of the, of the, parents out there are probably working parents.
b	A.79 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.81 utt1	Yeah. .
sv	B.82 utt1	And I don't, I don't really see that trend changing much,
sv	B.82 utt2	if anything, I think, there's going to be fewer and fewer, single income families.
aa	A.83 utt1	I know.
b	A.85 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.85 utt2	and what's sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids. That may not necessarily be consistent with yours.
b	B.86 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.88 utt1	Exactly.
sd	B.88 utt2	See I never, I don't even know what day care is really all about because I never went to a day care center,
b	A.89 utt1	Yeah .
sd	B.90 utt1	I never had that kind of experience.
sd	A.91 utt1	well I don't even think we had ,
sd	A.91 utt2	I don't even remember them being around when we were little.
b	B.92 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.92 utt2	I see, it seems like that's a big trend, you know, in the last ten years.
sv	B.92 utt3	Day cares have, have popped up and become a lot bigger part of the kids' lives.
b	A.93 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.94 utt1	It's like a home away from home for a lot of them.
aa	A.95 utt1	Sure, is, ,
sd	A.95 utt2	well, . I guess we could ring this off since we've exhausted all of our ideas,
sv	A.95 utt3	we seem to agree.
aa	B.96 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.96 utt2	I think, yeah I think this is a good closing point.
aa	A.97 utt1	Yeah,
fc	B.98 utt1	Well it was really nice talking to you.
fc	A.99 utt1	Yeah,
fc	A.99 utt2	you too,
fc	A.99 utt3	I wish you the best.
fc	B.100 utt1	Thanks
fc	B.100 utt2	you too.
fc	A.101 utt1	Okay
fc	A.101 utt2	thanks.
fc	B.102 utt1	bye,
fc	B.102 utt2	bye bye.
fc	A.103 utt1	Bye bye.
