o	A.1 utt1	Okay,
qw	A.1 utt2	what baseball team are you familiar with?
sd	B.2 utt1	Well, I'm only a little bit familiar with the Red Sox because I lived up in Boston for a while,
bh	A.3 utt1	Really?
o	A.5 utt1	now come on,
qy	A.5 utt2	no Texas Rangers?
sd	B.6 utt1	after that, if you asked me that I wouldn't have been able to tell you if that was football or baseball.
bh	A.7 utt1	Really?
sv	A.7 utt2	I guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason which is something we can think about later
sd	A.7 utt3	but, I understand a little bit about the Texas Rangers.
sd	A.7 utt4	I know George Bush threw out the first pitch hitter bounced off the ground
sd	A.7 utt7	I heard a joke on the radio yesterday in regard that he didn't design the patriot missile system,
sv	A.9 utt1	and, the radio's kind of cruel,
sv	A.9 utt2	I mean, think, he, this chain that must have been on President Bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground,
sv	A.9 utt3	I mean, how humiliating for a man to do that, any man.
sv	A.9 utt4	I don't care if you're President.
b	B.10 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.10 utt2	but at the same time, I don't know, it's pretty far to throw that far .
sd	B.10 utt3	I couldn't do it.
aa	A.11 utt1	I know
sv	A.11 utt2	but he's a man
o	A.11 utt3	come on,
qy^g	A.11 utt4	men know how to do that, right?
na	B.12 utt1	Right,
sv	B.12 utt2	he's supposed to be able to do that.
sd	A.13 utt1	I know so,
sd	A.13 utt2	I felt kind of sorry for him.
sv	A.13 utt3	that must have been hard on him because he's just a person
bh	B.14 utt1	really?
sd	B.14 utt2	I didn't know that.
aa	A.15 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.15 utt2	like, I thought he was the owner
sd	A.15 utt3	but it turns out my Mom said that he's part owner
sd	A.15 utt4	but he must own the biggest chunk
sd	A.15 utt5	because that's all you hear about is, if, you know, about Neal Bush I think is his name.
b	B.16 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.17 utt1	See, I even know his name because he's on the news a lot,
sd	A.17 utt2	and I never had to watch the news you know, not like some people hour and a half a day or anything.
b	B.18 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.18 utt3	my husband's French
sd	B.18 utt4	and so if I've been watching the French news, when I watch it.
sv	B.20 utt2	It's incentive ,
sd	B.20 utt3	we're going to get a little off topic but speaking of Bush, that had a story where he went to visit some little, elementary school students, and stuff.
sd	A.21 utt1	I saw that.
qy	B.22 utt1	Did you see that, where the guy asked him for proof of who he was,
ny	A.23 utt1	Yeah.
^q	A.25 utt1	I want to see your driver's lic ,
aa	B.26 utt1	I know
^q	B.26 utt2	and see a credit card .
^q	A.27 utt2	you're not President Bush.
sv	A.27 utt6	it does so fast ,
sd	A.27 utt7	I heard it on the radio.
sd	A.27 utt8	I heard the audio portion on the radio in the car
sd	A.27 utt9	but I didn't see it
sd	B.28 utt1	It was so funny to see,
sd	B.28 utt2	it was a really cute little kid too.
sd	A.29 utt1	That's about baseball,
sd	A.29 utt2	I don't know, that much about it.
sd	B.30 utt1	Well, I can tell you, that the Mets opened, I think, two days ago,
b	A.33 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.34 utt1	because my brother was supposed to go to the opening game,
sd	B.34 utt2	and I couldn't tell you who pitched,
b	A.35 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.36 utt1	but they won,
sd	B.36 utt2	the Mets won.
qy	A.37 utt1	Did they?
ny	B.38 utt1	But, yeah,
sd^e	B.38 utt2	not my a lot, / * sp? by
sd	B.38 utt3	and then somebody else lost,
sd	B.38 utt4	maybe it was the other New York team which is the Yankees,
b	A.39 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.40 utt1	but I don't even know if they're still New York Yankees, or New Jersey.
sv	A.41 utt1	That's so stupid that you all have two teams.
aa	B.42 utt2	Yeah.
sv	A.43 utt1	That's really stupid.
nd	B.44 utt1	Well, but it,
sv	B.44 utt2	then they can have them play against each other.
aa	A.45 utt1	Yeah,
aa	A.45 utt2	I know.
sd	B.46 utt1	I think it's still the New York Yankees, you know,
b	A.47 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.48 utt1	I thought they were moving to New Jersey .
sd	B.48 utt2	This is how much I know about baseball.
sd	A.49 utt1	The Texas Rangers, they lost, I think.
b	B.50 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.51 utt2	we did go to a baseball game last year.
sd	A.51 utt3	We got free tickets because one of the deacons at church, parks cars at The Mansion at Turtle Creek which is like one of the places and stuff.
b	B.52 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.53 utt1	And he's their head chauffeur,
sd	A.53 utt2	is this funny, as they're parking the cars the valet service.
b	B.54 utt1	Right .
b	A.55 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.55 utt2	he makes good money too doing that,
sd	A.55 utt3	I was shocked,
sd	A.55 utt4	but anyway, someone gave an Iranian a tip of four Rangers tickets last year,
b	B.56 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.57 utt2	he didn't want them,
sd	A.57 utt3	so he gave them to Alan,
sd	A.57 utt4	and Alan and his Dad had plans that night
sd	A.57 utt5	so they gave them to us,
sd	A.57 utt6	so he decided that some wealthy man tipped this Iranian, with baseball tickets,
^2	B.58 utt1	With baseball tickets.
sd	A.59 utt2	and we ended up with them, right.
sd	A.59 utt3	And so we were, walking up
b	B.60 utt1	Yeah .
sd	A.61 utt2	and I looked at my husband
sd(^q)	A.61 utt3	and I said, you know what Kyle this is The Mansion at Turtle Creek a tip
^q	A.61 utt4	I bet these are really good seats
sd	A.61 utt5	and so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor,
ba	B.62 utt1	Wow.
aa	A.63 utt1	yeah,
sd	A.63 utt2	they called us at five
sd	A.63 utt3	and the game started at seven
sd	A.63 utt4	so we just threw everything together, ran over and got the tickets and walked
sd	A.63 utt5	and so we took two kids with us
sd	A.63 utt6	and nobody brings two children in these seats, you know because,
^2	B.64 utt1	Because they're fancy seats and stuff.
aa	A.65 utt1	yeah,
sd	A.65 utt2	and you just sit down
sd	A.65 utt3	and all the girls were all dressed up you know,
sd	A.65 utt4	I just was there, you know,
sd	A.65 utt5	like I'm loaded,
sd	A.65 utt6	I'm here, you know,
sd	A.65 utt7	and, it was just kind of funny
sd	A.65 utt8	you know, but we got to sit by first base
sd	A.65 utt9	if they did hit a ball I would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in, you know.
sd	B.66 utt1	I know I'm always scared of that whenever I go to a game.
sd	B.66 utt2	I rarely go
sd	B.66 utt3	but we went last year
sd	B.66 utt4	because my brother is impossible, when, he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff,
b	A.67 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.69 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.70 utt1	and if there's a game on, he's watching it.
sd	B.70 utt2	I mean, that's all there is to it,
bh	A.71 utt1	Really?
sd	B.72 utt1	and he's like glued at the T V.
sd	A.73 utt1	I'm glad my husband's not like that.
sd	B.74 utt1	I'm glad my husband's not like that either,
sd	B.74 utt2	I'd kill him .
sd	B.74 utt3	My brother's like that
sd	B.74 utt4	and, see he goes to a lot of games,
sd	B.74 utt5	not a real lot,
sd	B.74 utt6	but he tries to go,
sd	B.74 utt7	then my father got us some tickets,
b	A.75 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.76 utt1	so my brother's wife and my husband and I went.
sd	B.76 utt2	Last year we wanted to show my husband what a baseball game was because, you know, being a non American you want to see what a baseball game is like.
b	A.77 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.78 utt2	And he describes it as, you sit there in a crowd,
sd	B.78 utt3	it was nice weather and stuff,
sd	B.78 utt4	it wasn't a real problem,
sd	B.78 utt5	but you sit there in a crowd,
sd	B.78 utt6	and you're waiting and waiting and waiting
sd	B.78 utt7	and you eat the hot dogs ,
sd	B.78 utt8	because we made him try a hot dog, you know ,
ba	A.79 utt1	That's funny.
sd	B.80 utt1	so you sit there
sd	B.80 utt2	and you wait for the longest time really bored,
sd	B.80 utt3	and then all of a sudden something happens
sd	B.80 utt4	but you happen to look the other way during the time,
^2	A.81 utt1	You miss the whole thing.
aa	B.82 utt1	yeah,
sd	B.82 utt2	and so basically you sit there and wait for something exciting to happen
sd	B.82 utt3	and when it happened he missed it, and didn't understand it
ba	A.83 utt1	That's funny.
qw	A.85 utt1	Where is he from in France?
b	A.87 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.89 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.89 utt2	I had a friend in college from Strasbourg,
b	B.90 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.90 utt2	he's not that far,
sd	B.90 utt3	he was sort of in between Strasbourg, and Paris.
b	A.91 utt1	Uh huh.
b^m	A.93 utt1	Paris.
sd	A.93 utt2	And my cousin lives in Paris
sd	A.93 utt3	and she's lived there like, off and on for twenty years.
qy	B.94 utt1	is she still there?
ny	A.95 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.97 utt1	Saint Claude is that sound familiar?
ny	B.98 utt1	Yeah,
sd^m	B.98 utt2	Saint Claude,
aa	A.99 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.100 utt1	yeah,
sd	B.100 utt3	that's one of the, entrances to the periphery to get in and out of the city.
bh	A.101 utt1	really?
sd	B.102 utt1	And it, it, it sits right at the limit,
b	A.103 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.104 utt1	I exactly where she is.
sd	B.104 utt2	But, we met in Paris.
ba	A.105 utt1	That's neat.
sd	A.105 utt3	she married
sd	A.105 utt4	and they have twelve children.
qy^m	B.106 utt1	Twelve children?
na^m	A.107 utt1	She has twelve children.
ba	B.108 utt1	my God, the poor woman.
sd	A.109 utt1	She looks gorgeous,
ar	A.109 utt2	no
sd	A.109 utt3	she's gorgeous
sd	A.109 utt4	and she just liked having kids
sd	A.109 utt5	and she's thin
sd	A.109 utt6	and, I mean, four or more children are thin,
qy	B.110 utt1	Were any of them twins?
o	A.111 utt2	I mean, I'm not kidding you.
sv	B.112 utt1	You probably can't afford to eat if you have more than two of them .
aa	A.113 utt1	No,
sd	A.113 utt3	I have a friend now that has seven.
sd	A.113 utt4	and they're all eight and under, and nine and under,
b	B.114 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.115 utt2	they're all real young,
sd	A.115 utt3	they're just raised right
sd	A.115 utt4	that's what God's told them to do
sd	A.115 utt5	but they're not condemning you,
sd	A.115 utt7	we only have one child, you know,
sd	A.115 utt8	they don't put on bad or anything which is good because it would be easy, I'm sure, for them to do that,
sd	A.115 utt9	you get a conviction like that
sd	A.115 utt10	and you think everyone should have it.
sd	A.115 utt11	And so I'm real proud of them because they don't do that at all.
b	B.116 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.117 utt1	You go in their bathroom
sd	A.117 utt2	and there's ten tooth brushes in there.
sd	A.117 utt3	And I always give her a hard time who's toothbrush did you really use this morning .
qw	B.118 utt1	But how do they afford to even have the kids,
sd	B.118 utt2	we're expecting our first baby, almost any day
 b	A.119 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.121 utt1	They live lean for one thing
sd	A.121 utt2	and they tithe
sd*	A.121 utt4	it puts a whole in your money bag, / * spelling: hole
sd	A.121 utt5	we don't honor God with this portion
sv	A.121 utt7	I think that helps a lot.
sv	A.121 utt8	I think that's the key, in like his sales last year
sd	A.121 utt9	he just works a normal job.
sd	A.121 utt10	He probably has an income of thirty five thousand,
sd	A.121 utt11	but last year he made
sd	A.121 utt12	that got him a bonus of twenty five thousand which allowed him to pay cash for a full size van.
sd	A.123 utt1	He loves God,
sd	A.123 utt2	I mean, it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done,
ba	B.124 utt1	Wow.
sd	A.125 utt1	and he got to do it
sd	A.125 utt2	and so God just really blesses him in ways like that,
ad	A.125 utt3	do trust God because, I don't know, kids are a blessing
sv	A.125 utt4	and you know, we think of blessings as nice furniture and things like that,
sv	A.125 utt5	but kids are just as much of a blessing inside these material things
sv	A.125 utt6	but it's a different kind
sv(^q)	A.125 utt7	and a lot times people think, well, I'm not blessed
^q	A.125 utt8	I have an old car.
^q	A.125 utt9	But you've got five kids, you know,
b	B.126 utt1	Uh huh.
^q	A.127 utt1	you're just as blessed, probably more, because if you follow this,
sd	A.127 utt2	there's a good book called WHAT THE BIBLE HAS TO SAY ABOUT CHILD TRAINING, by Richard Fugate
b	B.128 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.129 utt3	a lot of wisdom in it.
sd	A.129 utt4	And the kids at BIBLE talk about anything
sv	A.129 utt5	and training is different than anything else
sv	A.129 utt6	in psychology doesn't address it.
sv	A.129 utt7	the good stuff that's in psychology it just comes out of the BIBLE
sd	A.129 utt8	and they don't quote you the proverb out of it,
sv	A.129 utt9	but the things that work in psychology other the years that they've proven to work, they just come out of the BIBLE
sv	A.129 utt10	and so this book it just really all these things and how to train the child
sd	A.129 utt11	so they're not going to be a curse to you when they're thirteen.
b	B.130 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.131 utt1	I mean how to train them so they're going to be a blessing
sd	A.131 utt2	and so, you know, they do that
sd	A.131 utt3	and they just live lean pretty much
sd	A.131 utt4	she doesn't shop at Foley's you know, and stuff like that.
sv	A.131 utt5	But a lot women die or shop at Foley's
sd	B.132 utt1	I don't know what Foley's is .
sd	A.133 utt1	It's like a Macy's, kind of store,
b	B.134 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.135 utt2	it's pretty nice
sd	A.135 utt3	and everything's pretty expensive
sd	A.135 utt4	and, you know, you just can't do that
sd	A.135 utt5	and you don't go to baseball games as much
sd	A.135 utt6	or you get pictures like we did.
qy	A.135 utt7	You know what I mean?
ny	B.136 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.137 utt1	You do these fun things, you know, in other kinds of ways
sd	A.137 utt2	and I know Manhattan's real expensive
qy^g	A.137 utt3	but, it's kind of a different situation because you're probably living in an apartment, right?
ny	B.138 utt1	Yeah,
sv^e	B.138 utt2	well, that makes a really big difference.
sv	B.138 utt3	But, but, still it's just as hard as having, that,
b	A.139 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.140 utt2	but your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids .
b	B.142 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.143 utt1	they're not all boys
sd	A.143 utt2	and right now we don't have a girls' league because I'm the one that's supposed to start one
sd	A.143 utt3	and I just haven't gotten around to doing it.
sd	A.143 utt4	I keep saying we need to have one.
sd(^q)	A.143 utt5	They go, okay, then start one.
sd	A.143 utt6	But everybody wants to do it
sd	A.143 utt7	but, you know, God's sitting on my heart
sd	A.143 utt8	and I just hadn't gotten around to doing it,
sd	A.143 utt9	so they could really only have four members on the team.
sd	A.143 utt10	I think they only have four boys .
sd	A.143 utt11	I don't even think they have but two old enough to play yet.
b	B.144 utt1	Uh huh.
sv*	A.145 utt1	But, then you didn't believe me about her kids / * listen: this and utt2 as one utt
sd	A.145 utt2	they are so good.
sd	A.145 utt3	I'm not kidding you
sd	A.145 utt4	but she does work with them
sd	A.145 utt5	and it's a commitment
sd	A.145 utt6	and, that's what they're called to do.
b	B.146 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.148 utt1	I admire someone that can do that, you know,
sd	B.148 utt2	I really can.
aa	A.149 utt1	I know,
aa	A.149 utt2	I do too,
sd	A.149 utt3	most of my friends have three or four kids
sd	A.149 utt4	and they feel like, you know, that's really why God
sd	A.149 utt5	and some of the people in our church use birth control
sd	A.149 utt6	and some of them don't,
sd	A.149 utt7	I had my tubes tied
