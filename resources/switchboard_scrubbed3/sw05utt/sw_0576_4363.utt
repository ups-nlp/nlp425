qy	A.3 utt2	are you into the Cowboys?
nn	B.4 utt1	God, no .
nn	B.6 utt1	no,
sd^e	B.6 utt2	I'm not,
sd	B.6 utt3	I haven't been,
sd	B.6 utt4	I grew up in Dallas but I'm still not a Cowboys' man.
sd	B.6 utt5	I like Philadelphia Eagles.
qy	A.7 utt1	yeah?
ny	B.8 utt1	Yeah.
ba	A.9 utt1	Well, that that's all right.
sd	B.10 utt1	That's my favorite team,
sd	B.12 utt1	now that Randall's coming back next season, I hope they'll do a little bit better.
sd	B.12 utt2	They didn't do too bad last season.
b	A.13 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.14 utt1	But, I hope they can do better.
qo	B.14 utt2	How about yourself?
no	A.15 utt1	Well, I don't know.
sd^e	A.15 utt2	I kind of go back and forth, depending on whose really hot and whose not.
sd	A.15 utt3	I guess I'm kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects.
b	B.16 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.17 utt1	But, I guess if I have, my druthers, I'd probably go for the Seattle Seahawks.
sd	A.19 utt1	I kind of like them.
b	B.20 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.20 utt2	That's another one of my favorites.
b	A.21 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.22 utt1	they're not my favorite totally.
sd	B.22 utt2	But I do like them.
sv	B.24 utt1	Seahawks are good.
sd	B.24 utt3	now that Steve Largent is gone, I kind of lose a little bit for them
b	A.25 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.27 utt1	To be honest with you, I probably watch, college a little bit more than I do pro.
qy	B.28 utt1	Really?
ny	A.29 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.31 utt1	I kind of like college actually.
sd	A.31 utt2	Quite a bit.
b	B.32 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.32 utt2	that's kind of strange.
sd	B.32 utt3	It's too much running for me in college football.
sd	B.32 utt4	I like I like the pros.
bh	A.33 utt1	Is it?
sv	B.34 utt3	it's more high tech,
sv	B.34 utt4	more, you know, players are apt to act a little bit different when their jobs and their, when it's a job and not just, you know
aa	A.35 utt1	Yeah,
aa	A.35 utt2	yeah.
am	A.35 utt3	That could be.
sv	B.36 utt1	when you're getting paid millions to do it, I think they take it to another level.
b	A.37 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.38 utt1	But I can see it's more, you know, grunted out, run the ball type.
sv	B.38 utt2	College football is a little bit different
b	A.39 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.39 utt2	You probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then.
qw	B.40 utt1	whose that?
qy	B.42 utt1	Notre Dame ?
nn	A.43 utt1	No.
sd^e	A.43 utt2	I root for Nebraska quite a bit.
b^m	B.44 utt1	Nebraska .
sd	B.44 utt3	there's a running team.
aa	A.45 utt1	Ye , .
b	B.46 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.46 utt2	that, that's boring for me.
sd	B.46 utt3	I'll take the passing teams any day.
b	A.47 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.49 utt1	Well, I can see definitely how you get into that.
sd	A.49 utt2	to be honest with you, I find that too much running gets pretty boring as well
b	B.50 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.50 utt2	it's four yards, three yards eight yards, tackle.
b	A.51 utt1	Right.
sv	B.52 utt2	you know, it gets kind of monotonous.
sv	B.52 utt3	After awhile, I prefer a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and then just to juice it up a little bit
b	A.53 utt1	Sure.
sv	A.55 utt1	Well, I think they're starting to realize that.
sv	A.55 utt2	A lot of like the big eight teams that used to run so much. I think they're starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore.
b	B.56 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.56 utt2	It's high dollar.
sv	B.56 utt3	You know, it's all money now.
sd	B.56 utt4	Even college is all can we get on T V
b	A.57 utt1	Right.
b	A.59 utt1	Yeah.
qy	A.61 utt2	this World League is coming in?
qy^g	A.61 utt3	that's getting ready to start up, right?
na	B.62 utt1	Right.
ny	B.62 utt2	Yeah.
qy	A.63 utt1	Have you followed that very much
ng	B.64 utt1	not really.
sv	B.64 utt2	I don't think anything will ever take over the N F L.
sv	B.64 utt3	I think you know, it's, it's an institution.
b	A.65 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.66 utt2	It's like if we tried to start something to take over major league baseball.
b	A.67 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.68 utt1	I mean, it, it can be, it can take over part of it.
sv	B.68 utt2	But it's never going to be the next,
aa	A.69 utt1	Right.
sv	A.69 utt2	It can take over a small market share
b	B.70 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.70 utt2	it's going to take a little bit.
sv	B.70 utt3	Some people are going to watch it
sv	B.70 utt4	but it's not going to be wide spread super bowl and every Sunday afternoon or anything, you know.
b	A.71 utt1	Right.
sv	B.72 utt1	it's never going to reach that standard
aa	A.73 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.73 utt2	I think I agree with you.
sd	A.73 utt3	it's kind of interesting to see their claim of, you know, like world football.
sd	A.73 utt4	But, when in reality, it's really Americans playing somewhere else you know .
aa	B.74 utt1	Yeah,
aa	B.74 utt2	yeah.
sv	B.74 utt3	it's kind of strange.
sv	B.74 utt4	I guess we're the only ones, who take it that far.
sv	B.76 utt2	Everybody else still nuts over soccer
b	A.77 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.77 utt2	Actually, I kind of like soccer.
sd	A.77 utt3	I've never really played it
bh	B.78 utt1	Yeah?
sd	A.79 utt2	but, I like the idea.
sv	A.79 utt3	it's an interesting game to watch.
sv	A.79 utt4	That and rugby.
sd	A.79 utt5	I've like to watch, rugby every now and then.
b	B.82 utt1	Yeah
sd	B.82 utt2	or Australian rules football.
b	A.83 utt1	Yeah,
h	A.83 utt2	whatever you want to call it there.
b	B.84 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.84 utt2	That's some brutal stuff there.
sv	B.84 utt3	that's worse than football as far as violence I think.
fe	B.84 utt4	Golly.
sv	B.84 utt5	Those guys kill each other out there.
sv	B.84 utt6	Rugby is something else.
aa	A.85 utt1	Yeah, .
aa	A.85 utt2	Yeah,
sv	A.85 utt3	there's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere .
b	B.86 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.86 utt2	That's just wild.
sv	B.86 utt3	That's why it's a big college thing.
b	A.87 utt1	Yeah
sv	B.88 utt1	Rugby is definitely big in college
sv	B.88 utt2	because it's something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do .
aa	A.89 utt1	Right,
aa	A.89 utt2	exactly .
aa	A.89 utt3	Yeah.
b	B.90 utt1	So, yeah,
sv	B.90 utt2	I could see the feel for that.
sd	B.90 utt3	But it's pretty, it's fun to play.
b	A.91 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.92 utt1	I'll give it that.
sv*	B.92 utt2	It is fun to play. If you don't value your * listen missing a word? very much.
qy	A.93 utt1	You've played it then?
sv	B.94 utt2	But, you know, I don't think rugby will ever be professional
aa	A.95 utt1	No I doubt it, you know.
sv	A.95 utt2	Not, at least not in this country anyway.
aa	B.98 utt1	No.
sv	B.98 utt2	You can't stay healthy and do that.
sv	B.98 utt3	That's a rough game.
aa	A.99 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.99 utt2	It is.
h	B.100 utt1	But, I don't know.
sd	B.100 utt2	I don't know how my Eagles are going to do this year.
sv	B.102 utt1	the Seahawks are an up and down kind of team.
aa	A.103 utt1	They really are.
aa	A.103 utt2	Yeah.
b	B.104 utt1	Yeah.
sd*	B.104 utt2	my, it's kind of odd. My roommate that I live with here, he's lived in Pennock, Minnesota. / * two utts?
qy	B.104 utt3	Do you know where that is?
nn	A.105 utt1	no
sd^e	A.105 utt2	I don't.
sd	B.106 utt1	it's a small town.
sd	B.106 utt3	it's in like central Minnesota.
sd	B.106 utt4	It's a couple of hours, west of Minneapolis.
b	A.107 utt1	Okay.
sd	A.109 utt1	To tell you the truth, I'm not even really from here.
bf	B.110 utt1	You just live there now.
aa	A.111 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.111 utt2	I'm up here for a year on an internship.
b	B.112 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.113 utt1	But I actually live in Florida.
b^m	B.114 utt1	Live in Florida.
aa	A.115 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.116 utt1	Like the Seahawks .
qy^g	A.117 utt1	Well, you know, {E I . I mean, } who who the heck is going to root for Tampa Bay, right ?
sd	B.118 utt1	Hey, I I've only been to Philadelphia twice
aa	B.122 utt1	Really,
aa^r	B.122 utt2	really.
sd	A.123 utt1	I mean, I guess I could go for Miami
h	A.123 utt2	but I don't know.
b	B.124 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.125 utt3	I root for Nebraska
sd	A.125 utt4	so I don't have a real love for Miami anyway.
h	A.127 utt1	But, I don't know,
