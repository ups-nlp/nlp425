qo	A.1 utt1	What do you think? .
sd	B.2 utt1	Well, I can't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago, because I'm not that old yet.
b	A.3 utt1	Uh huh.
ad	A.5 utt2	but go ahead .
sd	B.6 utt3	I mean you didn't have video games.
sd	B.6 utt4	You didn't have home computers.
sd	B.6 utt5	You didn't have Xerox machines.
b	A.7 utt1	Right.
sd	B.8 utt2	you go into a business today
sd	B.8 utt3	and, you try to imagine the whole thing except running off of carbon paper
sv	B.8 utt4	and it's almost inconceivable now because the Xerox machines and everything have become you know, su , such a par , a part of the way we live.
aa	A.9 utt1	Right.
sd	A.9 utt2	We fax everything.
b	B.12 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.13 utt1	We don't even wait for the mail anymore.
b	B.14 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.15 utt1	Right.
b	B.16 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.16 utt2	a business associate of mine was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail
sd	B.16 utt3	and you had to do something,
sd	B.16 utt4	this was concerning the S E C,
sd	B.16 utt5	and so if they had business to do, they had to finish it, you know, three days in advance so they could get it through the mail.
b	A.17 utt1	Right.
sd@	B.18 utt1	And now it's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute. * slash error Because you can get it there, you know * "Because" as connector; sd in a matter of minutes you know, through a fax machine
b	A.19 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.21 utt1	Uh huh .
b	A.23 utt1	Right.
sv	B.24 utt2	and because of that, these quote, unquote convenience type items have made work that much more intense and that much harder.
b	A.25 utt1	Right.
sv	B.26 utt1	Because you're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute.
aa^m	A.27 utt1	You're expected to,
aa	A.27 utt2	exactly.
sd	A.27 utt3	And I recently read an article on just this, that said stress today is so much worse .
sd	A.27 utt4	It should be less because we have a microwave
sd	A.27 utt5	and our grandmothers had to bake brownies
sd	A.27 utt6	and we can throw them in a microwave for two minutes
sd	A.27 utt7	but the more conveniences we have, the more that's expected of us
b	B.28 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.29 utt1	and we have no down time.
sv	A.29 utt2	Like we don't stop and wait for things to happen because we don't have to.
b	B.30 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.31 utt1	So we keep moving.
sv	A.31 utt2	We don't stop and wait for the things to bake and this to happen and that to happen.
sv	A.31 utt3	We just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing.
sv	A.31 utt4	So we have no relaxation time in between
b	B.32 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.33 utt1	so they say that's really a bad thing. That you need to learn a lot of ways to deal with that and get your time in between things.
b	B.34 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.35 utt1	So that's good.
sv	A.35 utt2	That's an interesting point.
sv	A.35 utt3	But I just think our family lives have changed drastically.
sv	A.37 utt2	of course a part of it is technology.
qh	A.37 utt3	I mean our kids, where would they be without Nintendo and, you know, their T V shows
sv	A.37 utt5	some of that is really bad I think.
sv	A.37 utt6	But, we have all single families.
sd	A.37 utt7	So many single families now.
sd	A.37 utt8	a lot of working,
sd	A.37 utt9	both parents are working.
sv	A.37 utt10	So there's a whole big effect on our kids
sd	A.37 utt11	and not very many of my daughter's friends really are on their original mother and father.
sd	A.37 utt12	You know, I'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years.
aa	B.38 utt1	Well, there's that
sd	B.38 utt2	and there's the fact that, you know, nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have kids which generally tends to happen.
sd	B.38 utt3	I mean the U S would be actually declining in population slightly if it weren't for the fact that we, have continuation, large scale immigration into the country.
aap	A.41 utt1	You're probably right .
sd	A.41 utt2	And I'm an O B nurse
sd	A.41 utt3	and that's never really occurred to me but that's interesting.
sd	A.41 utt4	I never really thought about it that way.
b	B.42 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.42 utt2	yeah.
sd	B.42 utt3	I saw the numbers on that awhile back
sd(^q)	B.42 utt4	and I was like, uh huh
aa	A.43 utt1	Yeah,
aa	A.43 utt2	yeah.
aa	A.43 utt3	That's true.
sd	B.44 utt1	Well, In terms of the long term effect on America, in terms of the culture and everything, I don't know.
sv	A.45 utt1	We don't know that yet .
sv	B.46 utt2	 of the next generation is going to be or, or an, ex , ex , extremely large part of the next generation is going to be, you know, second generation, from immigrant parents.
aa	A.47 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.47 utt2	I don't know either.
aa	A.51 utt1	That's true.
sv	B.52 utt1	And they're going to be really struggling
sv	B.52 utt2	and I don't think that America is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered to be good .
aa	A.53 utt1	Right,
aa^m	A.53 utt2	right.
sd	B.54 utt1	I mean, it's no longer the, the accomplishment that it once was
sv	B.54 utt2	and not that many people are really trying I don't think .
aa	A.55 utt1	Yeah.
aa^r	A.55 utt2	Yeah.
sv	A.55 utt3	That's kind of scary.
aa	A.55 utt4	Well that's true.
sv	A.55 utt6	it's just very different
sv	A.55 utt7	and I guess every ten years it's just been very different.
b	B.56 utt1	Yeah .
sd	A.57 utt1	So. And I don't know what's going to happen.
sd	A.57 utt2	I know what I'm seeing here at my job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they're establishing careers
aa	B.58 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.59 utt2	and they've got their homes
