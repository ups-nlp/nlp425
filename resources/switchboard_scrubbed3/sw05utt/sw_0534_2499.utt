o	B.1 utt1	Okay.
o	A.2 utt1	All right.
qo	A.2 utt2	What have you seen?
sd	B.3 utt1	The latest movie I've seen that I thought was fantastic was DANCES WITH WOLVES.
sd	A.4 utt2	I knew you were going to say that.
sd	A.4 utt3	I want to go see that.
ba	B.5 utt1	man.
sd	B.7 utt1	I just finally ended up going to see it,
sd	B.7 utt2	and one day my husband had the kids
sd	B.7 utt3	and I just went because we could never get to go see it together because it's so long.
sd	B.7 utt4	By the time we had a babysitter for that long.
ba	A.8 utt1	Gosh.
sd	B.9 utt1	So I finally just went to see it.
sd	B.9 utt2	And I just thought it was fantastic.
b	A.10 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.10 utt2	I, I watched, Costner on the Academy Awards.
sd	A.10 utt3	I was really happy that he got,
sd	A.10 utt4	I was hoping he was going to get Best Actor.
b	B.11 utt1	Yeah.
b^r	B.11 utt2	Yeah.
sv	A.12 utt1	but he, he did pretty good on that one.
sv	B.13 utt2	the buffalo scene in that thing was so real.
b	A.14 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.15 utt3	I mean it just blew me away.
b	A.16 utt1	Yeah,
ba	A.16 utt2	I bet.
b	A.18 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.18 utt2	There're several of them that are out right now that I want to see.
sd	A.18 utt3	 DANCES. SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
b	B.19 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.21 utt1	I'm afraid to go see that one.
sv	B.21 utt2	That one looks so scary just, from the previews.
sd	B.23 utt2	I thought gosh I'd probably have nightmares for the next six months .
ar	A.24 utt1	Nay.
sd	B.25 utt2	It's supposed to be good though.
ar	A.26 utt1	Nay.
sd	A.26 utt2	That's what people said,
sd	B.27 utt2	I know some friends who went to see it.
b	A.28 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.29 utt1	They said it was really riveting.
b	A.30 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.30 utt2	Well, you know, they, that's what they said about THE EXORCIST, you know.
ar	A.30 utt3	no,
sv	A.30 utt4	it's terrible.
sv	A.30 utt5	You'll have nightmares, you know.
sd	A.30 utt6	I watched last weekend.
sd	A.30 utt7	Me and my roommate.
sd	A.30 utt8	we laughed about it .
sv	B.31 utt1	Well, you're not a thirteen year old.
h	B.31 utt2	I don't know.
sd	B.31 utt3	I saw it when I was a kid
sd(^q)	B.31 utt4	and I thought, man .
sd	A.32 utt2	well I, I guess it was because I'd read the book before I saw the movie.
b	B.33 utt1	uh huh.
sd	A.34 utt1	And the book, to me, was far more frightening than the movie was.
b	B.35 utt1	really.
ba	B.35 utt2	Gosh.
b	A.36 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.36 utt2	He's a very good writer
sv	A.36 utt3	and he had a way of putting you in that scene, you know.
ba	B.37 utt1	boy.
b	A.38 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.38 utt2	And, of course, I was living alone at the time
sd	A.38 utt3	and it was late at night and scary and, you know .
sd	A.38 utt4	You start hearing noises you know.
ba	B.39 utt1	Gosh.
ba	B.39 utt2	Call the crisis line.
aa	B.41 utt1	Yeah,
ba	B.41 utt2	I bet.
sd	A.42 utt1	And there's rats in the attic, you know.
ba	B.43 utt1	gosh.
^h	A.44 utt1	let's see.
sd	A.44 utt2	There was a couple of others that are out,
sd	A.46 utt1	and I can't remember,
sd	B.47 utt1	I saw one I thought was crummy.
sd	B.47 utt2	With that new, Michael J Fox movie, THE HARD WAY.
sd	B.47 utt3	Where he plays a actor that's, like th ,
b	A.48 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.48 utt2	I didn't, I didn't even like the previews on that.
aa	B.49 utt1	I know.
sd	B.49 utt3	well I ended up at the theater
sd	B.49 utt4	and there didn't seem to be anything else on I wanted to see,
sd	B.49 utt5	so I'll try that.
sv	B.51 utt1	But it wasn't worth anything.
sd	B.51 utt2	I didn't care for that at all.
aa	A.52 utt1	No.
sd	A.54 utt1	I don't much care for Michael J Fox anyway.
b	B.55 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.55 utt2	Well, the last two I saw him in, one of those BACK TO THE FUTURE, PART THREE deals
sv	B.55 utt3	and that was crummy also.
sd	B.55 utt4	I didn't think that was any good
b	A.56 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.58 utt1	I saw the original BACK TO THE FUTURE
sd	A.58 utt3	I hardly ever go see a sequel.
b	B.59 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.60 utt1	I mean, I think the only I've ever seen a sequel was TWO THOUSAND AND ONE.
ba	B.61 utt1	boy.
sv	A.62 utt1	TWO THOUSAND AND TEN was far better.
b	B.63 utt1	Yeah.
b^r	B.63 utt2	Yeah.
sv	A.64 utt1	TWO THOUSAND AND ONE was a good movie if you had read the book.
sd	B.65 utt1	Well, I hadn't read it
sd	B.65 utt2	and I couldn't figure what was going on half the time,
aa	A.66 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.66 utt2	No,
sv	A.66 utt3	nobody could figure it out.
sv	A.66 utt4	I mean the book was so much,
b	B.67 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.68 utt3	all you can do is put it in words.
sv	A.68 utt4	You can't put it in pictures.
b	B.69 utt1	Yeah.
b^r	B.69 utt2	Yeah.
sv(^q)	A.70 utt1	You know, a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film, you say what is this?
qh	A.72 utt1	You know, what's the significance of the apes, you know .
b	B.73 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.73 utt2	yeah.
sd	B.73 utt3	I should probably go back and read the book now that I just saw the movie again not too long ago.
sv	A.74 utt1	the book is really good.
sd	A.74 utt2	I mean, I keep a little library of books that I just like to read over and over again
sd	A.74 utt3	and that's one of them.
ba	B.75 utt1	Wow.
sv	A.76 utt1	it's so well written.
sd	B.77 utt1	Well, I have one I bet you haven't seen if you don't have kids. OTIS AND MILO.
aa	A.78 utt1	you're right.
sd	A.78 utt2	I haven't .
sd	B.79 utt1	that is the most precious movie.
sd	B.79 utt2	It has, to see it on the big screen because it's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you've ever seen in your life.
sd	B.79 utt4	it's the story of this little cat and dog
sd	B.79 utt5	and it's not like cutesy.
sd	B.79 utt6	it's just so realistic. Everything they do.
sd	B.79 utt7	You wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things.
sd	B.81 utt1	And it was, A real dog and cat
qy	A.82 utt1	a real dog and cat?
sd	B.85 utt2	and all the other animals.
sd	B.85 utt3	They initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they're raised.
sd	B.85 utt4	And then the cat gets, on this treacherous journey.
sd	B.85 utt5	He climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river
sd	B.85 utt6	and he winds up all over creation.
sd	B.85 utt7	I don't know where in the world it is.
sd	B.85 utt8	Somewhere in China somewhere I think that it was filmed.
sd	B.87 utt1	But, it's just really an incredible thing.
sd	A.88 utt1	sounds sort of like the incredible journey.
b	B.89 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.89 utt2	It was pretty wild
sd	B.89 utt3	and . Of course, the only sound is Dudley Moore narrates it.
b	A.90 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.91 utt1	But there's you know, nothing else to keep it going.
sd	B.91 utt2	But it really keeps keeps me going.
sd	B.93 utt2	I've seen it twice now .
b	A.94 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.94 utt2	that sounds a lot like a Walt Disney film.
sv	A.96 utt1	Sounds a lot a like a Walt Disney film.
aa	B.97 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.97 utt2	It was like the best of the Walt Disney ones.
sv	B.97 utt3	Walt Disney's kind of gotten worse in my opinion over the past few years.
aa	A.98 utt1	yeah.
sv	A.98 utt2	Not anymore.
sd	A.98 utt3	I mean, I, I was raised on Walt Disney films. You know.
b	B.99 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.100 utt1	OLD YELLER. BIG RED.
b	B.101 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.101 utt2	All those old good ones that you, you know, wish they had on more now,
b	A.102 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.104 utt1	When I was a little kid, I saw the INCREDIBLE JOURNEY on Christmas Eve
sd	A.104 utt2	and it was so good that I had forgotten that it was Christmas Eve.
ba	B.105 utt1	boy.
sv	A.108 utt2	I mean that's something for a kid.
ba	B.109 utt1	That's pretty good.
ba	B.111 utt1	Really.
sd	A.112 utt1	And that was something for greedy old me at Christmas time, I'll tell you.
^h	B.113 utt1	Let's see.
t1	B.113 utt2	What are some other ones I've seen lately.
^h	B.113 utt3	I'm trying to remember.
sd	B.113 utt4	I can't.
sd	B.113 utt5	I just saw one on the video.
qy	B.113 utt6	have you seen THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY, PART TWO?
nn	A.114 utt1	No .
sd	B.115 utt1	That is a riot.
bh	A.116 utt1	Is it?
ny	B.117 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.117 utt2	The first one was really good.
sd	B.117 utt3	But the second one , is really good too.
sd	B.119 utt2	I was really surprised.
b	A.120 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.120 utt2	I didn't much care for the first one.
nd	B.121 utt1	No,
sv	B.121 utt2	I thought it was funny.
h	B.121 utt3	But, that's my sense of humor .
co	A.122 utt1	Well, I'll have to go get that one I guess.
sv	B.123 utt1	It's hard to find movies that aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore.
sv	B.123 utt2	And I guess I'm just middle America or something.
sd	B.123 utt3	I just go to be entertained
sd	B.123 utt4	and and not really interested in like the TERMINATOR or some of the Schwarzenegger stuff.
aa	A.124 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.126 utt2	I get so tired of, you know, these, you know, sequels.
sd	A.126 utt3	Number nine, number ten, number fourteen.
b	B.127 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.129 utt1	FREDDY'S REVENGE PART TWENTY FIVE or whatever.
aa	A.130 utt1	Yeah, you know.
aa^r	A.130 utt2	Yeah, you know.
b	B.131 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.132 utt1	FREDDY EATS A NUCLEAR WARHEAD, you know.
sd	A.132 utt3	I'm so sick and tired of that.
^h	A.134 utt1	I just can't believe it.
sv	A.134 utt2	It's like ROCKY films.
sd	A.134 utt3	I I haven't seen a one.
aa	B.135 utt1	Yeah.
aa^r	B.135 utt2	Yeah.
sd	B.135 utt3	I've never seen any of those.
sd	A.136 utt2	I can't stand Stallone.
aa	B.137 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.137 utt2	I can't either.
sv	B.137 utt3	He seems so macho I just .
aa	A.138 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.138 utt2	And I was afraid that RAMBO was going to do the same thing that ROCKY was going to do, you know. Go into fourteen hundred episodes.
b	B.139 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.141 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.142 utt1	Now I hardly ever watch T V.
sd	A.142 utt2	If I ever get the hankering to see something, I've got, I don't know, maybe about thirty or forty movies
aa	B.143 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.143 utt2	When they're so cheap too at the video stores that you can.
aa	A.144 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.144 utt2	I don't even rent them. You know.
bh	B.145 utt1	You don't?
sd	A.146 utt1	I figure if I find a movie I like, I'll buy it.
sd	A.146 utt2	Cause I just watch them over and over again.
sd	B.147 utt2	my husband does that.
sd	B.147 utt3	He can watch them over and over.
b	A.148 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.149 utt3	there's very few I would want to see that many times.
sd	B.149 utt4	So he, once he has one he likes, he likes to watch it over and over.
b	A.150 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.150 utt2	my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is, EXCALIBUR.
aa	B.151 utt1	yeah.
sv	B.151 utt2	That was a good one.
sd	B.151 utt3	I haven't seen that one in a long time.
sd	A.152 utt1	I loved that film.
sv	A.152 utt2	it's just so well done.
b	B.153 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.154 utt1	And I lived over in England for four years,
ba	B.155 utt1	boy.
sd	A.156 utt1	That was the first place I ever saw it.
b	B.157 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.158 utt2	it was so good.
ba	B.159 utt1	gosh.
sd	A.160 utt1	it was filmed in Ireland.
sd	A.162 utt1	And they got pretty scenery in Ireland.
b	B.163 utt1	Yeah,
ba	B.163 utt2	I bet .
aa	A.164 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.164 utt2	it's nice.
ba	B.165 utt1	Gosh.
sd	A.166 utt1	And I've been down to the south of England where supposedly King Arthur's castle was.
ba	B.167 utt1	boy.
bf	B.167 utt2	So, that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that.
aa	A.168 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.168 utt2	yeah it was unimpressive to look at.
sd	A.168 utt3	I mean, the whole thing was about the size of a medium house .
ba	B.169 utt1	really .
sd	B.169 utt2	Well, when I was in England years ago.
sd	B.169 utt3	And I went to like Shakespeare's and, you know, Stratford On Avon and all that
b	A.170 utt1	yeah.
sd	B.171 utt2	and it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it
sd	B.171 utt3	because it was so short.
b	A.172 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.173 utt2	The ceilings were so short.
b	A.174 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.176 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.176 utt2	There's some nice stuff over there to see.
b	B.177 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.178 utt1	I spent four years traveling around and didn't see, you know, hardly anything.
ba	B.179 utt1	boy.
sd	A.180 utt1	I need, to go over there and stay about twenty years so I can just travel. Go around all the places.
b	B.183 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.184 utt2	Stonehenge, of course, you know.
sv	A.184 utt3	everybody makes the obligatory trip to Stonehenge.
b	B.185 utt1	Yeah,
b	B.185 utt2	yeah.
sv	A.186 utt1	Okay,
sv	A.186 utt2	big deal.
sd	A.186 utt3	Here's some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field.
sv	A.186 utt4	Okay .
sv	A.186 utt5	It's boring.
qy	B.187 utt1	Did you see any movies over there ?
sd	B.189 utt1	I remember I went to see DON QUIXOTE over there when it came out.
sd	B.189 utt2	It came out right around the time, with Sophia Loren
sd	B.189 utt3	and that was a riot to see that.
o	A.190 utt1	You know something,
sd	A.190 utt2	come to think of it, I don't think I went to the movies one time.
b	B.191 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.191 utt2	Cause when you're touristing, you probably don't want to take the time to go see a movie.
sd	A.192 utt2	where I lived. it was a little town called Newmarket. About seventy miles north of London.
ba	B.195 utt1	boy .
sd	A.196 utt1	And there was another town called Barry Saint Edmunds about twenty miles away from us.
b	B.197 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.198 utt1	And they had a little, theater company there
sd	A.198 utt2	and we use to go out to that about once a week.
ba	B.199 utt1	boy.
aa	A.200 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.200 utt2	A really nice place.
sd	A.200 utt3	You know, amateurs but really quite good.
b	B.201 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.202 utt1	but that was interesting.
sd	A.202 utt2	Course go to London quite a lot and see shows down there.
ba	B.203 utt1	That sounds great.
b	B.205 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.206 utt1	but other than that I just didn't have time to go to the movies, you know.
b	B.207 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.208 utt1	Never sho , anyway, anything that I ever wanted,
sd	A.208 utt2	I rented a lot of videos .
b	B.209 utt1	Uh huh
sd	A.210 utt1	Cause the closest movie theater was Barry Saint Edmunds
sv	A.210 utt2	and who wants who wants to drive twenty miles to go to the movies .
ba	B.211 utt1	boy.
sv	B.213 utt1	Probably some of them did .
sd	A.214 utt1	a lot of people did.
b	B.215 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.216 utt1	But it would have to be a good show.
b	B.217 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.217 utt2	It's hard to know what the good movies are anymore.
b	A.218 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.219 utt1	Because sometimes the reviews you just can't go by.
b	A.220 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.220 utt3	they, they have all these neat phrases. You know, you know, you know. Like critically acclaimed.
b	B.221 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.224 utt1	That's what they when the thing hasn't won any award. / * listen
ba	B.225 utt1	I see .
sv	B.227 utt1	It's kind of like waterfront property or something you know, if you're two miles away from water .
b	A.228 utt1	Yeah,
b	A.228 utt2	yeah.
b	A.230 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.230 utt2	from Love Canal .
sv	B.231 utt1	Water view .
sv	A.232 utt1	Waterfront property here at Love Canal, you know.
b	B.233 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.234 utt1	But, you know, critically acclaimed.
fe	A.234 utt2	good grief.
fe	A.234 utt3	Give me a break.
sd	A.236 utt2	I mean, there's a lot of reasons why I don't go to movies.
b	B.237 utt1	Uh huh.
fa	A.238 utt1	And primarily, I mean, now I'm probably going to upset you.
sd	A.238 utt2	But people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me .
