qw	B.1 utt2	what do you usually wear to work? .
sd	A.2 utt1	Well, I am basically retired now.
b	B.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.4 utt2	I was in education and in administration,
b	B.5 utt1	Uh huh.
sd@	A.6 utt1	so basically I wore dresses. * slash... And, heels,
b	B.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.8 utt2	and I because my work often took me into court, never was one that got, accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work.
b	B.9 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.10 utt1	But that was just me.
sd	A.10 utt2	I know many people are very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants.
sd	A.12 utt2	I guess I was just old enough not to, be very comfortable in it.
b	B.13 utt1	Uh huh.
qo	A.14 utt1	How about you?
sd	B.15 utt1	Well, I work at T I
sd	B.15 utt2	and they don't really have, dress code, so to speak there.
sd	B.15 utt3	It's pretty lax about, you know,
sd	B.15 utt4	you can pretty much wear whatever you want to,
sd	B.15 utt5	and I wear anything from jeans, when I'm feeling really casual to, suits and dresses when I'm meeting with a customer
sd@	B.15 utt6	or, I teach training classes, * need slash and so when I'm teaching a class, obviously I wear a suit or dress, / * sd
b	A.16 utt1	Oh.
b	A.18 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.19 utt2	and when it's raining, I'm more likely to wear jeans
sd	B.21 utt2	and when it's really cold I'm more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters, or that type of thing.
b	A.22 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.23 utt1	but it just really depends on the weather and my mood
sd	B.23 utt2	and then, you know, obviously when I'm doing anything that I'm in front of people, or making presentations, teaching, whatever. I'm going to dress up more .
aa	A.24 utt1	Yes.
sv	A.26 utt1	And I think that does make a difference,
sv	A.26 utt2	because when you do have to be in front of people, I think the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and, more classical style of clothing.
b	B.27 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.29 utt1	Uh huh.
qw	A.30 utt1	What about the mini skirt?
sd	B.31 utt1	There are a few people every now and then that wear those to work.
sd	B.31 utt2	There pretty strict about that, though.
sd	B.31 utt3	I've never worn,
sv	B.31 utt6	well jeans aren't exactly professional
sv	B.31 utt7	but, for some reason a mini skirt is, to me a little more unprofessional to wear to work than jeans
sv	B.31 utt8	maybe it's just because of the sexist views and everything
sv	B.31 utt9	but you just feel like you're showing too much le ,
h	B.31 utt10	I don't know,
sd	B.31 utt11	I wouldn't want to wear a mini skirt to work.
sd	B.33 utt1	I have seen a few people do it though,
sd	B.33 utt3	and they weren't overly revealing.
sd	B.33 utt4	They were pretty much in good taste,
b	A.34 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.35 utt1	for me I just, wouldn't want to do that.
sv	A.36 utt1	Well there are mini skirts and there are mini skirts.
b	B.37 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.38 utt1	There are some that are really short
sv	A.38 utt2	and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee.
b	B.39 utt1	Uh huh,
sd	B.39 utt2	that's what I've seen.
sv	A.40 utt1	and again it depends upon the size, the shape of the person, as well as the shape of the person's legs.
b	B.41 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.43 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.44 utt2	even though I retired from education, I do modeling
sd	A.44 utt3	and I teach at a modeling agency here.
b	B.45 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.46 utt1	so, when we are doing wardrobing and we have, two hour classes in wardrobe, we do discuss a great deal, the mini skirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job.
b	B.47 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.48 utt1	even though I may have them from sixth grade on up through, grandmothers, in my class.
b	B.49 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.50 utt2	And, I always try to emphasize the, clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad,
b	B.51 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.52 utt1	because maybe those are not the clothes that are the most, appealing to you, or the most, complimentary to you.
aa	B.53 utt1	Right.
sv	A.54 utt1	But, the mini skirt many times will evoke comments you don't really want.
b	B.55 utt1	Right .
sv	A.56 utt1	and then you're in the situation where you're very unhappy.
 b	B.57 utt1	Uh huh.
 sv	B.57 utt2	Well I feel like too, on the job, when, you know, there's men around and some of the managers are men, you know, you don't want them looking at your legs necessarily.
aa	A.58 utt1	That's right.
sd	B.59 utt1	And, to me I just wouldn't feel comfortable in that at work,
sd	A.60 utt1	Well, I, I have to, agree with that, even when they was very, very popular in the early sixties,
b	B.61 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.62 utt2	again maybe because I was at the school, there were still many teachers who wore mini skirts,
b	B.63 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.64 utt1	we had no regulation against it
sd	A.64 utt2	and a lot of the kids did of course,
sd	A.64 utt3	and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers.
b	B.65 utt1	Right .
sd	A.66 utt1	Because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts.
b	B.67 utt1	Right.
sv	A.68 utt1	And so, I think, of course, now I go the other extreme, I do not like to see, in the corporate areas, all the women dressed like men, with the suits and, white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same.
b	B.69 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.71 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.72 utt1	I don't like that,
sv	A.72 utt3	I think there should be individuality in dressing.
b	B.73 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.73 utt2	Even with the very tailored look of a suit, sometimes I like to have a lit , just a little something that's feminine.
aa	A.74 utt1	Yes.
sv	B.75 utt2	you don't want to over do it but, just a little, a touch of it just to say, yes, I am a woman,
aa	A.76 utt1	Right.
sd	B.77 utt1	but I can be professional too.
sv	A.78 utt1	and I don't think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to look professional.
aa	B.79 utt1	Right,
b	B.79 utt2	uh huh.
sv	A.80 utt1	I think that you make of that what you wish
sv	A.80 utt2	and you can go the opposite direction and, over do all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you, which don't belong in, at least in my opinion, in the work place,
b	B.81 utt1	Right.
sv	A.82 utt2	you can have a classical look without a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine.
b	B.83 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.84 utt1	Because that was one thing I always fought against.
sd	A.84 utt2	I started out as a physical education teacher.
b	B.85 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.86 utt1	So I was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or manish,
b	B.87 utt1	Right.
sd	A.88 utt1	and people would never, ever guess that I was Phys Ed
sd	A.88 utt2	and that pleased me,
b	B.89 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.90 utt1	and so, then I, of course, just continued what I considered the best style of clothing for me at work
sd	A.90 utt2	and I find even at home here now, I, I will wear blue jeans or I'll wear shorts and what have you, and be very comfortable
sd	A.90 utt3	but when I go out somewhere, then, unless I have a pair of dress slacks, I don't usually wear a lot of blue jeans.
b	B.91 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.92 utt1	I have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how.
b	B.93 utt1	Uh huh .
sv	A.94 utt1	And, so, I just feel that, you know each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort.
b	B.95 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.96 utt1	But, there are certain norms that companies should be able to, put out as guidelines for their employees.
aa	B.97 utt1	Right,
sd	B.97 utt2	that's one thing I like about T I is that they aren't overly strict about what you wear
sd	B.97 utt3	and you know, your boss doesn't come up to you and say now remember, tomorrow you have a meeting so you'd better wear a suit.
sd	B.99 utt1	I mean, they leave it up to you and your judgment to, to use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have.
b	A.100 utt1	Right.
b	A.102 utt1	Yes.
sd	B.103 utt1	The only real restrictions they have are, no halter tops and no shorts, even the long walking short of the squirts, the split skirts, anything that could be considered shorts they don't allow.
b	A.104 utt1	Yes.
ba	A.106 utt1	That's good.
sd	B.107 utt1	And they don't allow, any sweat shirts or t shirts that might have vulgar, or, you know, anything like that on it,
sd	B.107 utt2	but, other than that, it's pretty lax
b	A.108 utt1	Yeah,
b	A.108 utt2	uh huh.
sv	B.109 utt2	and I think that's good because it does allow people to be individual
sv	B.109 utt3	and it allows you to kind of dress the way you feel that day.
b	A.110 utt1	Yes.
sv	B.111 utt1	Or, you know, if you want to be comfortable and casual you can,
sv@	B.111 utt2	and sometimes I think you may be more productive if you're comfortable with what your wearing and can be, feel more relaxed. * slash needed Whereas, sometimes when your in the suit and feel, kind of almost stiff and you know, maybe you don't, can't get as comfortable to sit down / * sv
b	A.112 utt1	Right.
sv	B.113 utt2	and, you know, like when I'm writing training material, I prefer to be more comfortable unless I know I have to meet with a customer later during the day.
b	A.114 utt1	Right,
b^r	A.114 utt2	right.
sv	B.115 utt1	So, I think, that is good that they're like that.
sv	B.115 utt2	I do know there's a lot of companies that are very strict about what the employees wear
sv	B.115 utt3	and they must wear blue or gray or black and a white shirt and, you know, no variation,
b	A.116 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.117 utt2	and I don't quite agree with that.
aa	A.118 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.118 utt2	well, I don't either.
sd	A.118 utt3	Fortunately I don't have to work in those companies .
aa	B.119 utt1	Right.
sd	A.120 utt1	But, I, did have a group come over from one of the banks, over the children's hospital where I was volunteering
sd	A.120 utt2	and, they were doing a presentation
sd	A.120 utt3	and every one of the young execs coming up were dressed exactly a like, men and women.
sd	A.120 utt4	They all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie.
sd@	A.120 utt5	I mean you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants. * need slash And one was a skirt and one was a pant. / * sd
b	B.121 utt1	right.
b	B.123 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.124 utt1	and I think that's sad because that doesn't allow for any individuality.
b	B.125 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.126 utt1	That can stifle creativity.
aa	B.127 utt1	Right,
aa	B.127 utt2	I agree.
sv^t	B.129 utt2	I guess we've talked probably long enough.
sv^t	A.130 utt1	I guess so,
fc	A.130 utt2	well it's been nice talking with you.
fc	B.131 utt1	Nice talking to you too,
fc	B.131 utt2	I enjoyed it.
fc	A.132 utt1	Uh huh,
fc	A.132 utt2	bye, bye.
fc	B.133 utt1	Bye, bye.
