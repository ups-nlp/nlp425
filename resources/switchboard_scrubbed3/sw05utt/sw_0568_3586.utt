fa	A.1 utt1	I'm sorry,
bd	B.2 utt1	That's okay,
sd^c	B.2 utt2	I didn't hear.
sd	A.3 utt1	hobbies.
b	B.4 utt1	Okay.
^h	A.5 utt1	Let me see,
sd^t	A.5 utt2	I don't know if that took or not,
cc^t	A.5 utt3	I'll do it again.
b	B.6 utt1	Okay.
qw	A.7 utt2	What are your hobbies?
qy^g	A.7 utt3	I hear you have kids, right?
sd	B.8 utt1	You heard her in the background .
sd	B.8 utt2	That's babies.
qy^g	A.9 utt1	That's your full time, hobby, right?
na	B.10 utt1	Takes a lot of time,
sd	B.10 utt2	I like, most sports.
sd	B.10 utt3	I like to do that.
sd	B.10 utt4	I kind of like to do a little bit of sewing.
b	A.11 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.12 utt1	little bit of embroidery work, once in a while.
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
qo	B.14 utt1	What do you like to do?
sd	A.15 utt1	I try to do some painting, although I'm not very good at it .
ba	B.16 utt1	Well, I'm sure you probably are.
bd	A.17 utt1	Well, no,
bd	A.17 utt2	not really.
sv	B.18 utt1	You like it,
sv	B.18 utt2	that's the main .
aa	A.19 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.19 utt2	I have, you know, I inherited the genes that make me think I'm creative, but not the ones that give me the ability to be.
aa	B.22 utt1	That's right.
sd	A.23 utt1	So, I always try.
sd	A.25 utt1	I do some sewing, mostly out of necessity.
sd	A.25 utt2	I'm making drapes for my house, just because I'm,
ba	B.26 utt1	boy, that's hard sewing.
aa	A.27 utt1	Yeah,
aap	A.27 utt2	well, it isn't and it is.
sd	A.27 utt4	actually the sewing isn't the hard part,
sv	A.27 utt5	it's just being able to lay out the material and measure it because you need so much room.
bf	B.28 utt1	Measure it and get it to,
aap	B.30 utt1	Well, it depends on how elaborate you get it.
sv	B.30 utt2	If you get pleats and all kinds of,
aa	A.31 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.31 utt2	I've been doing that
ba	B.32 utt1	That's a lot of work.
aa	A.33 utt2	yeah,
sd	A.33 utt4	but usually have to do the pleats by hand.
sd	A.33 utt5	So that, at least I can do, you know, watching T V or whatever
b	B.34 utt1	Oh.
b	B.36 utt1	Right,
b	B.36 utt2	right.
b	A.37 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.37 utt2	and I've gone and, you know, put the needle through my thumb a few times , trying to get it through
ba	B.40 utt1	That feels really good.
aa	A.41 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.41 utt2	so that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything, but I need to do it.
aa^m	B.42 utt1	To do it,
aa	B.42 utt2	right.
sd	A.43 utt1	let's see, I have a dog, and a lot of fish.
sd	A.43 utt2	Keeping fish, I guess is my biggest hobby.
b^m	B.44 utt1	Keeping fish .
sv	B.46 utt1	Well, they're probably easier than keeping dogs, though, aren't they.
aap	A.47 utt1	yes and no.
sd	A.47 utt2	It depends on how frequently they die, and how much that bothers you.
ba	B.48 utt1	no.
b^m	B.50 utt1	How much that bothers you,
sv	B.50 utt2	and you probably have to clean out the tank too.
arp	A.51 utt2	you don't have to do as much as I thought.
sd	A.51 utt4	I had fish as a kid
sd	A.51 utt5	and they always died immediately,
ba	B.52 utt1	no.
sv	A.53 utt2	and, what I think now is the reason is I kept the tank too clean
ba	B.54 utt1	you're kidding
bf	B.56 utt1	because they need to have a little bit of the,
aa	A.57 utt1	Right,
sv	A.57 utt2	you need to let the bacteria build up,
sv	A.57 utt3	and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance.
b	B.58 utt1	I see.
sd	A.59 utt1	And I would just take everything out and just like, you know, wash it with scalding hot water
ba	B.60 utt1	no.
sd	A.61 utt1	and it would kill all the bacteria,
sd	A.61 utt2	and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again
bf	B.62 utt1	And so you'd have to start all over to build that up probably.
aa	A.65 utt1	Right.
aa	A.67 utt1	That's right.
sd	A.67 utt2	So now I only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing
aa	B.68 utt1	Right,
aa	B.68 utt2	right.
sd	A.69 utt1	and I don't try and sterilize things .
bf	B.70 utt1	Don't go through the whole nine yards
sv	B.70 utt2	and they kind of need a little bit of that.
aa	A.71 utt1	That's right.
aa	A.73 utt1	That's right.
bf	B.74 utt1	So you've had fish for a long time.
sd	A.75 utt2	I guess it's been two years now I've had a tank here,
sd	A.75 utt3	and then back at home I used to have a small, you know, five gallon tank.
sd	A.75 utt4	But that never worked well.
qw	B.76 utt1	What size do you have now?
ba	B.78 utt1	that's a good size.
sd	A.79 utt1	It's a lot easier.
qy	B.80 utt1	Have you ever had it, crack or break or leak.
nn	A.81 utt1	No .
nn	A.83 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.83 utt2	not yet.
sv	B.84 utt1	Fifty five gallons, you'd hope it would never do that.
aa	A.85 utt1	That's right,
sd	A.85 utt2	I really do.
qy	B.86 utt1	Do you have all kinds of different fish
ny	A.87 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.87 utt2	I just have, you know, what they call community fish guppies, and platies and basic things.
b	B.88 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.89 utt2	I don't get into the
^2	B.90 utt1	Real exotic.
aa	A.91 utt1	right,
aa	A.91 utt2	right.
sd	A.91 utt3	The expensive ones.
sv	B.92 utt1	Well, they're probably harder to take care of
aa	A.93 utt1	They are.
sd	A.93 utt2	They're very expensive
sv	A.93 utt3	and, you know, when they die it's more like an investment.
b	B.94 utt1	Yes,
ba	B.94 utt2	I bet it is.
sv	A.95 utt1	You lost an investment
qy	B.96 utt1	Do you have problems with the fish eating each other?
nn	A.97 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.97 utt2	not really.
sd	A.97 utt3	Only if there's baby fish.
b	B.98 utt1	Right.
sd	A.99 utt1	You always have to isolate those.
qw	B.100 utt2	how do you isolate them?
sd	A.101 utt1	You get a
qy^d	B.102 utt1	A jar or something
nn	A.103 utt1	well, no,
sd^e	A.103 utt2	they have breeders.
bk	B.104 utt1	Okay.
sd	A.105 utt1	It's a little plastic things that sort of floats
b	B.106 utt1	Okay.
sd	A.107 utt1	and you put the mother fish in there
sd	A.107 utt2	and then it's got like a trough underneath her
b	B.108 utt1	Okay.
sd	A.109 utt1	so as the babies come out they fall down in the trough
sd	A.109 utt2	and there's a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber so the mother can't get to them either.
b	B.110 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.111 utt3	it kind of works,
sd	A.111 utt4	but it's also got slots in it so the water can circulate
b	B.112 utt1	Right.
sd@	A.113 utt1	and on occasion if you get a real small one, / * slash error; one utt with utt2
sd	A.113 utt2	it'll fit out the slots.
bf^m	B.114 utt1	It'll go through the slot.
aa	A.115 utt1	That's right,
sd	A.115 utt2	But, you know, it works, I guess.
qy^d	B.116 utt1	That works all right then.
bf	B.116 utt2	They don't, want the mothers to be with the little fish either.
sd	A.117 utt1	they'll eat them.
qy^d	B.118 utt1	They will.
ny	A.119 utt1	Yeah.
qy	B.120 utt1	Isn't that odd.
ny	A.121 utt1	Yes.
sv	B.122 utt1	You wouldn't think that.
sd	A.123 utt1	and it's funny because the one I have, every single month without fail she has babies.
ba	B.124 utt1	You're kidding.
aa	A.125 utt1	no.
sd	A.125 utt2	All the time,
sd	A.125 utt5	her variety, it says they won't eat the babies,
sd	A.125 utt6	and I've seen her do it.
qy^g	B.126 utt1	And that just makes you sick almost, doesn't it?
sd	A.127 utt2	well, it makes you understand that, you know, things are different .
bf	B.128 utt1	Things are different in the animal kingdom,
sd	A.129 utt1	right. We might decide what's proper and what isn't,
sv	A.129 utt2	but you know, that's the way it is for them.
b	B.130 utt1	Yeah.
bf	B.132 utt1	That's kind of the way they do it.
aa	A.133 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.133 utt2	That's it.
bf	B.134 utt1	Survival of the fittest or something.
aa	A.135 utt1	Yes,
sd	A.135 utt2	because if the baby is strong enough, it can swim away fast enough and go hide.
b	B.136 utt1	Right.
bf	B.138 utt1	Go hide from them,
qh	B.138 utt2	well and then, you think, well, how did they do it out in the real world anyway when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are kind of trying to keep up with that,
b	A.141 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.143 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.143 utt2	yeah.
qy^d	B.144 utt2	but. If you're like me, you never have enough time for the hobbies.
nn	A.145 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.145 utt2	not really.
sd	A.147 utt1	I try.
sd	A.147 utt2	I play a couple of instruments.
