sd	A.1 utt2	guess we got our first, credit card, back in the early seventies when, I first got married
b	B.2 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.3 utt2	was a Visa card. issued out of a Liberty Bank in Oklahoma City,
b	B.4 utt1	Uh huh
sd	A.5 utt1	because my sister worked at the some Bank Americard center there. / * one utt with a.3 utt2?
b	B.6 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.7 utt1	So, we were still in college
sd	A.7 utt2	and had she not worked there I'm not sure that I would have qualified.
sd	A.9 utt1	They've come in handy over the years.
b	B.10 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.11 utt1	and they have become, also a real bother sometimes.
ba	B.12 utt1	tell me about it .
sv	A.13 utt1	Especially, you know, if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation, it's just easier to put everything on a card.
b	B.14 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.16 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.17 utt1	And, I find if you're not careful you wind up, a month or so, staring those bills in the face
sd(^q)	A.17 utt2	and you go I don't remember doing all that stuff
sv	A.17 utt3	and it adds up.
aa	B.18 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.18 utt2	they add up quick .
sd	A.19 utt1	So, sometimes, especially traveling with T I, you know, everything goes on American Express,
b	B.20 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.22 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.23 utt1	and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping.
b	B.24 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.25 utt1	But, as far as personal life goes, I guess, I really try to use them as little as possible,
sd	A.27 utt1	I kind of like having them for, gasoline purchases.
aa	B.28 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.28 utt2	we like to keep one on hand just for emergencies, you know.
b	A.29 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.29 utt2	But other than that, I guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome, of just putting everything on there day after day after day
b	B.30 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.31 utt2	and then, then you really get socked to it, if you don't watch it.
b	B.32 utt1	Yeah.
qo	A.33 utt2	how do you look at counting credit cards?
sd	B.34 utt1	We just, quit using them .
sd	B.36 utt1	And they got us in trouble,
sd	B.36 utt2	we took a loan and paid them all off.
sd	B.36 utt3	we keep, one gas card and, Visa just, you know, in case there's an emergency or, something
b	A.37 utt1	Right.
sd	B.38 utt2	but other than that we don't use them anymore .
sd	A.39 utt1	Well, that's kind of the way we were doing
b	B.40 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.42 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.43 utt2	well, if you got a bunch of cards, you get a bunch of bills every month
b	B.44 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.45 utt2	and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid.
aa	B.46 utt1	I know,
bh	B.46 utt2	isn't that funny?
ny	A.47 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.49 utt2	maybe they're not really concerned about getting paid
sd	A.49 utt4	know if you don't, then they're adding on, what, eighteen, nineteen, twenty percent.
sd	A.51 utt2	Sometimes, it's twenty two percent interest.
b	B.52 utt1	Yeah.
aa	B.54 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.54 utt2	and then some of them add late fees on it, if they don't get paid
b	A.55 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.57 utt1	I guess that's one of the motivations behind the, the, the, American Express card with T I,
b	B.58 utt1	Uh huh.
br	B.62 utt1	Huh?
sd	A.63 utt1	with the American Express card from T I, there's no, late fee,
b	B.64 utt1	Uh huh .
sd	A.65 utt2	there's no, interest rate,
bh	B.66 utt1	really?
sd	A.67 utt1	you either pay the thing off
sd	A.67 utt2	or they come get it.
sd	A.69 utt1	And it's turned into personnel
sd	A.69 utt2	and they come get you .
sv	A.71 utt1	So, they've got quite a bit more motivation I think to get paid then, some of the others do.
b	B.72 utt1	yeah.
b	B.74 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.75 utt1	But that's the one that your call center manager sees every month,
b	B.76 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.77 utt1	so, you're a little bit more careful about what you put on that, even though you can use it however you want to.
ny	A.81 utt1	yeah.
br	B.82 utt1	you can?
sd^e	A.83 utt1	You can use it like any other card,
b	B.84 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.85 utt1	and, but, you know, you kind of, you know that somebody every month,
bk	B.86 utt1	I see,
sd	A.87 utt2	and who knows how many people, are looking at those, bills that come in, and those statements,
b	B.88 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.90 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.91 utt1	you're not the only one.
b	B.92 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.93 utt1	So, you want to make sure that, is that okay,
sd	A.93 utt2	is that okay, that those people see what it is that you are buying,
b	B.94 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.95 utt1	and most of the time it is.
sd	A.97 utt1	But, most of the others I've sent back, I mean, all you get is card offers, / * two utts
sd	A.97 utt2	I've got three card offers now, from gas companies and, Visa Gold and, some, , other bank,
b	B.98 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.99 utt2	Citibank I think is always sending the Visa stuff out.
sd	A.99 utt3	And I usually just throw them away because I, I don't want another one,
aa	B.100 utt1	I do too,
sd	B.100 utt2	I don't even open them much,
sd	B.100 utt3	I throw them out.
sd	A.101 utt2	I don't want to have to mess with it.
sd	A.101 utt3	You know you carry around a wallet full of credit cards,
b	B.102 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.103 utt1	and, one of these days it's going to all be full.
sd	B.104 utt1	A girlfriend of mine found a,
sd	B.104 utt2	it was a Visa or MasterCard,
sd	B.104 utt3	she found an ad for one in like a GOOD HOUSEKEEPING magazine for eleven percent.
ba	A.105 utt1	that's not bad.
sd	B.106 utt1	shoot I need one of those .
b	A.107 utt1	Yeah.
^h	A.107 utt2	No,
sd	A.107 utt3	if they don't say, no annual membership on them, I'll throw them away.
b	B.108 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.110 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.112 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.113 utt1	and then they started charging, annual membership fees,
sd	A.113 utt2	and I said, adios, you know, I'm not paying you,
qw	B.114 utt1	Why do they do that?
sv	A.115 utt1	It's just another way to make money, as far as I can tell.
sv	B.116 utt1	I mean, I mean they get enough, you know, on the interest .
ba	A.119 utt1	Well, sure.
sv	A.119 utt2	And I guess, they figure they've got enough people out there with cards,
sv	A.119 utt3	they're going to get cards at twenty bucks a pop.
b	B.120 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.122 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.123 utt1	There's going to be that much more.
b	B.124 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.125 utt1	so, then a couple years ago I found, a bank here in Plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was, you can get a Visa card through them and no annual membership.
b	B.126 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.127 utt1	So, I went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my son's savings account, in his name, and got my Visa card,
sd	A.127 utt2	so, as long as they have no annual membership fee, it would be okay,
b	B.128 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.131 utt2	but I can't see paying someone to use their card.
aa	B.132 utt1	No,
aa	B.132 utt2	I can't either.
sv	A.133 utt1	Be charged their eighteen percent interest,
b	B.134 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.135 utt2	I think you're right.
sv	A.135 utt3	The best philosophy is have them if you need them, but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere.
aa	B.136 utt1	Yeah,
aa	B.136 utt2	really.
b	A.137 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.138 utt1	gets a lot of people in trouble .
aa	@A.139 utt1	Yeah,
aa	@A.139 utt2	it sure does.
sv	@A.139 utt3	Maybe they're counting on that,
h	@A.139 utt4	I don't know.
sd^t	@A.139 utt5	Well, I guess that's it.
aa	B.140 utt1	Okay.
fc	A.141 utt1	Thanks for talking.
fc	B.142 utt1	Nice talking to you.
fc	A.143 utt1	Bye.
fc	B.144 utt1	Bye bye.
