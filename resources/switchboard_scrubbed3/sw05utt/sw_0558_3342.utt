sd	A.1 utt1	not be a very good conversationalist on fishing.
sd	A.1 utt2	I don't do a lot of it.
sd	B.2 utt1	Well, I do love to fish.
ba	A.3 utt1	Well good,
sv	A.3 utt2	maybe I can learn something.
arp	B.4 utt1	Well, I don't know how much you can learn.
sd	B.6 utt1	I'm not so sure I'm good at it,
sd	B.6 utt2	but I do enjoy doing it.
qy	A.7 utt1	Do you?
ny	B.8 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.9 utt1	Well, it is fun, what little I do.
h	A.9 utt2	Of course, I don't, you know,
sd	A.9 utt3	I think when they refer to different kinds of fishing
sd	A.9 utt4	I told my husband last night when I had called and they had, told me that this was a topic, I said, well, I can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm .
sd(^q)	A.9 utt5	He said, I don't think that's the different kinds of fishing they're talking about .
sd	B.10 utt1	Well, I hope it is,
sd	B.12 utt1	there's not a whole lot of different kinds.
sd	A.13 utt1	That's about the only kind I know how to do.
sd	B.14 utt1	I don't do a lot of deep sea fishing,
sd	B.14 utt2	because I get seasick,
sd	B.14 utt3	but we have a lot of lakes here in this area
b	A.15 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.17 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.18 utt1	and I do a lot of fishing for, bass.
sd	B.18 utt2	We have a couple of lakes in our area that are just filled with good sized bass.
b	A.19 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.20 utt1	And then when I get tired of them outwitting me, I fish for catfish
b	A.21 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.22 utt1	and we use worms and shiners, which is pretty much like minnows a little bit bigger than minnows,
b	A.23 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.24 utt2	and then I also use spinner baits and plastic worms.
b	A.25 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.26 utt1	It all depends on what I'm fishing for, and the time of day.
bf	A.27 utt1	Well, it sounds like you do quite a bit of it.
aa	B.28 utt1	I do.
sd	B.28 utt2	there's a lake like maybe two or three miles from here,
sd	B.28 utt3	and it's very convenient on afternoons when I want to just get away and sit and think.
b	A.29 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.30 utt2	Fishing's a good way to do that,
sd	B.30 utt3	and I have a lot of friends who like to go fishing.
qy	A.31 utt1	Do you have a boat?
nn	B.32 utt1	No,
sd^e	B.32 utt2	I don't.
sd	B.32 utt3	I have a friend who has a little inflatable raft,
sd	B.32 utt4	and we use that sometimes.
b	A.33 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.35 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.36 utt1	I wish I had a boat,
sd	B.36 utt2	but I don't.
sd	A.37 utt1	I think the lakes are probably different in Michigan than they are in Texas.
sd	A.37 utt2	The ones around here are so big, that you can fish off the dock
b	B.38 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.39 utt1	but unless you have a boat you can't really get into where they call the good fishing holes, you know.
b	B.40 utt1	Right.
qy^g	B.40 utt2	That's the same way here, isn't it?
qy	A.41 utt1	Is it?
na	B.42 utt1	You have to get back in the sticks in the,
b	A.43 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.43 utt2	My in laws live on a lake, a little bit east of Dallas, kind of in the Piney Woods,
sd	A.43 utt3	and the lake is beautiful,
sd	A.43 utt4	and I like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish,
sd	A.43 utt5	but actually catching fish to eat per se, you don't really do much of that right there.
sd	A.43 utt6	I catch a lot of little old, I think they call them perch
aa	B.44 utt1	Right.
sd	A.45 utt1	and then the, turtles try to eat up all my bait .
b	B.46 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.47 utt1	So it's so close to the dock that I think all I do is feed them a little bit
sd	B.48 utt1	We don't have, We don't have a big problem with turtles,
sd	A.49 utt1	but it's kind of fun.
sd	B.50 utt2	but we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes.
sd	A.51 utt1	 I would be afraid of that.
sd	B.52 utt1	And I, Well, I can't think of a time that I've been fishing that I haven't run into one or two of them.
qy	A.55 utt1	Do they ever get on your hook?
nn	B.56 utt1	No,
sd	B.56 utt3	occasionally I'll catch an eel on a hook, but never the snakes.
b	A.57 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.59 utt1	Are they poisonous snakes?
sd	B.60 utt1	we have a lot of cotton mouth,
ny	B.60 utt2	so yes
sd^e	B.60 utt3	they are, definitely
b	A.61 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.62 utt1	and they live in little coves that I like to fish in,
sd	B.62 utt2	so I seem them swimming by every once in a while.
b	A.63 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.63 utt2	I think I'd be a little bit afraid of those.
b	B.64 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.64 utt2	they're, they're certainly ugly.
b	A.65 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.65 utt2	We, saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in laws' place last year.
sd	A.65 utt3	It was probably four inches in diameter or something like that you know.
sd	A.65 utt4	Great big snake,
sd	A.65 utt5	and of course, it scared the women to death, you know,
sd(^q)	A.65 utt6	but the men come out and said well, that's only a king snake, it won't really hurt you, you know.
sd	A.65 utt7	But it looked so bad
b	B.66 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.67 utt1	and it was so big, that it might not would have hurt us,
sd	A.67 utt2	but we sure felt like it was hurting us, just being there, you know .
aa	B.68 utt1	Definitely.
sv	A.69 utt1	But they're scary looking.
qy	B.70 utt1	Do you have bass?
ny	A.71 utt1	Yes,
sd^e	A.71 utt2	I think that, probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else.
b	B.72 utt1	Right.
sd	B.72 utt2	Well, that's pretty much the same way here.
b	A.73 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.75 utt1	Now, they have a lot of bass tournaments.
sd	B.76 utt1	Well, we have those.
b	A.77 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.78 utt1	inevitably, if I enter one of those, I never catch a thing.
ba	A.79 utt1	no.
sd	B.80 utt1	I just go out there and sit and watch other people do it.
b	A.81 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.81 utt3	we've never entered a tournament or anything.
sd	A.81 utt4	We're not that big into fishing,
sd	A.81 utt5	but I see a lot of people,
sd	A.81 utt6	you know, early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out,
sd	A.81 utt7	and they'll say, Well, there's a big bass tournament this weekend,
sd	A.81 utt8	and all those people are here for the tournament, you know.
ba	B.82 utt1	yes.
sv	A.83 utt1	So I think there's a lot of people that have, you know, I guess that you'd call it really sport fishing,
sv	A.83 utt2	they're really into it to try to win.
aa	B.84 utt1	Yeah,
aa	B.84 utt2	definitely.
sd	B.86 utt1	Certainly here they are.
sv	A.87 utt1	But it's a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out on the water and looking around.
sv	A.87 utt2	The peace and calmness is really relaxing.
aa	B.88 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.88 utt2	it's a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and fish.
b	A.89 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.90 utt1	That's what I do a lot.
sd	A.91 utt1	I've never tried taking a book with me.
sd	A.91 utt2	I'll have to try that one of these days.
