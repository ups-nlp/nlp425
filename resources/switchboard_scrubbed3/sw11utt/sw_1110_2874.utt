qy^g	B.1 utt1	So you like to fish,
ny	A.2 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.2 utt2	I like to,
sd	A.2 utt3	I don't have a boat,
sd	A.2 utt4	but I like to fish
sd	A.2 utt5	and there's a lot of lakes around here.
qy	A.2 utt6	are there many lakes up there?
ny	B.3 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.3 utt2	actually there are quite a bit of lakes around me.
sd	B.3 utt3	we have those little, the, the, the Great Lakes, you know,
sd	B.3 utt5	Lake Ontario is right near here.
b	A.4 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.5 utt1	Plus, we're in what's called the Finger Lake Region of New York
sd	B.5 utt2	where there're lots of small lakes everywhere
sd	B.5 utt3	and these are, real good, for, like, you know, bass fishing and so forth.
qy^d	A.6 utt1	They have mostly small mouth in them
nn	B.7 utt1	No,
sd^e	B.7 utt2	we have qui , actually quite a lot of variety.
sd	B.7 utt4	we have large mouth, small mouth, sort of musky, pike, stuff like that.
b	A.8 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.9 utt1	You know, all sorts of fun stuff like that.
sd	B.9 utt2	we have a pretty large bass masters tournament actually takes place right on Lake Ontario every year.
b	A.10 utt1	yeah,
ba	A.10 utt2	that's right,
b	A.10 utt3	uh huh.
sd	B.11 utt1	So it's, that's, a lot of fun.
b	A.12 utt1	Uh huh.
qo	B.13 utt1	How about you?
qw	B.13 utt2	what do you like to go for?
sd	A.14 utt2	I fish for bass,
sd	A.14 utt3	but I hardly ever catch one,
sd	A.14 utt4	but, they have a tail race over in Lake Lavon
b	B.15 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.16 utt1	and, you know, when they open up the dam and let out water, they wash down the fish
sd	A.16 utt2	and, you catch that white bass and crappie out of there.
sd	A.18 utt1	Every once in a while there'll be striped bass.
sd	B.19 utt1	We have, some friends who live on the lake
b	A.20 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.21 utt1	and, the lake it just seems, is completely filled with bass to the point where, you know, normally you y , y , go fishing for bass, you get a lot of sunfish, or cat or whatever, and some other strange stuff. / * listen
sd	B.21 utt2	But in this particular lake, we went out with some friends, once
sd	B.21 utt3	and every time you tossed the line in, you pull up a five, six, seven inch minimum bass
sd	B.21 utt4	and usually you pull up, you know, thirteen to fourteen inch bass.
ba	A.22 utt1	Wow.
aa	B.23 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.23 utt2	it's a real enjoyable experience to go fishing there because we pull up, you know, bass after bass
o@	B.23 utt3	and, * slash error During perch season as well, you pull up a lot of, / * slash error
b	A.24 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.25 utt2	probably during perch season the perch will run in very large schools,
sd	B.25 utt3	so what they'll do is j ,
sd	B.25 utt4	you'll be sort of boating around,
sd	B.25 utt5	these people own a little row boat,
sd	B.25 utt6	and they'll be boating around
sd	B.25 utt7	and they'll hit a school of perches in the middle
b	A.26 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.27 utt1	and when they do, you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one at,
sd	B.27 utt2	they just drop it in.
sd	B.27 utt3	They can't pull it in fast enough.
qw	A.28 utt1	what do you catch perch on?
sd	B.29 utt2	according to them, when the perch are running, you can catch them on just about anything.
b	A.30 utt1	Huh.
sd	B.31 utt1	They tend to use, I guess worms or some kind of lures sometimes,
sd	B.31 utt2	but, you know, I've,
sd	B.31 utt3	she told me that they will sometimes use corn or anything, you know.
b	A.32 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.33 utt2	corn or salami or bread or anything,
sd	B.33 utt3	they'll, they'll hit because they're just sort of surrounded, these large schools.
b	A.34 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.34 utt3	sometimes I use corn,
sd	A.34 utt4	but, some fish steal it off the hook sometimes.
aa	B.35 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.35 utt2	it's a big problem.
aa	A.36 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.36 utt2	the other day I was fishing with bread,
sd	A.36 utt3	there's a college across the street
b	B.37 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.38 utt2	it's full of carp and, I caught a carp on a, about, what size is that, I think it was a number two treble hook,
sd	A.40 utt1	and it's huge,
sd	A.40 utt2	its mouth was full of hooks.
ba	B.41 utt1	Wow.
sd	A.42 utt1	So he was in a bad way.
sd	A.42 utt3	he was fast.
qy	B.43 utt1	A big one?
ny	A.44 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.44 utt2	Well, it's, it was sixteen inches long.
ba	B.45 utt1	that's, that's a nice size carp.
ny	A.46 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.46 utt2	I think it was about a pound and a half, you know,
sv	A.46 utt3	but all they're good for is the fight.
sv	A.46 utt4	Boy they really don't want to come out of the water
sd	A.46 utt5	they, they zip through the water, you know,
sd	A.48 utt2	how your line goes, you know
b	B.49 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.50 utt1	and I thought, you know, that, I wasn't going to be able to get it in, because, the one I hooked just about ten minutes before, when I tried to raise it out of the water, it fell off,
sd	A.50 utt2	so it wasn't hooked very well.
sd	A.50 utt3	But, you know, I got it that far,
bf	B.51 utt1	that, that counts.
aa	A.52 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.52 utt2	that's what I said.
sd	A.52 utt3	That's what I told the guy.
sd	A.52 utt4	The guy was standing there
sd	A.52 utt5	and he laughed when it fell off
sd(^q)	A.52 utt6	and I said, that's a quick release, right there.
qy	B.53 utt1	do you, do you actually like the taste of f ,
qy	B.53 utt2	do you, like, eat the fish that you catch
qr	B.53 utt3	or are you more of a sport fisherman?
sd	A.54 utt1	catfish, yeah.
sd	A.54 utt2	But, I haven't eaten anything else, you know.
sd	A.54 utt4	my dad has a farm
sd	A.54 utt6	he has two ponds up there
sd	A.54 utt7	and my uncle has a pond upstream
sd	A.54 utt8	and there's a lot of crappie in there now.
sd	A.54 utt9	But, I think he's the only one that's, that's caught or, a big enough crappie to eat.
sd	A.54 utt10	But the catfish, you know, there's hundreds of them from like two to six pounds and, that,
ny	A.54 utt11	yeah.
b	B.55 utt1	Right,
sd	B.55 utt3	because I don't actually like fish.
sd	B.55 utt5	so when I fish, it's more for sport than anything else.
b	A.56 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.56 utt3	when you have to look in their eyes and, you know, hit them in the head or whatever, that's what you do with a catfish you know, because you have to sever their spinal cord.
aa	B.57 utt1	Right.
sv	B.59 utt1	and, and, and, and be careful you don't get stung.
b	A.60 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	A.60 utt2	yeah.
aa	B.61 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.61 utt2	I know it.
qy	B.61 utt3	Have you ever tried, deep sea fishing?
ng	A.62 utt1	not yet.
sd	A.62 utt2	My brother went off the coast of Maine,
h	A.62 utt4	I don't know,
b	B.63 utt1	Yeah.
qy*	A.64 utt1	that school up there? / * listen is there overlap?
sd	A.64 utt3	he said that it was just like that.
sd	A.64 utt4	They were throwing like, hell benders or, some other kind of treble hook lure
sd	A.64 utt5	and, each time they bring them in they'd have at least one,
sd	A.64 utt6	sometimes they've had you know, one on every hook.
b	B.65 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.65 utt2	I was out in Florida with a friend a while ago
sd	B.65 utt3	and we would go and just, drop you know, a, a two or three rig, two or three hooked rig as well down off a boat.
sd	B.65 utt4	We just dropped it down there
sd	B.65 utt5	and, the captain had, you know, some kind of sonar in the boat
b	A.66 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.67 utt1	so he'd maneuver us into a school of fish
sd	B.67 utt2	and you just drop it in and it just,
sd	B.67 utt3	you get one or two at a shot, you know
sv	B.67 utt4	and, It's a good deal, too.
b	A.68 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.69 utt2	it was a, like twenty dollars for six hours of fishing on some big charter boat.
ba	A.70 utt1	Wow.
sd	B.71 utt1	You know, and, and they'll clean your fish on a tip basis for you if you want.
b	A.72 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.72 utt2	down here it's like two hundred dollars a day.
sd	B.73 utt3	this, this was for a, you know, large,
sd	B.73 utt4	there were maybe thirty of us on the boat.
bf	A.74 utt1	A group party.
sd	B.75 utt2	we weren't all related, just, you know, thirty people off the shop in the boat there.
b	A.76 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.77 utt1	If you want to go on a boat alone, it's like two hundred dollars a day.
b	A.78 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.79 utt1	But this is great, because I think it was nineteen dollars for five hours and twenty dollars for six hours or something.
b	A.80 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.81 utt2	so you'd get to go out there for, for six hours and get a nice suntan and bring along some lunch and fish all day.
sv	B.81 utt3	It's really nice .
sv	B.81 utt4	It's real enjoyable.
b	A.82 utt1	Yeah.
sd^t	A.82 utt2	Well, I don't know if it's been five minutes yet or not.
sv	B.83 utt1	I think we're probably close, though.
aa	A.84 utt1	Yeah.
fc	A.84 utt2	It's nice talking to you.
fc	B.85 utt1	Nice talking to you, too.
fc	B.85 utt2	Good luck with fishing this season.
fc	A.86 utt1	Good luck.
fc	B.87 utt1	Bye bye.
fc	A.88 utt1	Bye bye.
