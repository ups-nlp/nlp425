o	B.1 utt1	Okay,
sd^t	B.1 utt2	well the topic is selecting care for the elderly.
b	A.2 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.3 utt1	And I don't have elderly parents, yet but not that far in the distant future.
qo	B.3 utt2	What about yourself?
sd	A.4 utt1	Well, my parents are both in their seventies.
sd	A.4 utt2	my mother and stepfather, and my father and stepmother are all in their seventies.
sd	A.4 utt3	And, my, father and stepmother are not in very good health.
sd	A.4 utt4	So this is something that is,
qy^d	B.5 utt1	A concern of yours right now.
ny	A.6 utt1	Yes,
sd^e	A.6 utt2	it is.
qy	B.7 utt1	are they living independently, right now?
ny	A.8 utt1	Yes,
sd^e	A.8 utt2	they are.
bk	B.9 utt1	Oh.
sd^r	A.10 utt1	They are.
qy	B.11 utt1	Have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that?
ng	A.12 utt1	Not for them, my mother and stepfather have, set up an arrangement where they have a large home and, two of my sisters and their families, one of them's husband and then all the children are living in this home.
sd	A.12 utt2	Its got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms
sd	A.12 utt3	and, they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen.
sd	A.12 utt4	and, my stepfather bought this thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care
sd	A.12 utt5	and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home.
ba	B.13 utt1	that sounds the ultimate.
sd	A.14 utt1	unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that could not be given in the home.
sv	B.15 utt1	Well, even at that point, most care can be given in the home.
ba	B.15 utt2	That sound like just an excellent solution.
qy^d	B.15 utt3	You must feel real good about that.
nd	A.16 utt1	Well, I felt good about it because that's my personal feeling also.
sd	A.16 utt2	I read a lot
sd	A.16 utt3	and then I know people then have visited nursing homes and, have had great, grandparents in the nursing homes
sd	A.16 utt4	and it was not a happy situation for any of them.
sd	A.16 utt5	and, we have a very active nursing home here in Plano that has, activities going all the time
sd	A.16 utt7	even the people that are wheelchair bound and really are incapacitated. Go and, participate in olympics
b	B.17 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.18 utt2	and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair that's held annually at a big mall here .
b	B.19 utt1	Right.
sd	A.20 utt1	You know, so there are a lot of activities going on all the time
sd	A.20 utt2	and this is a nursing home,
sd	A.20 utt3	it's not a senior citizens home.
sd	A.20 utt4	So that the people are really,
^2	B.21 utt1	Really in need of a nursing home.
aa	A.22 utt1	Right.
sd	A.22 utt2	They need, the nursing care,
b	B.23 utt1	Right,
b	B.23 utt2	uh huh.
sv	A.24 utt2	and, but it's a very expensive solution.
aa	B.25 utt1	Well, it's, you know,
sv	B.25 utt2	I think we just, you know, listen to, the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes.
sv	B.25 utt3	It's just a matter of finding, a good home.
b	A.26 utt1	Right.
b	A.28 utt1	Right.
sv	B.29 utt1	and then, of course, there is always the problem of being able to afford either of those solutions.
aa	A.30 utt1	Right.
aa	A.30 utt2	Uh huh.
sv	B.31 utt1	And that, I think is what is scary,
sv	B.31 utt2	and I also feel that that's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from. Is when people have to put people in a nursing homes
sv	B.31 utt3	and they really can not afford the best.
aa	A.32 utt1	Right.
sd	A.32 utt2	And that's right, well I took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation
sd	A.32 utt3	and, they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who had, apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating.
b	B.33 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.34 utt1	And, he apparently had not been in the home too long, just a week or so,
sd	A.34 utt2	but when the family came in to see him, they had not been made aware,
sd	A.34 utt3	I was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance
sd	A.34 utt4	and I overheard their conversation.
sd	A.34 utt5	And when the family walked in, his wife and daughter and son in law, they were not even aware of what had happened.
ba	B.35 utt1	goodness.
sd	A.36 utt1	So, I told them he strangled on some chicken
sd	A.36 utt2	and, the, the woman, the wife said he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that that would require chewing or, so, you know,
b	B.37 utt1	Oh.
ba	B.39 utt1	What a shame,
sv	B.39 utt2	they put him in the home so that he could be cared for
aa	A.40 utt1	Right.
aa^r	A.40 utt2	Right.
sv	B.41 utt1	and then they could have done that well at home.
sd	A.42 utt1	And then she was upset,
sd	A.42 utt2	he had on two different shoes, one of which was not even his.
sd	A.42 utt3	He had on a pair, of slacks,
b	B.43 utt1	Oh.
sd(^q)	A.44 utt2	and the wife said "these are not his slacks"
sd(^q)	A.44 utt3	and she said "I just took two pair over yesterday for him that were clean."
sv	B.45 utt1	You hear these stories, all the time.
b	A.46 utt1	Right.
aa	A.48 utt1	Right.
sd	A.48 utt2	Well, this was just something that I was, I witnessed to.
b	B.51 utt1	Right.
sd	A.52 utt1	and, at no point did anybody from the nursing home come in.
sd	A.52 utt2	And we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour .
b	B.53 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.54 utt1	And, with just a curtain, of course, between us and,
b	B.55 utt1	Right.
sd	A.56 utt1	they revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth,
sd	A.56 utt2	and he was definitely,
sd	A.56 utt3	just by looking at him and the way he acted, you could tell he was in need of nursing home care,
sd	A.56 utt4	but the family were all talking about, putting him in another home.
sd	A.56 utt5	They said he will not go back to that one.
ba	B.57 utt1	Well, good.
ba	B.59 utt1	Good,
sd	B.59 utt2	I'm glad they have a solution. To do that,
sd	A.60 utt1	I'm glad they the option.
aa	B.61 utt2	yes.
aa	B.61 utt3	I know.
sd	A.62 utt1	I would hate to be in a position where that was all I could afford
sd	A.62 utt2	and there was no choice.
aa	B.63 utt1	Exactly.
sd	B.63 utt2	my ex husband's grandmother had been in a nursing home now for, it must be seven, eight years,
sd	B.63 utt3	and, It's just her condition deteriorated instantly upon getting into that home.
ba	A.64 utt1	my.
sv	B.67 utt1	As the situation is so sad because it just takes all the dignity away from, from people who have been independent all their lives.
aa	A.68 utt1	Uh huh.
aa^r	A.68 utt2	Uh huh.
sd	B.69 utt2	Like this was a really neat vital woman
sv	B.69 utt3	and you get in a nursing home
sv	B.69 utt4	and the first thing that happens you have to share your whole living space, with someone that you have never known before in your life.
b	A.70 utt1	Right.
b	A.72 utt1	Right.
sd	B.73 utt1	And oh I do not know what the answer is,
sv	B.73 utt2	but I do know that there are some wonderful places out there
sv	B.73 utt4	a lot of it goes down to just money. And family support,
aa	A.74 utt1	That's right.
sv	B.75 utt2	if you, you know, have family that, you can live with.
sv	A.76 utt1	Visits everyday.
aa	B.77 utt1	Right.
aa^m	A.78 utt1	Right.
aa^m	B.79 utt1	Right.
sv	B.79 utt3	I think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care, you know.
sv	B.79 utt4	You would do your research
sv	B.79 utt5	and you would go visit.
b^m	A.80 utt1	Visit,
aa	A.80 utt2	right.
sv	B.81 utt1	And, hopefully, they would have it so that you could go there anytime.
b	A.82 utt1	Right.
sv	B.83 utt1	Because if you could not go there anytime, then that would make you, a little bit su ,
^2	A.84 utt1	Suspicious.
aa	B.85 utt2	right.
sd	A.86 utt1	{D You know, I, my, I remember my grandmother many years ago when she was in a nursing home before she died
sd	A.86 utt2	and I guess there was not a name for what she had at that time,
sd	A.86 utt3	but I guess Alzheimer's would come as close as anything,
sd	A.86 utt4	she really was not aware of what she was doing.
b	B.87 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.88 utt1	And, I can remember she had several strokes
sd	A.88 utt2	and the nursing home was right next to a hospital
sd	A.88 utt3	and they would rush her to the hospital and revive her and just bring her back to the nursing home in a couple of days.
sd	A.88 utt4	And she was, it was just like keeping something.
