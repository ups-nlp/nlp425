qy	A.1 utt1	Well, do you have any pets?
ny	B.2 utt1	Yes
sd^e	B.2 utt2	I do.
sd	B.2 utt3	I have a dog named Grisly, who's a ten year old, mixed breed between Golden Retriever, Afghan Hound and Chow.
bk	A.3 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.4 utt1	And I have a pair of box turtles.
sd	A.7 utt1	I used to have box turtles, well, years ago, when I was growing up
b	B.8 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.9 utt1	I really like them.
b	B.10 utt1	yeah,
sd	B.10 utt2	I do, too.
sd	B.10 utt3	Lucky and Spot, that's their names
b	A.11 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.12 utt1	and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room,
sd	B.12 utt2	and my dog thinks he's a mother turtle, and always has his nose all around my turtle box,
qy	B.14 utt2	so do you have any pets now?
ny	A.15 utt1	Yes,
sd^e	A.15 utt2	we have one dog, a Bichon Frise.
sd	A.15 utt3	our friends in Houston bred the dogs.
sd	A.15 utt4	I had never heard of them
nn	B.16 utt1	No,
sd	B.16 utt2	I haven't either.
sd	A.17 utt1	they're all white
sd	A.17 utt2	and they're small, and fluffy,
sd	A.17 utt3	they don't shed.
sd	A.17 utt4	I guess they're distantly related to a poodle,
sd	A.17 utt5	but they're not very well known in this country,
sd	A.17 utt6	and they're not, high strung or over bred 
b	B.18 utt1	Oh.
qw	B.20 utt1	And how big do they get.
sd	A.21 utt1	Ours is, on the small end,
sd	A.21 utt2	and she's about ten pounds,
sd	A.21 utt3	and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds
ba	B.22 utt1	that's interesting.
sd	A.23 utt1	and they love people, and kids
sd	A.23 utt2	and that was something we were looking for,
sd	A.23 utt3	our love is Golden Retrievers,
sd	A.23 utt4	and that's what we had intended to get in Houston,
sd	A.23 utt5	but we had a small yard and a pool
sd	A.23 utt6	and knowing how they love to dig and love the water, we thought that was kind of a tough climate
sv	B.24 utt2	the water,
b	B.26 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.27 utt1	so, we ended up getting this,
sd	A.27 utt2	and, my son would rather have a Golden Retriever, though, I think
b	B.28 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.29 utt1	now he wants a good size dog .
b	B.30 utt1	Uh huh,
sd	B.30 utt2	well, we've got a good size dog,
sd	B.30 utt3	and we were considering getting a puppy, a small house, lap top dog for him, because he likes other animals and because we used to have a miniature Dachshund,
sd	B.30 utt4	and I miss having a little one you know, around.
b	A.31 utt1	Oh.
b	A.33 utt1	Yeah.
ba	B.34 utt2	The kind you have sounds very interesting, though.
sd	A.35 utt1	Well, they're really sweet dogs.
sd	A.35 utt2	we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of, the family that had them and bred them.
sd	A.35 utt3	They had five litters of puppies,
sd	A.35 utt4	and and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood
b	B.36 utt1	Oh.
b	B.38 utt1	Uh huh.
qw	B.40 utt1	And how do you spell that breed?
sd	A.41 utt1	It's B I C H O N F R I S E.
b^m	B.42 utt1	F R I S E.
qw	B.42 utt2	And how do you pronounce that?
sd	A.43 utt1	Bichon Frise.
bk	B.44 utt1	Okay.
sd	B.44 utt2	I'm writing it out phonetically,
b	A.45 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.45 utt3	and they don't shed
sv	A.45 utt4	so they're good dogs for people with allergies,
b	B.46 utt1	Yes,
sd	A.47 utt2	and they love people,
qy	B.48 utt1	Do they bark a lot?
nn	A.49 utt1	no,
sd^e	A.49 utt2	not really.
sd	A.49 utt3	ours barks more than some, because she spent a lot of time at our friends house.
sd	A.49 utt4	We used to swap back and forth dogs.
sd	A.49 utt5	they have three dogs.
sd	A.49 utt6	They had a Cockapoo, and two Bichons 
b	B.50 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.51 utt2	and she didn't bark at all until she spent time there
bk	B.52 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.53 utt1	and, now it's funny.
sd	A.53 utt2	she's a good watch dog
b	B.54 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.55 utt1	and if there's, she'll bark that way,
sd	A.55 utt2	but she also talks a lot,
sd	A.55 utt3	she has a definite personality
b	B.56 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.57 utt2	and so, if we're leaving her, she barks at us, because she doesn't want to be left.
b	B.58 utt1	Oh.
qy	B.60 utt1	Does she ever mess in the house?
nn	A.61 utt1	No,
nn^r	A.61 utt2	no,
sd^e	A.61 utt3	and they're very smart dogs.
sd	A.61 utt4	The circuses in Europe used to use them for the acts.
b	B.62 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.63 utt2	they'll dance on their hind legs each
b	B.64 utt1	Uh huh.
ba	B.66 utt1	gee.
sd	A.67 utt1	but they're very easy to train
b	B.68 utt1	Uh huh.
qw	B.70 utt1	And about how much are they?
^h	A.71 utt2	I'd noticed up here they're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper.
sd	A.71 utt3	They run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars, I think which I thought was a lot.
qw	B.72 utt1	And how about the, And how about the person in, Houston?
nd	A.75 utt1	Well, she's no longer breeding them
bk	B.76 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.77 utt1	but, because her dogs, the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter,
sd	A.77 utt2	and, the one male that she used had a tooth problem
b	B.78 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.79 utt1	and so she only bred that dog once because it had the tooth problem, and did them strictly as, pets, you know they weren't show quality.
b	B.80 utt1	yes.
b	B.82 utt1	Just pets,
b	B.84 utt1	Yes,
sd	B.84 utt2	that's what we'd rather have is just a pet, instead of
b	A.85 utt1	Ri ,
sd	B.86 utt1	we used to show Saint Bernards when I was a little girl.
sd	B.86 utt2	We did that every weekend,
sv	A.87 utt1	but, yeah, takes a lot of time.
aa	B.88 utt1	Yes,
sv	B.88 utt2	and it's very expensive.
aa	A.89 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.89 utt2	but she might have some contacts here,
sd	A.89 utt3	I know that the dog's grandmother, was from Plano,
sd	B.90 utt1	that's where I live,
sd	A.91 utt1	that's where I live, too.
b	B.92 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.92 utt2	I'm at Coit and Legacy ...
