fp	A.1 utt1	Hi,
sd	A.1 utt2	my last, auto repair was my, alternator went out.
sd	A.1 utt3	I have a nineteen eighty six Toyota,
sd	A.1 utt4	it's a little Tercel .
b	B.2 utt1	Uh huh .
sd	A.3 utt1	And, I have a friend whose real good with, repairing cars
sd	A.3 utt2	so I got him to take the alternator off and take it and, you know, get a replacement part.
b	B.4 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.5 utt1	So we went to a, a place called Quality Auto Parts
sd	A.5 utt2	and their parts are supposed to be guaranteed and everything
sv	A.5 utt3	and they're, very reasonable.
sd	A.5 utt4	So, I bought the alternator,
sd	A.5 utt5	we put it on the car
sd	A.5 utt6	and it didn't work,
sd	A.5 utt7	and it blew out all the fuses.
ba	B.6 utt1	no .
b	A.7 utt1	Yeah.
qw	B.8 utt1	How much was the alternator?
sd	A.9 utt1	I bel , something like sixty nine dollars, something on that order.
qy	B.10 utt1	did he hook up the wiring wrong?
nn	A.11 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.11 utt2	he hooked it up right.
sd	A.11 utt3	it was just that the part just didn't fit the car,
sd	A.11 utt4	so. I took it back
sd	A.11 utt5	and, he took the alter , the guy in the parts shop took the alternator
sd	A.11 utt6	and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them
sd	A.11 utt7	and, he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator
sd	A.11 utt8	so we went back and tried it again, put it on again
sd	A.11 utt9	and it still didn't work,
sd	A.11 utt10	and we took the car up to, a little place called Pep Boys,
qy^d	A.11 utt11	I don't know if you have them in your area
ny	B.12 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.13 utt1	but, they're pretty reasonable, car repair place also.
sd	A.13 utt2	So, towed it up there because it, you know, wouldn't start or anything
sd	A.13 utt3	and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses and, took them about an hour to, figure out what was blowing the fuse,
sd	A.13 utt4	and it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse.
sd	A.13 utt5	Anyway, ended up taking it to the Toyota dealer
sd	A.13 utt6	and the only problem was that, it had to be a genuine Toyota, alternator because most of the other ones that they say will fit it, that, you know, they sit in there and everything
sd	A.13 utt7	but there's just some little difference that, causes it not to work an i ,
b	B.14 utt1	Uh huh,
sv	B.14 utt2	they probably built that in so they could make money.
aa	A.15 utt1	yeah,
aa	A.15 utt2	I guess so
sd	A.15 utt3	and that was my last experience.
sd	B.16 utt1	Well I had a weird,
sd	B.16 utt2	there's a little sensing device, I'm not sure, right in front of the fan,
sd	B.16 utt3	it's an air conditioner sensing device.
sd	B.16 utt4	I don't know why,
sd	B.16 utt5	it actually,
sd	B.16 utt6	there's a metal piece that fits through the belts,
sd	B.16 utt7	and somehow that broke off
sd	B.16 utt8	and, I still can't figure out how it broke,
sd	B.16 utt9	and, anyway, so this piece obviously,
sd	B.16 utt10	I have a Subaru,
sd	B.16 utt11	and, I think you can only get it through Subaru dealer, etcetera,
b	A.17 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.18 utt1	this little sensing device costed like sixty bucks .
ba	A.19 utt1	Goodness,
sd	B.20 utt1	and I haven't had too many problems with my car,
sd	B.20 utt2	I got a eighty eight Subaru, G L X T
b	A.21 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.22 utt1	and then, you know just basic maintenance and oil changes
sd	B.22 utt2	and I do not do my oil changes
sd	B.22 utt3	and I will not do my oil changes.
sd	B.22 utt4	I think the first time I tried to do one and ended up, trying to ge ,
sd	B.22 utt5	yo , borrowed somebody else's jack
sd	B.22 utt6	and I did this
sd	B.22 utt7	and I went and bought everything,
b	A.23 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.24 utt1	so after buying the filter and all the oil, you're looking at ten bucks at least, or somewhere in there and, and then to go to the trouble, that I figured it's easier spending eighteen bucks at Jiffy Lube.
b	A.25 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.27 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.28 utt2	as far as any maintenance on my car, I shy away from the oil changes,
ba	B.28 utt3	that's for sure.
b	A.29 utt1	Uh huh,
sd	A.29 utt2	well my car it's an eighty six
sd	A.29 utt3	and I really hadn't had any trouble with it until that
sd	A.29 utt4	and the car now has a hundred and thirty something thousand miles on it
sd	A.29 utt5	and this was just recent,
sd	A.29 utt6	so I really can't complain about this one.
qw	B.30 utt1	How did you put that many miles on it, in, four or five years?
sd	A.31 utt1	well, I used, I used to work,
sd	A.33 utt2	it was a seventy mile trip everyday, you know, two ways was seventy miles.
qy	B.34 utt1	a hundred and forty mile trip?
nn	A.35 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.35 utt2	it was just seventy miles.
bf	B.36 utt1	thirty five miles each way.
aa	A.37 utt1	Yeah.
b^m	B.38 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.39 utt1	And, I did that for about three years
sd	A.39 utt2	and it really added up.
sd	A.39 utt3	I've only taken, maybe two trips that were about four hours long down to Shreveport.
sd	A.39 utt4	And, the rest of it you know, it's just basically driving a long ways to work.
sd	A.39 utt5	And now I drive like twenty three miles each way,
sd	A.39 utt6	so, I'm getting a little, little relief,
sd	A.39 utt7	but still I drive a long ways.
b	B.40 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.41 utt1	But I guess because they're highway miles, you know, it's not so bad on your car as if it, you know, were just regular street, you know.
b	B.42 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	B.42 utt2	Do you work for T I?
ny	A.43 utt1	Yes
sd^e	A.43 utt2	I do.
bk	B.44 utt1	Okay.
qy	A.45 utt1	Do you?
qw^h	B.46 utt1	I was going to ask you, you know, as far as how we're getting compensated for what we're doing right now,
ng	B.46 utt2	I don't work for T I
sd	B.46 utt3	and I get these green,
sd	B.46 utt4	I don't know what you want to call them, fake point things,
^2	A.47 utt1	Points.
b	A.49 utt1	Uh huh.
qw^d	B.50 utt1	and, I just wondering how I go about getting the cash .
sd	A.51 utt1	there's a number that you call,
sd	A.51 utt2	it's the same number that you call to make a call.
bk	B.52 utt1	okay.
ad	A.53 utt1	you call that number
sd	A.53 utt2	and, somehow or another they'll give you an option to leave a message
ad	A.53 utt3	and you can leave a message.
aa	B.54 utt1	Okay.
sd	A.55 utt1	I know someone that did that,
ad	A.55 utt2	you leave a message
sd	A.55 utt3	and they'll call you back.
aa	B.56 utt1	Okay,
aa	B.56 utt2	all right,
ba	B.56 utt3	well that's good to know.
sd	B.56 utt4	I haven't been doing
sd	B.56 utt5	this is the first time I've been called in a long time
sd	B.56 utt6	and I haven't been doing it
b	A.57 utt1	really.
sd	B.58 utt1	And, I've done it maybe twelve times.
b	A.59 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.60 utt1	Well I don't know if I've done it quite that much,
sd	B.60 utt2	but, mine is mixed up too,
sd	B.60 utt3	I have to call and get it fixed .
sd	A.61 utt1	let's see before I had this car I bought an Audi five thousand
b	B.62 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.63 utt1	but I bought it used.
sd	A.63 utt2	I just bought it from a friend who just charged me what the dealer was going to give him for it for a trade in,
sd	A.63 utt3	and, it had a whole lot of miles on it.
sd	A.63 utt4	I figured maybe I'd get one or two years out of it,
sd	A.63 utt5	an I did get a couple of good years out of it
sd	A.63 utt6	and the engine messed up on me
sd	A.63 utt7	and then I gave it to a guy to repair who works for the Audi dealer
sd	A.63 utt8	and, he took the engine apart
sd	A.63 utt9	and, you know, he just said he couldn't fix it
sd	A.63 utt10	so the engine never got put back together again.
b	B.64 utt1	well.
sd	B.66 utt1	I was driving a sixty six Plymouth Fury.
ba	A.67 utt1	Wow.
sv	A.67 utt2	I think those old cars might be a pretty good bet because you ,
b	B.68 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.68 utt2	yeah,
sv	B.68 utt3	and, that's when they made cars, though,
h	A.69 utt2	I don't know, i ,
sd	B.70 utt2	the body was in good condition
sd	B.70 utt3	and you know, it ran fine.
sd	B.70 utt4	It was starting to burn some oil.
b	A.71 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.71 utt2	 Uh huh,
sd	B.72 utt2	you know, after about thr , couple of months after I was out of college I finally splurged and bought my car
sd	A.73 utt2	I read a book one time that said that the best cars were made before seventy four.
aa	B.74 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.74 utt2	well, you know, these cars made in the sixties and stuff,
sv	B.74 utt3	I mean I mean, the thickness,
sv	B.74 utt4	I mean, those thin , they're just,
sv	B.74 utt5	you just don't see cars like that.
b	A.75 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.76 utt1	And they last a long time.
sv	B.76 utt2	And they were simple too,
sv	B.76 utt3	the engines were simple and durable
sv	B.76 utt4	and some people will still buy them, you know,
b	A.77 utt1	Yeah.
aa	A.79 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.79 utt2	it's easy, I guess it's still easy to find engines for those cars, engines and transmissions
sv	A.79 utt3	and I guess if you keep changing them out you can keep a car for a long time.
sv	A.79 utt4	Course I guess I could do the same thing with the Toyota that I have,
sd	A.79 utt5	I just don't know how much they'll want to charge me to,
sv	B.80 utt1	It almost costs so much to fix anything or do anything with it,
sv	B.80 utt2	you're just better off buying another car.
aa	A.81 utt1	Yeah,
aa	A.81 utt2	I guess so,
sv	A.81 utt3	but I just think they cost too much in the first place, now a days.
