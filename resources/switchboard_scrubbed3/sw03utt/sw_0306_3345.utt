qy	A.1 utt1	Well, you keep up with current events?
na	B.2 utt1	somewhat.
na^r	B.2 utt3	somewhat
sd	B.4 utt1	not as well as I would like to probably
bh	A.5 utt1	Is that right?
sd	B.6 utt1	but that's the way it goes.
b	A.7 utt1	Yeah,
qw	A.7 utt2	whereabouts in Pennsylvania.
br	B.8 utt1	What?
qw	A.9 utt1	Where in Pennsylvania?
sd	B.10 utt1	State College,
sd	B.10 utt2	I go to Penn State.
bk	A.11 utt1	do you,
ba	A.11 utt2	well, great.
b	B.12 utt1	Yep.
ar	A.13 utt2	well no,
sd	A.13 utt3	we're not supposed to talk about that.
sd	A.13 utt4	We're supposed to talk about current events.
aa	B.14 utt1	Right,
aa	B.14 utt2	exactly,
sd	A.15 utt1	Well, I'm a current event junkie.
sd	A.15 utt2	So I watch, I try to watch the news,
sd	A.15 utt3	and I read the newspaper,
sd	A.15 utt4	and I like to read TIME magazine and PEOPLE magazine to keep up with what's going on in the world.
b	B.16 utt1	I see.
qw	B.18 utt1	Well, what particularly are you interested in?
sd	A.19 utt1	Well, I just, pretty, little, you know, about everything.
sd	A.19 utt2	And, not and then again not everything,
b	B.20 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.21 utt2	but you know, I like to know pretty well what's happening.
sd	A.21 utt3	Political things don't interest me a great deal, except I do like to stay informed enough to, feel like I halfway vote intelligently, you know
b	B.22 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.23 utt1	but, other than that, I just, you know,
sd	A.23 utt2	just the events that happen around the world interest me. Stay in touch with it and feel like I know what's going on.
b	B.24 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.25 utt2	Now I have to say all three of my children, none of them are too interested in current events.
b	B.26 utt1	I see.
sd	A.27 utt1	But I always have been
b	B.28 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.29 utt1	and I stay up with it.
qo	A.29 utt2	But, how do you, stay aware of most of the current events. newspaper? T V news, or what?
sd	B.30 utt1	 well, some of both.
b	A.33 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.34 utt1	I read the newspapers sometimes
b	A.35 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.36 utt1	and I watch C N N, that sort of thing occasionally
b	A.37 utt1	Right.
b	A.39 utt1	Yeah,
ba	A.39 utt2	that's good.
sd	B.40 utt1	and I read magazines, and such.
bf	A.41 utt1	Well, you stay up with it pretty well, then.
aa	B.42 utt1	Well, yeah,
sd	B.42 utt2	I mean, not that badly anyway,
b	A.43 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.44 utt2	so I am interested in what's going on,
sd	B.44 utt3	and I'm particularly interested in certain things of course, like all the news about Haiti recently because I've been down there
b	A.45 utt1	Uh huh,
b	A.45 utt2	yes,
b^r	A.45 utt3	uh huh.
bh	A.47 utt1	you've been there
ny	B.48 utt1	and, yeah.
sv	A.49 utt1	well, you would be interested in it then.
aa	B.50 utt1	Right,
aa	B.50 utt2	exactly.
b	A.51 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.51 utt2	I follow it, you know,
sd	A.51 utt3	I don't just read everything about it,
sd	A.51 utt4	but I'm always aware of what's going on like that
b	B.52 utt1	Yep,
sv	A.53 utt1	because it's interesting
b	B.54 utt1	Uh huh.
h	A.55 utt1	and, I don't know,
sd	A.55 utt2	I feel sorry for those people down there,
sv	A.55 utt3	they've just been so terribly mistreated for so many years, you know. I mean, through Papa Doc,
aa	B.56 utt1	That's true.
sv	B.58 utt1	They've never really had a good leader,
sv	A.59 utt2	I mean he was a terrible tyrant
b	B.60 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.62 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.63 utt1	and I think it's been better since he died,
sv	A.63 utt2	but it's still been bad
b	B.64 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.65 utt1	but, even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew,
sd	A.65 utt2	I've read some things about him that he wasn't too good himself.
bh	B.66 utt1	yeah?
ny	A.67 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.67 utt3	he didn't mind having people bumped off for certain things, you know.
b	B.68 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.69 utt1	But, It's, one of the reasons the U S you know, didn't do more than they did at the time because they weren't all that excited about him, although he's probably better than a lot of them,
b	B.70 utt1	I see.
b	B.72 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.73 utt3	those people are so used to it
sv	A.73 utt4	I guess it's the only thing that works.
b	B.74 utt1	Yeah,
qo	B.74 utt2	so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in America?
sv	A.75 utt1	I think it's pretty darned good,
sv	A.75 utt2	I think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have
b	B.76 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.77 utt1	I really do.
sv	A.77 utt2	Now, they sometimes they jump on it and, and go a little to the extreme,
sv	A.77 utt3	the media does,
sv	A.77 utt4	but, that's kind of understandable, because, you know, of course if you watch it more than once a day, I mean, it's the same thing over and over and over and over,
sd	A.77 utt5	and I listen to the radio
b	B.78 utt1	Right,
b^r	B.78 utt2	right.
sv	A.79 utt1	so you hear so much,
sv	A.79 utt2	you get a little tired of it,
sv	A.79 utt3	but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe
b	B.80 utt1	Yep.
sv	A.81 utt1	but I think the quality of our news is just, I don't believe it could be better
b	B.82 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.83 utt1	I really don't.
b	B.84 utt1	Yeah,
ar	B.84 utt2	well, you know, I think it always could be better,
aa	B.84 utt3	but I, would agree that it's pretty good.
ar	A.85 utt1	I don't think so.
sv	A.87 utt1	I don't think our news could be better.
b	B.88 utt1	Yeah.
qh	A.89 utt1	I mean, I mean, what else could they do to make it better.
sv	A.91 utt1	I don't see anything that they could do.
b	B.92 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.92 utt2	well, I think that,
h	B.92 utt3	I don't know.
sv	A.93 utt1	Well, you always want to think everything can be improved upon
aa	B.96 utt1	Right.
ba	A.97 utt1	I understand what you're saying,
aa	B.98 utt1	Right,
sd	B.98 utt2	I think that,
sv	A.99 utt1	But by trial and error over the years, I think they got it about as good as they're going to get it.
aa	B.100 utt1	Well, that may be so,
sv	A.101 utt1	 nothing is perfect.
sv	B.102 utt1	I think that I'm not always satisfied with how dig they deep into the how deep they dig into things and such.
b	A.105 utt1	Uh huh.
aa	A.107 utt1	Well, that's true,
ba	A.107 utt2	I understand what you're saying,
sd	A.107 utt3	and then again, I understand why they can't dig too much deeper,
sv	A.107 utt4	that's why we have C N N.
b	B.108 utt1	Right.
sv	A.109 utt1	C N N has the time, since that's all they do is news to dig deeper.
b	B.110 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.112 utt1	Right.
