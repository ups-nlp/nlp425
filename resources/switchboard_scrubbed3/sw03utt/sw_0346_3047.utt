ny	A.4 utt1	Yeah.
qw	B.5 utt1	How old is she?
sd	A.6 utt1	She's only about, a little less than two years old.
qy^d	B.7 utt1	I guess you have not reached the stage where you need to, promote a college or anything,
nn	A.8 utt1	No.
sd	B.9 utt1	I've got one that's seven and one that's three,
sd	B.9 utt2	so, we started saving,
sd	B.9 utt3	but that's all.
b	A.10 utt1	Yeah .
qy	B.11 utt1	So, is there, are you planning to, like, encourage your children to go to a particular school?
nn	A.12 utt1	, no,
nn	A.12 utt2	no particular school.
sv	A.12 utt3	I think that's really a decision that,
qy^d	B.13 utt1	That you are going to let them make.
nd	A.14 utt2	well, help them make in terms of, you know, what they are wanting to do.
b	B.15 utt1	Right.
b	B.17 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.18 utt1	You know, that's a big influence, I think and, You know not only what you can afford, but what's going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are.
aa	B.19 utt1	Yeah,
aa^r	B.19 utt2	yeah.
b	B.21 utt1	Right.
b	B.23 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.24 utt1	So, you know, you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do.
aa	B.25 utt1	Yeah.
qw	B.25 utt2	Where did you go to school?
sd	A.26 utt1	University of Mississippi.
bk	B.27 utt1	Oh.
qy	B.27 utt2	Was that local or,
sd	A.28 utt1	well, well, it was within the state.
b	B.29 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.30 utt1	But it was not necessarily local, it was,
b	B.31 utt1	Yeah.
qy	A.32 utt1	What's the criterion for choosing to go there?
ny	B.33 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.34 utt1	well, at the time, I was, thinking of going pre med
b	B.35 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.36 utt1	and in the state, they had the best pre med curriculum for the, state institutions.
b	B.37 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.38 utt1	It was choice between there and, a private college that, was a bit more expensive.
b	B.39 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.41 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.42 utt1	At the time, we really could not afford it
sd	A.42 utt2	so I ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me.
b	B.43 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.44 utt3	I enjoyed it.
qy	B.45 utt1	So did you commute everyday then
nn	A.46 utt1	No.
bk	B.47 utt1	okay.
nn	A.48 utt1	No,
nn^r	A.48 utt2	no,
sd^e	A.48 utt3	it was a six hour drive.
bk	B.49 utt1	okay,
sd	B.49 utt2	when you said it was quite a way away, I did not know that meant you had to drive like an hour
sd	A.50 utt1	it was like another world.
b	B.51 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.52 utt1	Basically, no it was a,
sd	A.52 utt2	did not get home that often, you know,
sv	A.52 utt3	and at that age it's kind of difficult sometimes.
b	B.53 utt1	Yeah.
b	B.55 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.56 utt1	Especially, if you have not been away a lot that extended .
b	B.57 utt1	Yeah.
qy	B.59 utt1	So, did you go there, like, straight out of high school?
ny	A.60 utt1	Yeah.
b^m	B.61 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.61 utt2	see I did not get my degree until later on,
sd	B.61 utt3	so I just finished mine a couple of years ago.
b	A.62 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.63 utt1	And, you know, I guess, you know, when you have to do it that way, it makes your choices a lot easier
aa	A.64 utt1	that's true.
aa	A.64 utt2	Yeah,
sd	A.64 utt3	that's like, you know, when I went on to get my masters you know, it was where I was at the time.
b	B.65 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.67 utt1	Right.
sd	A.68 utt1	You know, I was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else because I was pretty much settled
b	B.69 utt1	Right,
b^r	B.69 utt2	right.
sd	A.70 utt2	and I was trying to work.
sv	A.70 utt3	so when you are first going to school you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go.
aa	B.71 utt1	Exactly.
b	B.73 utt1	Yeah.
qw	B.73 utt2	which group do you work in in T I?
sd	A.74 utt1	the computer science center.
qw	B.75 utt1	where is that at?
sd	A.76 utt1	north building.
bk	B.77 utt1	I see.
qw	B.77 utt2	How long do you work for T I?
sd	A.78 utt1	about three years.
qy	B.79 utt1	Did you work somewhere else,
bf	B.79 utt2	like sounds like you got your masters before here
ny	A.80 utt1	yeah,
sd^e	A.80 utt2	I have,
ar	A.80 utt3	no
sd	A.80 utt4	actually, I mean I came straight from school to here.
bk	B.81 utt1	I see.
sd	A.82 utt1	So, cause this was the first real job after getting my degree.
b	B.83 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	B.83 utt2	After your masters or after your,
sd	A.84 utt1	After my masters.
bk	B.85 utt1	I see.
sd	A.86 utt1	My undergraduate degree was not in what my masters was.
b	B.87 utt1	I see.
sd	A.88 utt1	So I made a career change basically.
b	B.89 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.91 utt1	I see.
^h	B.91 utt2	Well, let's see
aa	B.91 utt4	there's a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools, you know, just like you said.
sv	B.91 utt5	depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford, different things like that,
sd	B.91 utt6	so I have not really made up my mind, you know, whether to encourage them to go different places
b	A.92 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.94 utt1	One day I would like to, you know, the,
sd	A.94 utt2	I like the school where I went.
b	B.95 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.96 utt1	I mean, and I would not hesitate at all to encourage her to go there there if she wanted to.
b	B.97 utt1	Right.
b	B.99 utt1	Right.
sd	A.100 utt1	Or the school where I got my masters at, which was a different school.
b	B.101 utt1	Right.
sd	A.102 utt1	And, I liked it almost as well.
b	B.103 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.104 utt1	but, you know, that, I'm not going to hold them to that just because I went there.
b	B.105 utt1	Right.
sv	A.106 utt2	I, you know, think that's
b	B.107 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.108 utt1	If they want to, that's fine, but otherwise not. Although I would get quite a break on, on tuition .
b	B.109 utt1	Yeah.
qy^d	B.111 utt1	because you went there.
ny	A.112 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.112 utt2	because they, allow for, tuition, break for out of state students who children of alumnae.
sd	B.115 utt1	I didn't know that.
sd	A.116 utt1	Well certain schools do it.
b	B.117 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.118 utt1	This school does.
sd	A.120 utt2	I was involved in some, alumnae recruiting, here in town, recently, well last year .
b	B.121 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.122 utt1	and it was kind of fun, because you are to, trying to get people interested in your school, you know.
b	B.123 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.124 utt2	this was a college night at a high school in Richardson.
b	B.125 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.126 utt1	And there were a bunch of kids, you know, and a bunch of schools.
sv	A.126 utt2	There were a hundred schools, probably there all competing for the same kids.
b	B.127 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.129 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.130 utt1	It's kind of interesting to, to talk up, you know, your, school
aa	B.131 utt1	Yeah,
^2	B.131 utt2	your own school,
sd	A.132 utt2	And, I was surprised by the number of kids that came by and had heard of, you know, our school. and were interested in it.
b	B.133 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.136 utt2	situations like that, you don't realize, you know, until you start thinking about it, the kinds of advantages you school may have over others.
b	B.137 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.138 utt1	And so, I was real pleased with that.
sd	A.138 utt2	That worked out so well.
b	B.139 utt1	Yeah.
qy	B.139 utt2	So did you drum up any interest then
am	A.140 utt1	I think so.
no	A.142 utt1	I don't know offhand
sd	A.142 utt2	but, it seemed like there were quite a few kids that were definitely interested in going there.
b	B.143 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.144 utt2	So, there, There was one mother who, came by right, even, before we started, who obviously was, very interested in getting her daughter in or having gotten her daughter in or something
sd	A.146 utt2	and she was wanting some more information.
sd	A.146 utt3	But her, her daughter was, a, ma , dru , a majorette or something. You know, a baton twirler or something
b	B.147 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.149 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.150 utt1	and she was, letting us know how good her daughter was.
sd	A.152 utt1	She had cards printed up, actually describing, you know, business cards describing her daughter's, you know, she had won several different twirling awards, and all this,
b	B.153 utt1	really.
b	B.155 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.156 utt1	and she had these business cards she was passing out
sd	A.156 utt2	and it was quite a production.
sv	A.156 utt3	I think some parents go a little bit overboard.
aa	B.157 utt1	Yeah
aa	B.157 utt2	it sounds like it.
b	A.158 utt1	Yes.
sv	B.159 utt1	Well you know I think Richardson is probably you know one of the places that would definitely
