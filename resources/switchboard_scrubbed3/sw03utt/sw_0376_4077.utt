qo	A.1 utt1	How do you feel about gun control?
sv	B.2 utt1	Well, I mean I don't think that guns should be outlawed
sv	B.4 utt3	I mean all you do is to get guns and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen, Texas not too long ago, But I don't really know, I mean, unless they do, just outlaw them, how you can, prevent that.
b	A.5 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	A.9 utt1	Well, don't you think that you know, just having, you know, some, you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry.
ny	B.10 utt1	Yeah,
qy	B.10 utt3	well do you even know what the procedures are now?
sd	A.13 utt1	There is no national,
sv	B.14 utt1	But, it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun, especially if you have the money to pay for it.
sv	A.15 utt1	in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon. You know or on probation or, you know, other obvious things like that.
b	B.16 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.17 utt2	and I know that like in a lot of states you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before. You know, be obviously insane,
sd	A.17 utt3	you, you know but have your legal right to get a gun.
sd	B.18 utt1	I didn't know that.
ba	B.18 utt2	Well, that's pretty scary.
qy^t	B.18 utt3	So, now do they want us to say where we feel about it, like in rating it one to ten.
ny	A.19 utt1	yeah,
sd^e	A.19 utt2	I'd probably say about a five.
sd	B.20 utt1	That's where I would probably be .
sv	A.21 utt1	Seems like it's a good safe number to pick, you know.
sd	B.22 utt1	Well, I mean, I mean I don't really know how they can really enforce the laws any better
b	A.23 utt1	Uh huh .
sv	B.24 utt1	because I mean I do think that some people need them like, for protection and stuff
b	A.25 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.26 utt1	and I can understand them wanting to have them,
sv	B.26 utt2	but then again it's just like all those nuts out there.
sv	A.27 utt2	if you are looking at like you know country where they do have a lot more gun control, like England and places like that, you know
sv	A.27 utt3	the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much.
bh	B.28 utt1	It has?
ny	A.29 utt1	Well I mean yeah.
sv^e	A.29 utt3	in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States.
sv	A.31 utt1	you know, I mean, the problem though, you know, since the United States had this, you know, pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that I think, you know, if you were introduced, you know, any controls, it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already.
b	B.32 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.33 utt1	You know, so it's really kind of a complex problem.
qy	B.34 utt1	Well, is the crime that bad there in Atlanta?
no	A.35 utt1	I'm not really sure how bad it is.
sd	A.35 utt2	I've not really had that many problems with it,
sd	A.35 utt3	but I mean apparently we were ranked pretty high up.
b	B.36 utt1	Yeah
sd	B.36 utt2	I know Dallas is.
sd	A.37 utt2	I mean I think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years.
sd	B.38 utt1	I don't know if Dallas is in the top three
b	A.39 utt1	Uh huh.
qy	B.40 utt1	but. Do you own a gun?
nn	A.41 utt1	No.
sd^e	A.41 utt2	I've thought about getting one.
sd	A.41 utt3	If I get one, I think I will probably, you know, get something.
sd	A.41 utt4	I probably wouldn't get a hand gun.
sd	A.41 utt5	I would probably get like a shotgun.
sd	A.41 utt6	Just for protecting myself. You know, from burglar type thing.
b	B.42 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.43 utt2	I do kind of live in the downtown area.
b	B.44 utt1	Yeah.
sv	A.45 utt1	You know and shotguns are really good because they're,
sv	A.45 utt2	I mean somebody is not going to break in, steal it, and you know, use it to mug someone, you know.
aa	B.46 utt1	That's true.
sd	A.47 utt3	I just don't understand these people, you know, like when they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves.
sv	A.47 utt4	They go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know,
sv	A.47 utt5	they are probably going to miss the person
sv	A.47 utt6	and they're going to shoot through five wall, and hit someone, you know.
sv	A.49 utt2	I mean a shotgun just really struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon.
sv	A.49 utt3	You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever.
b	B.50 utt1	Yeah.
sd@	B.52 utt1	Well, Well, now when I first moved to Dallas, I moved up here by myself
sv	A.53 utt1	You pretty much stop them.
sv	A.53 utt3	then the actual shot doesn't go that far, you know, a wall will stop it pretty much.
sd	B.54 utt2	and, my Dad gave me a gun
b	A.55 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.56 utt1	but I never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it
b	A.57 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.58 utt1	so I finally ended up giving it back to him.
sd(^q)	B.58 utt2	I said I don't want it.
^q	B.58 utt3	I don't want to be responsible for it because you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if I am not going to, you know, be responsible enough to go out and learn, I don't need it.
b	A.59 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.61 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.65 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.65 utt2	that really does scare me. People, you know, that have guns
sv	A.65 utt3	because you know, if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot,
sv	A.65 utt4	but you pick up the gun and point it at the person that person rushes you.
b	B.66 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.68 utt1	And they get it from you.
sv	A.69 utt1	And you know, you're pretty much dead you know. Because you've just told the person that you're about to kill them then, You know
b	B.70 utt1	Uh huh.
^2	B.72 utt1	Set them off.
sv	A.73 utt2	and, well I mean, you basically made it clear to the person you know unless he, unless, you know that you are a real danger to them
sv	A.73 utt3	and then you know if they manage to get the gun from you, you know their first reaction is going to you know, stop you.
aa	B.74 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.74 utt2	well that's why I ended up giving it back to him.
sd(^q)	B.74 utt3	I thought well you know. I don't want it you know, if I don't really know how to use it
b	A.75 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.77 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.78 utt1	and I just didn't want the responsibility.
qy	B.80 utt1	So. Well, did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever?
ny	A.81 utt1	Yeah,
qy	A.81 utt2	did it happen at a cafeteria or something?
ny	B.82 utt1	Yeah,
na	B.82 utt2	right.
sv^e	B.82 utt3	That kind of I mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns.
b	A.83 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.84 utt2	I would be scared selling guns to people.
