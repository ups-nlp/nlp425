o	A.1 utt1	All right.
b	B.2 utt1	Okay,
qy	B.2 utt2	are you on an exercise program now
ny	A.3 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.3 utt2	I exercise pretty regularly.
bk	B.4 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.5 utt1	I lift weights quite a bit.
bk	B.6 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.7 utt1	I run occasionally.
sd	A.7 utt2	Let's see what else do I do. Play golf some,
sd	A.7 utt3	and I work out on a hanging bag.
sd	A.7 utt4	I'm brown belt in karate,
sd	A.7 utt5	so I keep up with that a little bit.
bk	B.8 utt1	Uh huh.
bk	B.10 utt1	yeah.
qo	A.11 utt1	How about you.
sd	B.12 utt1	the only exercise program I'm doing right now is walking.
bk	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.14 utt1	I've got a nine month old,
sd	B.14 utt2	and I'm four months pregnant with my second,
sv	B.14 utt3	and so, at the time, walking seems to be the best.
sd	B.14 utt4	It's something I can do with her, plus, doesn't tax me too physically.
bk	A.15 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.16 utt1	I have enjoyed aerobics in the past,
sd	B.16 utt2	and I enjoy that because I like the group association, you know, like exercising with other people.
bk	A.17 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.18 utt1	and that's my favorite way to exercise.
ba	A.19 utt1	Well, that's neat.
sd	A.19 utt3	I do walk some too.
sd	A.19 utt4	My wife's about five months along
b	B.20 utt1	Oh.
sd	A.21 utt1	so she's been walking quite a bit,
aa	A.21 utt2	so that is a good exercise for that.
aa	B.22 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.22 utt2	it's nice to do it together, too, I guess.
b	A.23 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.24 utt1	My husband and I use to walk together,
sd	B.24 utt2	but our schedules don't coincide as well as they used to,
sd	B.24 utt3	and so, we very seldom get together to walk
qy	B.24 utt4	but, when you work out, do you pretty much do it on your own schedule,
qrr	B.24 utt5	or do you go to groups
sd	A.25 utt1	I do it on my own schedule.
b	B.26 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.27 utt1	We used to try and belong to clubs or the Y, stuff like that,
sd	A.27 utt2	but it was so difficult to go on a regular basis, to drive the distance you have to go.
b	B.28 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.29 utt2	we've, just save the fees and buy some of our own equipment.
sv	B.30 utt1	And then you can do it whenever you want I guess.
aa	A.31 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.31 utt2	I've got a weight bench,
sd	A.31 utt3	and we got my wife an exercise bike,
sd	A.31 utt4	and I use that sometimes too.
b	B.32 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.33 utt1	It's a little more convenient,
sv	A.33 utt2	but, I guess you're not as dedicated if you don't drive over to do it.
sv	B.34 utt1	I guess it depends on the person, depends on how motivated you are.
b	A.35 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.36 utt1	Because my husband used to work out three days a week at the Texas Instruments gym.
b	A.37 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.38 utt1	And then I would just go on Saturdays.
sd	B.38 utt2	But, since the first of the year neither one of us have been going.
b	A.39 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.40 utt1	So, I guess, like I say, we've been paying these fees and not going,
sv	B.40 utt2	so it's kind of a waste of money if you don't take advantage of it.
aa	A.41 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.41 utt2	I think you really have to be disciplined.
b	B.42 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.43 utt1	I try to work out at least a couple of times a week,
sv	A.43 utt2	and I think you really have to, at least twice a week, just to maintain the shape that you're in.
aa	B.44 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.44 utt2	With the walking, I think they said you need to walk at least twelve miles a week for it to be aerobically beneficial.
b	A.45 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.46 utt1	And I have two friends, that we walk.
sd	B.46 utt2	They have babies that are about the same ages as mine,
sd	B.46 utt3	and we've been walking every morning going
sd	B.46 utt4	when it was cold we would go to the mall because you can't take the babies out very easily.
b	A.47 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.48 utt2	So when we go, we do about fifteen miles a week,
sd	B.48 utt3	but the last little while, for one reason or another, we haven't been real consistent.
sv	B.48 utt4	So it's a little harder when you're depending on other people to do it with you because you have to meet their schedules as well,
b	A.49 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.50 utt2	but but I enjoy doing it more when I've got other people with me.
aa	A.51 utt1	Sure.
sd	B.52 utt2	You know, I usually do it because I want to, because I know it's good for me, not because, I don't feel obligated to do it.
sd	B.52 utt3	I enjoy it.
sd	B.52 utt4	If I feel too obligated to do it,
sd	B.52 utt5	I start to rebel,
sd	B.52 utt6	and I won't be as consistent with it.
aa	A.53 utt1	Yeah,
ba	A.53 utt2	I understand.
qy	A.53 utt3	Did you exercise between your first child and your second?
na	B.54 utt1	I exercised pretty well up until I was pregnant,
sd	B.54 utt2	and I started having pains.
sd	B.54 utt3	So I've calmed down everything except, I was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the, walking,
b	A.55 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.56 utt1	And I had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of painful.
sd	B.56 utt2	But the T I rec center has an aerobics program for, prenatal and postnatal aerobic type thing.
sd	B.58 utt1	And I was going to wait until, about my sixth month and then start that.
sd	B.58 utt2	I did that with the second baby,
sd	B.58 utt3	and, I went to my exercise class one day,
sd	B.58 utt4	and then she was delivered the next day.
ba	A.59 utt1	Gosh.
sv	B.60 utt1	So, it would seem to be real beneficial.
aa	A.61 utt1	Uh huh,
aa	A.61 utt2	yeah.
qy^d	A.61 utt3	maybe it speeded up the process and all that.
nd	B.62 utt1	Well I think it made parts of it a lot easier.
qy	B.62 utt2	and is this your first that you're having?
ny	A.63 utt1	Uh huh.
bk	B.64 utt1	okay,
qw^d	B.64 utt2	well, then I don't know how much you've been through it,
sv	B.64 utt3	but I think parts of it made a lot easier.
sd	B.64 utt4	And, I've talked to a lot of ladies that exercise with one pregnancy and didn't with the other,
sd	B.64 utt5	and they said that the one they had exercised with was three or four times easier.
b	A.65 utt1	Really.
sd	B.66 utt2	having both of them natural, the first one was natural and going natural the second,
sv	B.66 utt3	and it's rough
sd	B.66 utt4	but it's not as bad as I thought it would be,
sv	B.66 utt5	and I think the exercise helped.
ba	A.67 utt1	Well, that's good.
qy	B.68 utt1	So, do you work with T I?
nn	A.69 utt1	No,
sd^e	A.69 utt2	I don't.
sd	A.69 utt3	my wife has been working with them.
bk	B.70 utt1	okay,
sd	B.70 utt2	well then she could go if she were interested.
b	A.71 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.72 utt1	I think, that's what the class that meets on Saturday mornings.
sd	B.72 utt2	So she could find out if she wanted to go.
sd	B.72 utt3	It's kind of fun because with the first pregnancy all the other ladies except one were on their first pregnancy,
sd	B.72 utt4	and they would talk about exercise and just general things relating to the birthing process.
sd	B.72 utt5	And so for us it was educational as well as exercise beneficial.
sd	A.73 utt1	At least its something you enjoy.
sd(^q)	A.73 utt2	I know a lot of people that talk about exercise and say, Well, I don't want to exercise, it's too much work.
sv	A.73 utt3	But there's a lot of different things you can do that are enjoyable that you don't have to strain yourself or sweat or be real sore afterwards.
aa	B.74 utt1	That's right.
aa	B.76 utt1	Yeah.
sv(^q)	B.76 utt2	And sometimes if you get a little soreness you feel like, Well I've done a good job because I worked myself to that point.
sv	B.76 utt3	But I guess that you don't want to overdo.
qy^t	B.76 utt4	But , well have we reached our limit?
sd^t	B.76 utt5	I'm not sure how long we've been talking
ny	A.77 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.77 utt2	I think we've talked about six minutes or so.
fc	B.78 utt1	Okay,
fc	B.78 utt2	well it's been good talking to you.
fc	A.79 utt1	Been good talking to you as well.
fc	B.80 utt1	Okay,
fc	B.80 utt2	I hope your baby goes well comes out well.
fc	A.81 utt1	Thanks.
fc	A.83 utt1	Yours too.
fc	B.84 utt1	Bye bye.
fc^m	A.85 utt1	Bye bye.
