o	A.1 utt1	Okay.
qy	A.1 utt2	do you live in a home?
ny	B.2 utt1	Yes.
b	A.3 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.4 utt1	we, it's a house we bought, about two and a half years ago now.
bh	A.5 utt1	did you?
ny	B.6 utt1	Uh huh.
b^m	A.7 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.8 utt1	First house.
sd	A.9 utt1	We've lived in ours for about six years.
sd	A.9 utt2	We had it built, actually.
b	B.10 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.11 utt1	And, it's our first home, too.
b	B.12 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.13 utt1	Yeah.
qo	B.14 utt1	So what do you think of owning a home as opposed to renting somebody else's?
sd	A.15 utt1	well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in,
b	B.16 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.17 utt2	and, that was quite an experience .
sd	A.19 utt1	I much prefer having my own home and, just the space and more privacy.
b	B.20 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.21 utt1	Yeah.
qy	B.22 utt1	is it a fairly large house?
sd	A.23 utt1	it's like twenty four fifty square feet.
ba	B.24 utt1	that's pretty good size.
sd	A.25 utt1	It's a two story.
b	B.26 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.27 utt1	Yeah.
qo	A.27 utt2	How about yours?
sd	B.28 utt1	It's tiny.
qy	A.29 utt1	Is it small?
na	B.30 utt1	It's not much bigger.
sd	B.30 utt2	Actually we had an two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is.
bh	A.31 utt1	really.
ny	B.32 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	B.32 utt2	it's only like eleven hundred square feet.
b	A.33 utt1	uh huh.
qy	A.33 utt2	do you have children?
sd	B.34 utt1	Just one.
b^m	A.35 utt1	Just one.
b	B.36 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.38 utt1	But, it, all the rooms are small, I mean,
sd	B.38 utt2	but it ends up giving us three bedrooms, which we wanted. And, Use an extra one for an office which is handy.
b	A.39 utt1	uh huh.
b	A.41 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.42 utt1	I'd rather have more rooms and less space in each one I guess. Rather have lots of rooms and lots of space,
sd	B.42 utt2	but, that ends up costing me.
b	A.43 utt1	yeah,
b	A.45 utt1	yeah.
qw	A.45 utt2	Well, like, how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood? .
sd	B.46 utt1	Well, it's pretty typical, I mean, it's a very, very middle class neighborhood.
sd	B.46 utt2	lots of young couples with, you know, usu ,
sd	B.46 utt3	I'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood, that's their first homes
b	A.47 utt1	uh huh.
sd	B.48 utt1	and, lots of kids and stuff,
sd	B.48 utt2	and, so it fits well, in the neighborhood.
sd	B.48 utt3	it's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood,
sd	B.48 utt4	but on the other hand, it's clean and kind of suburban little bit more than I want.
b	A.49 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.51 utt1	Yeah.
qy	B.52 utt1	is yours also pretty much in conformance with the neighborhood
ny	A.55 utt1	Yeah,
sd^e	A.55 utt2	it, it, it does, it seems about, probably average.
qrr	B.56 utt1	or is it?
b	B.58 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.59 utt1	But our neighborhood has just a wide variety of, people,
sd	A.59 utt2	and, you know, there's older people here, and, people that are our age,
sd	A.59 utt3	we're in our thirties.
b	B.60 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.61 utt1	And, there's a lot of kids.
sd	A.61 utt2	People across the street have eight.
b	B.62 utt1	Uh huh,
bh	B.62 utt2	wow, eight kids?
ny	A.63 utt1	Uh huh.
ba	B.64 utt1	my gosh.
b	A.65 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.65 utt2	their home just burned down matter of fact, last summer,
b	B.66 utt1	Ooh.
sd	A.67 utt2	and they're just rebuilding
sd	A.67 utt3	and, their house is going to be really big .
aa	B.68 utt1	I'm sure, with eight,
ba	B.68 utt2	gosh.
b	A.69 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.69 utt2	they're building a lot bigger.
sd	A.69 utt3	He's, not an obstetrician, an orthopedic surgeon.
b	B.70 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.71 utt1	so since the house did burn, they're going,
sd	A.71 utt2	it's quite different than it was before,
sd	A.71 utt3	and it's it's a lot bigger.
b	B.72 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.74 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.75 utt1	but ours is about,
sd	A.75 utt2	you know, it's a nice home,
sd	A.75 utt3	it's definitely not one of the smaller ones,
sd	A.75 utt4	and, it's not the biggest either.
b	B.76 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.76 utt2	new ones, I mean, they tend to be real tiny, especially in newer neighborhoods,
sd	B.76 utt3	my brother just built a new house.
sd	B.76 utt4	He lives in Wichita, Kansas,
sd	B.76 utt5	and the neighborhood actually fought him on it,
sd	B.76 utt6	because he was, the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood.
sd	B.78 utt1	Now, that's because he's doing a lot of it himself you know, for example, landscaping and lots of the other stuff,
b	A.79 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.80 utt2	and his house actually ended up being nicer than lots in the neighborhood,
sd	B.80 utt3	but but they were pretty touchy on it.
b	A.81 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.82 utt2	He was a little surprised.
ba	A.83 utt1	You know, that's interesting
sd	A.83 utt2	you say that, because we have those architectural codes here
b	B.84 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.85 utt1	and when we, put out house in, they wanted us to have,
sd	A.85 utt3	we have part siding on the two story part and then on the back,
b	B.86 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.88 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.89 utt2	and, there was one side where our chimney was,
sd	A.89 utt3	and just the chimney was going to be brick,
sd	A.89 utt4	and they wanted us to have more brick,
sd	A.89 utt5	so we ended up having to go halfway up
b	B.90 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.91 utt1	it does look nicer,
sd	A.91 utt2	and, you know, we would have like to have had all brick,
sd	A.91 utt3	but, of course at that point we couldn't afford it,
sd	A.91 utt4	but, it's funny that you'd say that, because there were homes in here that didn't have any brick at all.
b	B.92 utt1	Right.
sv	A.93 utt1	So it's kind of like, they were.
sv	B.94 utt1	Kind of depends on when they get in, you know.
aa	A.95 utt1	Yeah,
aa^r	A.95 utt2	yeah,
sd	A.95 utt4	ours is the last street that they built on.
sd	A.95 utt5	So the houses actually on our street they're kind of gone a little bit nicer.
b^m	A.97 utt1	Yeah,
b	B.98 utt1	Yeah,
b	B.98 utt2	oh.
sd	A.99 utt2	it's like the second phase
b	B.100 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.101 utt1	and so they've kind of changed the codes a little bit,
sd	A.101 utt2	and so that's kind of why, I guess, they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didn't have any.
sd	B.104 utt1	Well, see, my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that, because they moved into a neighborhood and bought a real nice stone house down in South Austin.
b	A.105 utt1	uh huh.
sd	B.106 utt1	and, what the builder apparently plans to do, is they do phase one,
sd	B.106 utt2	and they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled, codes and, and stuff,
sd	B.106 utt3	and then they come back in,
sd	B.106 utt4	and then they sell,
