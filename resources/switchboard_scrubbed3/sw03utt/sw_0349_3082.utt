qy	A.1 utt1	Okay?
ny	B.2 utt1	Yes.
sd	A.3 utt1	Well, this is a very timely topic inasmuch as we're going to a family reunion this weekend.
bh	B.4 utt1	are you really?
ny	A.5 utt1	Yeah.
qw	B.6 utt1	Where is it going to be?
sd	A.7 utt1	Down at Lake Texoma lodge.
bk	B.8 utt1	Oh.
b	A.9 utt1	Yes,
sd	A.9 utt2	this is one that's, the Baker family reunion
b	B.10 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.11 utt1	and this has been going on I would say, at least twenty five years or thirty, something like that.
ba	B.12 utt1	that's marvelous.
sd	A.15 utt1	Maybe longer than that, I'm going to get back into the fifties sometime.
b	B.16 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.17 utt1	First time, I married into the family,
sd	A.17 utt2	and the first time I went was about fifty seven, I think.
b	B.18 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.19 utt1	But, this one has been well organized
sd	A.19 utt2	and in fact it used to be at Lake Brownwood,
sd	A.19 utt3	and now it's Lake Texoma, because that's more central location for people from Oklahoma and Texas to come to.
b	B.20 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.22 utt1	I'm sure location's really important as far as figuring out where one ought to be.
aa	A.23 utt1	Very important, because, you'll start losing people if it's too far to go.
aa	B.24 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.24 utt2	We have factions, when it's one part,
sd	B.24 utt3	I have one reunion on my mother's side,
sd	B.24 utt4	and we found that if it's in a certain part of Texas, some people come,
sd	B.24 utt5	and if it's elsewhere, other people come
b	A.25 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.26 utt1	we never get them at both of them
bf	A.27 utt1	Never get them at both places,
aa	B.28 utt1	it seems like,
sv	B.28 utt2	so I think we need to find a new place .
aa	A.29 utt1	Right.
ad	A.29 utt2	Well, listen, they've had this one,
sd	A.29 utt4	of course, over the years it has, built up as far as the organization is concerned
b	B.30 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.31 utt1	but now they, have a golf tournament on the Saturday.
sd	A.33 utt1	And then they have generally a show or an auction or something on Saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such.
ba	B.34 utt1	that's a neat idea.
aa	A.35 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.35 utt2	and, they get the community building there at Lake Texoma lodge,
sd	A.35 utt3	and everyone brings in food
b	B.36 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.37 utt1	and then for the Saturday night dinner they bring in like Kentucky Fried Chicken from Durant,
sd	A.37 utt2	and it really, has worked out.
b	B.38 utt1	Uh huh.
qw	B.40 utt1	How many people, Jim, are involved?
sd	A.41 utt1	generally, I think it's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people.
ba	B.42 utt1	Wow.
sd	A.43 utt1	I think normal's about sixty or seventy.
b	B.44 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.44 utt2	well, I guess, ours probably isn't that big.
sd	B.44 utt3	Our family is dwindling, for one thing.
b	A.45 utt1	Oh .
sd	B.46 utt1	And I often feel funny because I'm in a branch that's all but died
b	A.47 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.48 utt1	I just have one aunt and my family.
sd	B.48 utt2	So sometimes when these other families get together, they're really pulling in aunts and uncles and grandkids,
b	A.49 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.50 utt2	and we're kind of off on the sidelines.
sd	B.50 utt3	But it does remind us that we have family and roots.
b	A.51 utt1	Right.
sd	B.52 utt1	So we keep going even though we're not a real big part of it.
b	A.53 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.53 utt2	well, our family reunion started out my wife
sd	A.53 utt3	and I were the kids, the newlyweds, so to speak
b	B.54 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.55 utt1	and now our children go,
sd	A.55 utt2	and our grandchildren are going now.
ba	B.56 utt1	that's great.
sd	A.57 utt1	So it's, wound up that, we're the old folks now.
b	B.58 utt1	Uh huh,
b^r	B.58 utt2	uh huh.
sd	A.59 utt1	But, they have various organized,
sd	A.59 utt2	they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes, to pitch,
sd	A.59 utt3	and they organize a baseball game for the kids
b	B.60 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.61 utt1	and several people bring boats,
sd	A.61 utt2	and there's a place they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon,
sd	A.61 utt3	so it it's a full day.
bf	B.62 utt1	So there's lots to do.
sd	A.63 utt2	Some of the people come down on Friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend,
b	B.64 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.65 utt2	and some just come in for Saturday
b	B.66 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.67 utt1	so, it, has worked out quite well,
sd	A.67 utt2	and it's a chance to see some of the relatives you don't see all year long except that once a year.
b	B.68 utt1	Uh huh
aa	B.70 utt1	that's true.
ba	B.70 utt2	Well, that's neat.
sv	B.70 utt3	I think they're really fun.
sd	B.70 utt4	We go to mine regularly,
sd	B.70 utt5	and then we go to my husband's occasionally down in Temple,
sd	B.70 utt6	and he has a large family,
sd	B.70 utt7	so it's fun when we go to that one.
b	A.71 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.71 utt2	my side of the family is from back in Ohio and West Virginia,
sd	A.71 utt3	and I think we've been to one in thirty five years or something like that,
sd	A.71 utt4	so, That's just too far away.
b	B.72 utt1	Oh.
b	B.74 utt1	Yeah,
b^r	B.74 utt2	yeah
sv	B.74 utt3	that is a problem with the distance.
sd	B.74 utt4	The people that we have that don't come are out El Paso way
b	A.75 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.76 utt1	and it's just too much for all of them, all of that group to travel.
sv	A.77 utt1	It's an, all day drive just to get to this area.
aa	B.80 utt1	Right.
sd	B.80 utt2	But then we have the same attitude when it's out, there, although this year we're going out.
sd	B.82 utt2	They're going to have it at Fort Davis
b	A.83 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.84 utt1	and we thought that would be fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion.
b	A.85 utt1	Yeah.
b	A.87 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.87 utt3	each year, of course, they elect officers of the family reunion
b	B.88 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.89 utt1	and a number of years ago, back in the early eighties, my wife was president.
sd	A.89 utt2	We discovered how much work it is just to organize and get it together. And it takes a lot of planning, and assembling of stuff.
b	B.90 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.92 utt1	And choose, some place that everybody's going to like as far as food and all that .
b	A.95 utt1	Right.
ba	A.97 utt1	That's correct.
sv	B.98 utt1	That's a heavy burden.
aa	A.99 utt1	Yes,
aa	A.99 utt2	it is,
aa	A.99 utt3	I tell you.
sd	A.101 utt1	I don't really care for her to be president again.
b	B.102 utt1	No .
sd	A.103 utt1	But it's, it's a lot of work,
sd	A.103 utt2	but it's a lot of fun.
b	B.104 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.105 utt1	We've enjoyed it,
sd	A.105 utt2	and the grandkids really enjoy it because it's the only time of the year they see all their cousins from Oklahoma.
b	B.108 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.108 utt2	and it's good for kids to know that they have other family.
aa	A.109 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.109 utt2	and this year they're all excited.
sd	A.109 utt4	this weekend's going to be a rock and roll show
ba	B.110 utt1	boy.
sd	A.111 utt1	my two grandsons and one of their cousins are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song you know, in jeans and t shirts and such.
ba	B.112 utt1	what fun.
b	B.114 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	A.115 utt1	So, it's going to be exciting for them, and for us too.
aa	B.116 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.116 utt2	Probably lots of laughs.
aa	A.117 utt1	yes,
sd	A.119 utt1	there have been some really wild shows put on there.
sd	A.119 utt2	They, really get, into it.
b	B.120 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.120 utt2	Well, it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it going along.
sd	B.120 utt3	ours is still kind of loosely organized,
sd	B.120 utt4	and the same people usually get stuck with doing it.
b	A.121 utt1	Yeah,
sv	A.121 utt2	well, that generally happens.
sd	B.122 utt2	And, they do it as a labor of love.
b	A.125 utt1	Yeah.
sv	B.126 utt1	So, the officer idea is a good idea.
aa	A.127 utt1	Yeah,
sd	A.127 utt2	well we've, had various things over the years, to raise funds for it
b	B.128 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.129 utt1	and again, it's not cheap to rent the lodge up there or the meeting room down in the cabins and such,
b	B.130 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.131 utt2	but, they've come up with,
b	B.132 utt1	Uh huh .
sd	A.133 utt2	they've tried passing the hat,
sd	A.133 utt3	and they've had auctions and various things to raise funds,
sd	A.133 utt4	and, some people do
b	B.134 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.135 utt2	and some people don't .
b	B.136 utt1	Yeah,
sv	B.136 utt2	and it's not fair that everybody not contribute,
fc	A.137 utt1	Excuse me. But, anyway, that's the family reunion story.
fc	B.138 utt1	Uh huh.
fc	A.139 utt1	Okay.
fc	B.140 utt1	Well, thanks a lot I enjoyed talking to you.
fc	B.140 utt2	Bye.
fc	A.141 utt1	Been nice talking to you.
fc^m	A.141 utt2	Bye.
