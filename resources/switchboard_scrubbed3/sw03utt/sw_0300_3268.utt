sd	A.1 utt1	Well, the types of vacations that I usually take,
sd	A.1 utt2	I usually come back more tired after my vacation, then I do, you know, before I take it.
sd	A.3 utt2	I need to definitely take a vacation where all I do is rest.
sd	A.3 utt3	And I guess to do that I'd probably have to take it at home.
b	B.4 utt1	Oh .
sd	A.5 utt1	But, the vacation spots that I like to go to are places like the Bahamas and Florida.
sd	A.5 utt2	I enjoy the beach.
sd	B.6 utt1	after our last summer's vacation I am antibeach.
b^m	A.7 utt1	Antibeach.
b	B.8 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.8 utt2	We went to, Cape Hatteras.
b	A.9 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.10 utt1	Well, we were out visiting one of our kids in Maryland,
sd	B.10 utt2	and we went down to Cape Hatteras for a few days.
b	A.11 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.12 utt1	And, the waves were huge.
sd	B.12 utt2	I've never quite seen waves like this one
b	A.13 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.14 utt1	and, I was standing in water not more than, barely above my ankles
b	A.15 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.16 utt1	and, you know when the waves go in the waves go out they kind of all of a sudden you're in sand above your ankles.
b	A.17 utt1	Right.
sd	B.18 utt1	And I was standing there talking to my daughter
sd	B.18 utt2	and this really big wave came and totally threw me,
sd	B.18 utt3	and one foot did not come out of the sand,
sd	B.18 utt4	and it tore the ligaments in my knee .
b	A.19 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.20 utt1	So I'm never going to another beach again, ever.
sv	A.21 utt1	You might be like I am.
sd	A.21 utt2	I enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas,
sd	A.21 utt3	but I really don't like to get in the ocean.
sd	A.21 utt4	I prefer a swimming pool .
sd	B.22 utt1	Well, I love to go and play around.
sd	B.22 utt2	At least I always did although actually, I like the mountains.
sd	B.22 utt3	I, I don't really like hot weather
b	A.23 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.24 utt2	that's my biggest gripe about living here.
b	A.25 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.26 utt1	And I basically, don't want to go to a hot place on vacation .
b	A.27 utt1	Right.
ba	A.27 utt2	I can understand that.
b	B.28 utt1	Oh.
sd	B.28 utt2	my dream vacation is Alaska.
b	A.29 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.30 utt1	This is just someplace I've always wanted to go
ba	A.31 utt1	That would be nice.
sd	B.32 utt2	and someday I hope we can afford to just take a humdinger of a vacation up there.
b	A.33 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.33 utt2	I know I've taken several vacations to Colorado,
sd	A.33 utt3	and I used to live in Colorado, sometime ago for a couple of years,
sd	A.33 utt4	and I really enjoyed that.
b	B.34 utt1	Uh huh.
b	B.34 utt2	Yeah,
sd	B.34 utt3	I'd like that.
sd	B.34 utt4	I haven't been to Yellowstone for a long, long time
b	A.35 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.36 utt1	and we've been talking about going there next summer .
sd	B.36 utt2	I don't know we'll have to,
b	A.37 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.37 utt2	I've never been up to the Yellowstone area.
sd	B.38 utt1	It's been a long time.
sv	B.38 utt2	But you know, it seems when your family is different places, a lot of trips involved going to visit .
aa	A.39 utt1	That's right.
aa^m	A.39 utt2	That's right.
aa	A.39 utt3	You got that.
sd	B.40 utt2	we usually go up to Wisconsin at least once a year because this is where my husband and I are both from.
b	A.41 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.42 utt2	And my mother and his mother live up there feeling lost and alone because we moved down here .
b	A.43 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.45 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	B.46 utt1	And, we've got one of our kids lives out on the east coast
sd	B.46 utt2	and so we have to, you know, go to those.
sv	A.47 utt1	Well, you have a lot of vacation areas you can go to then.
aa	B.48 utt1	Well, I know
sd	B.48 utt2	but I'm tired of them .
b	A.49 utt1	Right.
sd	B.50 utt1	I want to go someplace different up there.
aa	A.51 utt1	That's right.
sv(^q)	B.52 utt1	my idea I guess of the ideal vacation would be to begin with, money be no object. You know, so just absolutely, you know, first class fly where I want to, rent a car if I want to. you know, just really the nicest hotels and stuff like that and and not worry if somebody says, well, let's take this little side trip, you know, and not have to sit there and figure out, you know, again we fit that in there or not.
b	A.53 utt1	Right.
b	A.55 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.57 utt1	Uh huh.
b	A.59 utt1	Right.
b	A.59 utt2	Uh huh.
sd	B.60 utt1	And, that's what I, you know, that's what I would like to do.
sd	B.60 utt2	I have no interest, for example, in taking a cruise.
b	A.61 utt1	Uh huh.
sv	B.62 utt1	To me why somebody would want to ride around on a boat for a few days is mind boggling.
sv	A.63 utt2	I feel like it would be confining.
b	B.64 utt1	Yeah.
sd	A.65 utt1	You know I would much rather get on a plane and get there and then enjoy myself.
b	B.66 utt1	Uh huh .
b	B.68 utt1	Yeah,
sd	B.68 utt3	that does absolutely nothing for me.
b	A.69 utt1	Uh huh.
h	B.70 utt1	But, I don't know
sd	B.70 utt2	I can say that I think my favorite spots are still to go where there's mountains and a lot of trees and wildlife to view
sd	B.70 utt3	and, I like that kind of stuff.
sd	B.70 utt4	I could just sit there all day and look at the scenery .
aa	A.71 utt1	Yes.
aa	A.73 utt1	I agree.
sd	A.73 utt2	I can do that too,
sd	A.73 utt3	and, you know, I think if I had the money, I would probably go to Europe every year.
sd	A.75 utt1	Because, you know, I think that they have it all over there in just a few tiny, two miles.
b	B.78 utt1	Uh huh.
sd	A.79 utt1	You know, there's mountains
sd	A.79 utt2	and there's beaches
sd	A.79 utt3	and it's all right there.
aa	B.80 utt1	Yeah.
sd	B.80 utt2	I guess I've never really thought about it that way.
sd	B.80 utt4	we have a daughter who's almost thirteen
sd	B.80 utt5	but she's, a very picky eater
b	A.81 utt1	Uh huh.
sd(^q)	B.82 utt2	and our standard excuse for not going someplace like that is, you know, gee, Holly would starve to death if you know, we took her into the country
b	A.83 utt1	Oh.
sv	B.84 utt2	so . So, but I would like if, you know it was anywhere in the world to go, I guess, even though it's hot,
b	A.85 utt1	Right.
sd	B.86 utt2	I would like to go to Africa.
